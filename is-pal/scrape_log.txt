      Israel’s invasion of Gaza is proceeding more slowly than expected. That may suit the needs of its allies — and its adversaries, analysts say.
      In the 23 harrowing days since Hamas attacked Israeli civilians and soldiers, Israel’s Western allies have had to perform a delicate balancing act: expressing steadfast support for the country during its darkest hours, while navigating the growing public anger on their streets over the intensifying bombardment of Gaza.

      The initial decision to undertake limited ground incursions rather than a full-scale invasion appears to follow guidance from top U.S. military officials.
      Israel’s apparent decision to hold off on a full-scale invasion of the Gaza Strip and instead conduct more limited ground incursions, at least initially, aligns with suggestions that the U.S. defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, made to his Israeli counterparts in recent days, American officials said on Saturday.

      The Biden administration has suggested that more time is needed for hostage negotiations, the delivery of aid to Palestinians and mapping out ways to avoid more civilian casualties.
      The Biden administration has advised Israel to delay a ground invasion of Gaza, hoping to buy time for hostage negotiations and to allow more humanitarian aid to reach Palestinians in the sealed-off enclave, according to several U.S. officials.

      Israeli officials completely underestimated the magnitude of the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, shattering the country’s once invincible sense of security.
       It was 3 a.m. on Oct. 7, and Ronen Bar, the head of Israel’s domestic security service, still could not determine if what he was seeing was just another Hamas military exercise.

      The explosion at a hospital highlights the dangers of a trip at a volatile moment in the war between Israel and Hamas.
      President Biden said on Tuesday that he was “outraged and deeply saddened” by a devastating blast that struck a hospital in Gaza City just hours before he left Washington for a wartime trip to Israel.

      A presidential trip to Israel at such a critical moment poses enormous challenges for the White House, in terms of both politics and security.
      President Biden will travel to Israel on Wednesday to show solidarity with America’s closest ally in the Middle East, in a wartime trip to bolster the country’s resolve to eradicate Hamas but also to urge limits on what seems bound to be a casualty-filled ground invasion of the Gaza Strip.

      U.S. officials cautioned that the analysis is preliminary and that the United States was continuing to collect and analyze evidence.
      American and Israeli officials said their intelligence showed that the deadly blast at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday was caused by an armed Palestinian group, rebutting Palestinian claims that an Israeli strike caused the explosion.

      China’s state-run media has blamed the United States for deepening the crisis, while perpetuating tropes of Jewish control of American politics.
      As the Israel-Hamas conflict intensifies, raising the prospect of a wider war, China has stepped up efforts to pitch itself as a neutral broker for Mideast peace.

      The ground operation, which began on Friday, remains shrouded in secrecy.
      Over the weekend, the Israeli military appears to have begun an invasion of the Gaza Strip, with tanks rolling into the enclave and Israeli soldiers fighting Hamas inside. But the operation remains shrouded in secrecy, and Israel is revealing little about its actions.

      The latest from the Israel-Hamas war. Weekday afternoons with Lulu Garcia-Navarro and Times journalists on the ground.
      The Israeli military said today that 240 people were taken hostage during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7. As Israeli forces move closer to Gaza City, families continue to demand that the government prioritize the safety and rescue of their loved ones.

      The war’s “next stage” has started.
      Israel announced it will attack Gaza from the air, land and sea, expanding its war against Hamas days after its tanks began an intense ground operation. The military again urged civilians to move south as troops have entered Gaza from the north (see where troops crossed the border).

      Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the small group of officials would play a key role in determining when Israel begins a ground invasion of Gaza.
      Before the deadly Hamas attack on Oct. 7, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was running a divisive government widely seen as the most conservative in Israel’s history. Amid anticipation of a protracted campaign to eradicate Hamas, Mr. Netanyahu responded to political pressure and formed a unity government that included opposition leaders.

      In the 19 days since Hamas attacked Israel, the Israeli military says it has struck more than 7,000 targets in Gaza. Palestinians accuse Israel of indiscriminately targeting civilians, but Israel officials say the strikes are aimed at eroding military infrastructure.
      Israel’s 19-day bombing campaign in Gaza has become one of the most intense of the 21st century, prompting growing global scrutiny of its scale, purpose and cost to human life.

      The conflict has raised questions about how much state aid the ultra-Orthodox and settlers receive.
      While the world’s eyes are on Gaza, another drama is unfolding in Jerusalem. There, lawmakers and government ministers are tussling over how to pay for the war against Hamas. There’s a debate over how much, if any, of the money should come from special allotments that were made earlier this year to the ultra-Orthodox and to settlers in the West Bank.

      One of the governor’s closest Jewish allies in the state publicly switched his support to Donald J. Trump, citing past incidents.
      As Israel’s war against Hamas has become an animating force in the Republican presidential primary, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has cast himself as a staunch defender of the Jewish state, sending taxpayer-funded charter flights to rescue Americans stranded in Israel, calling for harsh measures against the civilians of Gaza and ordering pro-Palestinian groups on public university campuses in his state to disband.

      The 19-year-old soldier was taken after Hamas gunmen overran and briefly captured a military base in Nahal Oz, just east of the northern Gaza Strip.
      The Israeli military said on Monday that it had rescued an Israeli soldier who was abducted from an Israeli army base on Oct. 7 and taken to Gaza during the Hamas-led terrorist attacks in Israel.

      The Brothers in Arms group helped lead protests against the government, with members vowing to ignore military call-ups. But after the Hamas attacks, it pivoted to aid those affected by the conflict.
      Made up largely of veterans and reservists, the group that calls itself Brothers in Arms started nine months ago as a protest movement against the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It helped to organize giant weekly demonstrations against his plans to give the government unprecedented control over the judiciary. And many of its members vowed that they would not serve in the army if called.

      The divisions are erupting as the House weighs a G.O.P. bid to censure the only Palestinian-American member of Congress for criticizing Israel and votes on a large aid bill to back Israel in the war in Gaza.
      Israel’s war against Hamas is exposing deep divisions among Democrats in Congress, as the most outspoken supporters of the Jewish state and vocal pro-Palestinian members on the left trade accusations of bigotry and feud over what role the United States should play in the hostilities.

      The head of Israel’s Holocaust memorial on Tuesday criticized the country’s ambassador to the U.N. for wearing a yellow Star of David patch during an address to the Security Council, saying the symbol, which was used under the Nazis to identify Jews, dishonors both the country and victims of the Holocaust.

      This week, a dramatic public battle has been playing out between the United Nations, Israel and the United States. On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council voted down two competing resolutions on the Israel-Hamas war.

      President Biden’s presence in Israel — and the message it sent — was more important than any tangible goals he achieved.
      President Biden flew into multiple headwinds on his risky trip to show solidarity with Israel on Wednesday. Even before his plane landed at Ben Gurion Airport, several allied Arab leaders announced they would not see him. He won a limited agreement from Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza but secured no promises that Israel would follow his urgent request to respond to the terrorist attack by Hamas with deliberate care and concern for the preservation of civilian life, rather than rage. He offered a small aid package for residents of Gaza and the West Bank but can’t do much more until Congress functions again.

      Six days after Hamas accused Israel of bombing a hospital in Gaza City and killing hundreds of people, the armed Palestinian group has yet to produce or describe any evidence linking Israel to the strike, says it cannot find the munition that hit the site and has declined to provide detail to support its count of the casualties.

      With the exception of the rare conservative, Hollywood has long seemed to exist in an ideological bubble — a bastion of progressive politics, where Jewish people have thrived, Democratic politicians have been celebrated and stars have espoused liberal ideas from the Oscar stage and rushed to support movements like Black Lives Matter.

      The terrorist attack by Hamas against Israelis — the worst massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust — was horrid, barbaric and inexcusable. Israel has a right to defend itself and pursue the perpetrators.

      Invading and depopulating Gaza would be inhumane and a potential violation of international law. The United States must do what it can to halt such actions.
      Israel has ordered more than a million people to leave northern Gaza, presumably to prepare for an imminent ground offensive. Its military strategists appear to be planning the depopulation and reoccupation of at least part of an area home to around 2.3 million people — nearly half of them children — and most of them descended from people driven from their homes before and during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. We must understand that these are human beings at grave risk, not just numbers.

      For the last two years, the debate over the American commitment to Ukraine has turned, in part, on whether we are endangering our ability to contain China in the Pacific if we pour too many resources into a trench war against Russia. From the hawkish perspective, the argument has been that any such trade-off is overstated or nonexistent — because Russia and China are allies, and when we weaken Russia we weaken both, because the kinds of military equipment necessary to defend Taiwan differ from the kinds we’re sending to Ukraine, because surely America has the resources to fight authoritarianism on two fronts.

      As Israel retaliates for the Hamas assault last weekend and plans a potential ground attack, its airstrikes have left Gazans without power, water and medical care.
      Six days of Israeli airstrikes have left more than 300,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip homeless, with two million residents facing critical shortages of food, water and fuel, while Israeli troops prepared on Thursday for a possible ground invasion after Hamas’s deadly weekend assault.

      Gov.

      The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday that the pace of the global economic recovery is slowing, a warning that came as a new war in the Middle East threatened to upend a world economy already reeling from several years of overlapping crises.

      There is a long history of misinformation being shared among Israeli and Palestinian groups, with false claims and conspiracy theories rising during moments of heightened violence in the region.
      Violent images and graphic videos flooded social media on Saturday, claiming to show the dead and wounded bodies of Israeli and Palestinian civilians.

      Israel had considered Hamas a terrorist organization but one that could play a useful role for Israel in the Gaza Strip, which the group controls. Now, senior Israeli officials say, Hamas must be crushed.
      Since its founding, Hamas has declared that Israel has no right to exist, that there are no Israeli civilians and that every Israeli citizen is a soldier of the state, and thus a legitimate target.

      Republicans renewed their opposition to President Biden’s decision to unfreeze $6 billion for humanitarian purposes as part of recent hostage release negotiations.
      Republican presidential candidates seized on the Hamas attack on Israel Saturday to try to lay blame on President Biden, drawing a connection between the surprise assault and a recent hostage release deal between the United States and Iran, a longtime backer of the group.

      The Times’s initial accounts of the blast attributed the claim of Israeli responsibility to Palestinian officials, and noted that the Israeli military said it was investigating the blast. However, the early versions of the coverage relied too heavily on claims by Hamas.
      On Oct. 17, The New York Times published news of an explosion at a hospital in Gaza City, leading its coverage with claims by Hamas government officials that an Israeli airstrike was the cause and that hundreds of people were dead or injured. The report included a large headline at the top of The Times’s website.

      As Iran rages over the mounting casualties in Gaza, fears are growing that its on-again-off-again proxy war with Israel will break out into a sustained conflict.
      The Middle East could be on the verge of a regional conflagration. That’s in stark contrast to the atmosphere of just a few weeks ago, when the Biden administration was working on sealing a historic deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel that it hoped would stabilize a region long convulsed by war and sectarianism.

      Why the U.S. wants Israel to pause a ground invasion in Gaza.
      For more than a week, an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza has seemed as if it might begin any day. Troops and tanks have crowded the border. Israel has ordered Gazans to evacuate south. The military has showered missiles on Hamas bunkers to weaken the group.

      The latest deployment is in response to growing threats from Iran and its allies in the region. President Biden has warned Iran to not join the war against Hamas.
      The U.S. military said it would send more missile defense systems to the Middle East in response to “escalations” from Iran and its allies, who have threatened a broader war in the region. The deployment comes as Israel continues to signal intentions to invade Gaza after Hamas’s deadly incursion earlier this month.

This was true even before social media and before Elon Musk acquired Twitter and turned it into the cesspool of misinformation, trolling and hysteria now called X. But today countless people are plugged into a frantically churning news cycle, trying to instantly metabolize a conflict that is a hall of mirrors in the best of times and is now careening toward a possible regional war, with all the propaganda and mass panic that entails. It’s an epistemological catastrophe that is putting people’s lives in danger.

      Not only Arabs in the street but, strikingly, also their rulers nearly uniformly condemned Israel for the Gaza hospital explosion and other violence affecting Palestinians.
      They donned the black-and-white checkered Palestinian scarf known as the kaffiyeh in Tunis, unfurled giant Palestinian flags in downtown Cairo and chanted against Israeli occupation in the normally sleepy Oman capital of Muscat. In Morocco and Bahrain, they demanded a reversal of their government’s normalization with Israel, the country they consider responsible for oppressing their Palestinian brethren.

      Much is unclear about the strike that Palestinian authorities say killed hundreds.
      Hundreds of people were feared dead after an explosion at a hospital in the Gaza Strip on Oct. 17, a little over a week after the Palestinian group Hamas staged a terrorist attack on Israel that killed 1,400 people and led Israel to declare war and begin bombing the territory.

      The access point, where aid trucks have entered from Egypt and people are waiting to leave, is the only land crossing into Gaza that Israel does not control.
      After Israel imposed a complete siege of the Gaza Strip in response to the deadly Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, the strip’s border crossing with Egypt became even more critical, as the only point not controlled by Israel where aid has come in and some people have been allowed out.

      Though the U.S. and Israel say they have cleared the way for the aid to make its way into Gaza, truckloads of supplies remain in Egypt.
      Israel said Wednesday it would not block aid to Gaza from Egypt, and there were already long lines of trucks parked in Egypt, at the Rafah border crossing, waiting to carry food, water and fuel to the enclave.

      Killing civilians doesn’t end extremism. It feeds it.
      On a reporting trip to Gaza two decades ago, I interrupted some high school boys playing soccer and asked them about their lives and hopes. The conversation veered to Israel and terrorism, so I quizzed them about whether they believed it would be morally acceptable for a Palestinian to bomb a group of Israeli women.

      Ethical resistance is the answer to grief and rage.
      In 1988, bombs exploded at restaurants, sporting events and arcades in South Africa. In response, the African National Congress, then in its 77th year of a struggle to overthrow white domination, did something remarkable: It accepted responsibility and pledged to prevent its fighters from conducting such operations in the future. Its logic was straightforward: Targeting civilians is wrong. “Our morality as revolutionaries,” the A.N.C. declared, “dictates that we respect the values underpinning the humane conduct of war.”

He began his national political career with a run for the Senate in 1972 that turned on his pledge to fight the Nixon administration’s escalation of the Vietnam War. He opposed that war less on moral grounds than on pragmatic ones: that the war was futile and needlessly drained American resources and power.

That was the day the Palestinians were offered a path to having their own nation on roughly 95 percent of the land in the West Bank and 100 percent of the land in the Gaza Strip. Under that outline, Israel would also swap some of its own land to compensate the Palestinians in exchange for maintaining 80 percent of its settler presence in the West Bank.

      The crisis in the Middle East must be analyzed in terms of great power politics and the pressure we face from broadly aligned rivals.
      Twenty-one years ago, in the shadow of the Sept. 11 attacks, George W. Bush warned of an “axis of evil,” encompassing the authoritarian and anti-American regimes of Iraq, Iran and North Korea. He did not claim that they were actually allies or partners in the style of Nazi Germany and imperial Japan. What made them an axis, in his rhetoric, was simply their ample cruelty, their shared pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their potential willingness to share such weapons with groups like Al Qaeda.

      For some Gazans, Saturday morning’s surprise Palestinian attack into southern Israel seemed a justified response to a 16-year Israeli blockade. Others worried that the coordinated attack would only add to Gaza’s misery as the tiny enclave braced for a large-scale response from Israel.

      For two days, Israeli troops have fought to expel Palestinian militants from Israeli territory, battling in firefights between homes, ducking under rocket fire and striking Gazan cities from the sky. In what officials described as the worst attack on Israel in decades, militants on Saturday infiltrated more than 20 Israeli towns and army bases. Read our timeline.

      Israel advances on Gaza City.
      The Israeli military advanced deeper into Gaza yesterday, approaching Gaza City from three directions. Israel has provided only limited details about the invasion, but photos and videos verified by The New York Times, as well as satellite imagery, showed troops and armored vehicles closing in on the city, Gaza’s largest, from the north, east and south. Israel has also continued to batter the territory with airstrikes.

      The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, called yesterday for a humanitarian cease-fire in Israel and Gaza in an address to the U.N. Security Council. He said that the attacks by Hamas that had left 1,400 people dead in Israel on Oct. 7 were “appalling” but that they did not justify the “collective punishment” of civilians in the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli military significantly stepped up its bombardment.

      Davis Polk, one of the country’s most prestigious law firms, recently rescinded employment offers made to three students who the firm believed led organizations at Harvard and Columbia that issued statements blaming Israel for the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that left more than 1,400 Israelis dead.On Tuesday, the firm said it was reconsidering that decision for two of the three students, who fought their dismissals and said they had not authorized the letters, which did not have any individual signatories. The potential reversal highlights the complexities — for both employers and employees — of navigating what has quickly become one of the most emotionally divisive issues in recent decades.

      The show’s first new broadcast in six months opened with a somber reflection by Davidson, the host, and included a brief appearance by Swift, who was a running theme of the episode.
      In its first new broadcast in six months, “Saturday Night Live” returned to a starkly serious world and to news developments seemingly impervious to any kind of comedic commentary. Would this topical sketch show in any way address the Israel-Hamas war? Should it? As it has in previous times of crisis, “S.N.L.” met the moment by taking things seriously, and in this case found an unexpectedly poignant spokesman in this week’s host, Pete Davidson.

      The first hotel I ever fell in love with was the Metropole, an old-world gem in Vietnam’s capital, Hanoi. My wife and I stayed there in 2007 on a break from covering the war in Iraq, and between the plush beds, the deep-ended pool in a quiet courtyard, and the rich history of the place as a hub of activity during the Vietnam War, we were smitten.

      As a high school exchange student in Chartres, France, in 2010, Aaron Gabriel Nastaskin developed a crush on Claire Marie-Elisabeth Rabut, a classmate, even texting a friend back home in California about her. But while she was curious about all things American, the crush went unrequited. In Ms. Rabut’s mind, a Los Angeles native was supposed to have long, blond hair. Plus, she had a boyfriend.

      Christian nationalism may not be serious, but it’s very dangerous. 
      The more I consider the challenge posed by Christian nationalism, the more I think most observers and critics are paying too much attention to the wrong group of Christian nationalists. We mainly think of Christian nationalism as a theology or at least as a philosophy. In reality, the Christian nationalist movement that actually matters is rooted in emotion and ostensibly divine revelation, and it’s that emotional and spiritual movement that so stubbornly clings to Donald Trump.

      In the first nearly 10 months of their majority, Republicans have nominated three different people to serve as speaker of the House, and not one of them currently holds the gavel. Jim Jordan’s defeat at the hands of mainly centrists, following the demise of Steve Scalise and Kevin McCarthy at the hands of conservatives, cements the idea that there may be no person who can unify the Republican conference.

      President Biden’s age is on the minds of American voters as they think about the 2024 election. It’s no wonder: In a poll I did last year, there was broad support (63 percent of Democrats, 55 percent of Republicans and 61 percent of independents) for establishing an upper age limit of 70 for any person to be sworn in as president. This past July, a Pew Research Center survey found that about half of respondents believed the best age range for a U.S. president was in the 50s — well below Mr. Biden’s 80 and Donald Trump’s 77.

      A new book reckons with decades of disappointment.
      In the agonized debates over how it can possibly be that Donald Trump has such a strong chance of being returned to the White House in 2024, it’s important to stress the ways in which the Trump economy, before the arrival of Covid, departed in positive ways from the trends of the last half-century. Trump’s presidency was a period not just of steady growth and low unemployment, but also of growth that was more widely shared than in much of the recent past — with the strongest improvement in median incomes since the 1990s, wage growth for middle- and low-income workers outpacing growth for the upper class, and the lowest African American unemployment rate in decades.

      For some, tending to our humble home gardens, dreaming of lush green splendor, is a pastime. For others, it’s a calling.
      My hometown has a gardening store so lavish, so over-the-top curated with weather-stained terra-cotta planters the size of vintners’ casks, crumbling concrete birdbaths rescued from Eden and a jungle’s worth of fronds and boughs and leaves that it is a destination. Out-of-towners come to gaze at its tableaux of mosses, hand-forged shears and fairy lights, to dine on seasonal produce at its in-house cafe. I think there might be an actual waterfall back by the table linens.

The potential reversal highlights the complexities — for both employers and employees — of navigating what has quickly become one of the most emotionally divisive issues in recent decades.

      Celebration of Hamas is both disgusting and self-defeating.
      On Tuesday evening, I was drinking on the porch of my friend and neighbor Misha Shulman, the Israel-born rabbi of a progressive New York synagogue called the New Shul. All day, he’d been on the phone with congregants deeply distraught over the massacres and mass kidnappings in Israel. Of all the people he spoke to, he said, those most devastated were either people who had lost close friends or family, or young Jews “completely shattered by the response of their lefty friends in New York,” who were either justifying Hamas’s atrocities or celebrating them outright.

      I’ve moved back to the United States twice since my birth. Once as a child, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Then again for graduate school. I’d had the privilege of a youth — adolescence and young adulthood — in countries where being Palestinian was fairly common. The identity could be heavy, but it wasn’t a contested one. I hadn’t had to learn the respectability politics of being a Palestinian adult. I learned quickly.

      On a rainy, windy morning in February 2012, on a highway outside of Jerusalem, an 18-wheeler collided with a school bus filled with kindergartners and their teachers. The bus rolled over and landed on its side, door-side down, and burst into flames. One teacher and six children died. Some of the survivors were so badly burned that a local man who broke a window and climbed into the bus to pull the children out couldn’t recognize them as human.

In response, the African National Congress, then in its 77th year of a struggle to overthrow white domination, did something remarkable: It accepted responsibility and pledged to prevent its fighters from conducting such operations in the future. Its logic was straightforward: Targeting civilians is wrong. “Our morality as revolutionaries,” the A.N.C. declared, “dictates that we respect the values underpinning the humane conduct of war.”

      After the murder of hundreds of Israelis, pro-Palestinian demonstrators cheered.
      On Saturday morning in southern Israel, Hamas murdered hundreds of people at a music festival and kidnapped others at gunpoint to serve as human shields in Gaza. On Sunday afternoon in Midtown Manhattan, a speaker at a rally of pro-Palestinian and left-wing groups celebrated that atrocity — one of thousands suffered by Israelis over the past few days, which we later learned included the killing of babies and toddlers.

      Grief over Israel doesn’t mean we can look away from mass death in Gaza.
      Watching from afar as people race toward an abyss, I find it hard to know what to write except “no,” over and over. In the face of massacres that for Jews around the world brought back memories of genocide, the language of some Israeli leaders has, in turn, become murderous. On the cusp of a likely ground invasion of Gaza, many people I’ve spoken to, Jewish and Palestinian alike, are terrified that this rhetoric will become reality.

      Another attack at a school, three years after the beheading of a teacher, has heightened anxiety about a new wave of terrorism in an already scarred country.
      The terrorist attack by Hamas in Israel and the retaliatory strikes in Gaza had already put the French authorities on edge, pushing them to jack up security at Jewish sites and ban pro-Palestinian protests.

      Democrats and Republicans put aside an increasingly partisan divide over Israel to condemn the Hamas attack. But that support may be harder to maintain as Israel retaliates.
      The staggering Hamas surprise attack on Israel has done what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu never could — united America’s fractious politicians behind his nation again. Sort of. Mostly. For now.

      The president has won bipartisan plaudits for his response to the war, and his trip to Israel offers a chance to appear statesmanlike. But anger on the left is growing as Israeli strikes pound Gaza.
      As President Biden visited Tel Aviv on Wednesday to demonstrate American solidarity with Israel amid escalating violence after the deadliest attack it has faced in 50 years, Democratic rifts over the conflict were beginning to tear open, leaving him presiding over a party struggling to resolve where it stands.

      Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier, had been a hostage for five years before Israel and Hamas were seriously willing to work toward his release. That was 2011. I had been pursuing secret back-channel communications with Hamas since a week after he was captured in a cross-border raid and dragged into Gaza. My partner in these secret negotiations was Ghazi Hamad, Hamas’s spokesman who was then also a political adviser to its prime minister.

      The furor over a pro-Palestinian rally in Times Square exposed political divisions that were instantly heightened when Hamas attacked Israel.

      Jewish leaders and voters said they were taken aback to discover that many of their ideological allies saw them as oppressors who deserved blame following the Israel attacks.
      Progressive Jews who have spent years supporting racial equity, gay and transgender rights, abortion rights and other causes on the American left — including opposing Israeli policies in Gaza and the West Bank — are suddenly feeling abandoned by those who they long thought of as allies. This wartime shift represents a fundamental break within a liberal coalition that has long powered the Democratic Party.

      The administration has become more critical of Israel’s response to the Hamas attacks, a shift that U.S. officials attribute to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
      Three days after Hamas terrorists slaughtered more than 1,400 people, President Biden offered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu support in the wake of the vow by Israel’s leader to “avenge this black day” and to turn Hamas hide-outs “into a ruin” from the air and on the ground.

      If you care about Israel, you should be more worried than any other time since 1967. Back then, Israel defeated the armies of three Arab states — Egypt, Syria and Jordan — in what became known as the Six-Day War.

      The war has the potential to become another case study in the strategic difficulties of urban warfare.
      For years, Israeli officials have worried about the threat of Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Still, they viewed a full ground invasion of Gaza to be too dangerous and costly to try. Many Israeli soldiers would die. The widespread killing of Palestinian civilians would damage Israel’s global reputation. The invasion might fail to dismantle Hamas.

Once the White House decided in 2002 to remove Saddam Hussein by force, I cautioned my superiors that there needed to be serious planning for what would follow.

      Invading and depopulating Gaza would be inhumane and a potential violation of international law. The United States must do what it can to halt such actions.
      Israel has ordered more than a million people to leave northern Gaza, presumably to prepare for an imminent ground offensive. Its military strategists appear to be planning the depopulation and reoccupation of at least part of an area home to around 2.3 million people — nearly half of them children — and most of them descended from people driven from their homes before and during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. We must understand that these are human beings at grave risk, not just numbers.

From the hawkish perspective, the argument has been that any such trade-off is overstated or nonexistent — because Russia and China are allies, and when we weaken Russia we weaken both, because the kinds of military equipment necessary to defend Taiwan differ from the kinds we’re sending to Ukraine, because surely America has the resources to fight authoritarianism on two fronts.

      Israel’s latest strikes on Gaza have drawn warnings from aid workers and residents of a humanitarian catastrophe. “We are facing a huge disaster,” said one U.N. official.
      Hospitals crowded with patients are running short on fuel. Fearful residents are racing to U.N.-run schools, seeking shelter from airstrikes. Water and electricity have been cut off, the borders are closed, and even the cemeteries do not have room to accommodate all the newly dead.

      The escalation laid bare the limitations of diplomatic deals between Israel and Arab governments as long as the underlying conflict continues. “We told you so,” a Saudi scholar said.
      When the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco announced that they were establishing relations with Israel in 2020, Emirati officials said the deals were symbols of peace and tolerance, while then President Donald J. Trump declared “the dawn of a new Middle East.”

      “The next step is to move forward, go on the offense,” an Israeli general said, as the country called up more reservists in response to devastating attacks by Palestinian gunmen who killed more than 900 people.
      Israeli troops mostly retook control of towns near the Gaza Strip from Palestinian gunmen on Tuesday, four days after fighters for the militant group Hamas assailed Israeli civilians and soldiers in devastating attacks that killed hundreds, wounded thousands and put the grieving country on the brink of a major military operation.

      The latest from the Israel-Hamas war. Weekday afternoons with Lulu Garcia-Navarro and Times journalists on the ground.
      The Israeli military said today that 240 people were taken hostage during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7. As Israeli forces move closer to Gaza City, families continue to demand that the government prioritize the safety and rescue of their loved ones.

      The Israeli military said on Monday that it had rescued an Israeli soldier who was abducted from an Israeli army base on Oct. 7 and taken to Gaza during the Hamas-led terrorist attacks in Israel.

      Israel said it killed a Hamas leader at a refugee camp, but many other people were wounded and killed, Hamas said. The assault came as fuel, food and water shortages pushed civilians to the brink.
      An airstrike that Israel said was targeting Hamas militants caused widespread damage in a densely populated neighborhood of Gaza on Tuesday. Hamas and hospital officials said numerous people were killed and wounded, as humanitarian organizations warned that the territory’s civilian population was at a breaking point.

      Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel did not describe the ground incursion as an invasion, but it was accompanied by an enormous aerial and artillery bombardment.
      Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised news conference on Saturday that Israel’s forces had entered the Gaza Strip, calling it his country’s “second war of independence” and warning Israelis to expect a “long and difficult” campaign to eradicate Hamas.

      I am watching the Israel-Hamas war and thinking about one of the world leaders I’ve most admired: Manmohan Singh. He was India’s prime minister in late November 2008 when 10 Pakistani jihadist militants from the Lashkar-e-Taiba group, widely believed to be linked to Pakistan’s military intelligence, infiltrated India and killed more than 160 people in Mumbai, including 61 at two luxury hotels.

      The administration has become more critical of Israel’s response to the Hamas attacks, a shift that U.S. officials attribute to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
      Three days after Hamas terrorists slaughtered more than 1,400 people, President Biden offered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu support in the wake of the vow by Israel’s leader to “avenge this black day” and to turn Hamas hide-outs “into a ruin” from the air and on the ground.

      Israel’s invasion of Gaza is proceeding more slowly than expected. That may suit the needs of its allies — and its adversaries, analysts say.
      In the 23 harrowing days since Hamas attacked Israeli civilians and soldiers, Israel’s Western allies have had to perform a delicate balancing act: expressing steadfast support for the country during its darkest hours, while navigating the growing public anger on their streets over the intensifying bombardment of Gaza.

      Representative Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, who joined calls for a cease-fire, has become one of several progressive lawmakers facing new pressure from primary challengers.
      As Congregation Beth Shalom in Pittsburgh observed a special evening of prayer on Oct. 22 for the Israeli captives in Gaza, Representative Summer Lee, the progressive Democrat whose district includes the synagogue, paid her respects. She was late to arrive and could not stay long, but the rabbi, Seth Adelson, called her chief of staff the next day to offer his thanks.

      Fakes related to the conflict have been limited and largely unconvincing, but their presence has people doubting real evidence.
      It was a gruesome image that shot rapidly around the internet: a charred body, described as a deceased child, that was apparently photographed in the opening days of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.

      The Russian authorities announced that the airport in Makhachkala, the capital of the predominantly Muslim Dagestan region, was temporarily closed and riot police were dispatched to the scene.
      A mob stormed an airport in southern Russia where a commercial flight from Tel Aviv had arrived on Sunday night, according to Russian state media and videos posted from the scene. The episode followed several anti-Israel protests in the region that could signal a new point of friction for the Kremlin as it wages a war in Ukraine.

      The response to the Oct. 7 assault, and to Israel’s retaliation, has revealed a schism in the entertainment world that many did not realize was there.
      With the exception of the rare conservative, Hollywood has long seemed to exist in an ideological bubble — a bastion of progressive politics, where Jewish people have thrived, Democratic politicians have been celebrated and stars have espoused liberal ideas from the Oscar stage and rushed to support movements like Black Lives Matter.

      The airstrikes were the latest gamble by the United States to modify Iran’s behavior, few of which have worked in the past.
      The American strikes on two Iranian military munitions stockpiles in Syria on Friday were carefully designed, President Biden’s aides said, to send two distinct messages to Tehran.

      The kingdom is embracing business as usual, hosting an investment forum, concerts and even fashion shows. But grief, fear and outrage over Israel’s bombardment of Gaza simmer just below the surface.
      As the curtain rose this week on an annual investment forum hosted by the Saudi crown prince, dancers in silver bodysuits undulated through the crowd, and a teenage boy in a sequined suit sang an operatic solo while an image of a white dove — a symbol of peace — flew across the screens surrounding the darkened room.

      The president’s “unwavering support” for Israel stems from childhood dinner table conversations and half a century of trips to the Jewish state. But it puts him at odds with some in his own party.
      One morning during a spasm of violence two decades ago, with suicide bombings shattering Israel every other day, the King David Hotel in Jerusalem seemed eerily empty. Foreigners were staying away. Nobody was in the dining room. Except for two people having breakfast: Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his aide, Antony J. Blinken.

      Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to force a stand-alone vote on aid for Israel, peeling off a request from the Biden administration for money from Ukraine and coupling it with spending cuts, has set up a confrontation between the House and Senate over how to fund U.S. allies during the conflicts.

      Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the small group of officials would play a key role in determining when Israel begins a ground invasion of Gaza.
      Before the deadly Hamas attack on Oct. 7, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was running a divisive government widely seen as the most conservative in Israel’s history. Amid anticipation of a protracted campaign to eradicate Hamas, Mr. Netanyahu responded to political pressure and formed a unity government that included opposition leaders.

      Russia is emerging as a major beneficiary of the war in Gaza.
      As Israel and Hamas descend into all-out war, Russia has been more of a bit player than a lead actor. There is no evidence that Moscow directly aided or abetted Hamas’s vicious attack against Israel on Oct. 7, despite some early suggestions. Diplomatically, too, the Kremlin has been of negligible significance, unable to defuse the metastasizing tensions.

      When I spoke with the writer Etgar Keret at home in Tel Aviv earlier this week, he was in anguish. Keret is one of Israel’s most beloved contemporary authors, whose books include “Suddenly, a Knock on the Door” and “The Seven Good Years.” He primarily writes short stories that are whimsical, surrealist and darkly funny, and that make meaning from life’s smallest, most unremarkable interactions.

      As Israel’s war against Hamas has become an animating force in the Republican presidential primary, Gov.

      If you care about Israel, you should be more worried than any other time since 1967. Back then, Israel defeated the armies of three Arab states — Egypt, Syria and Jordan — in what became known as the Six-Day War. Today, if you look closely, you’ll see that Israel is now fighting the Six-Front War.

      This week, a dramatic public battle has been playing out between the United Nations, Israel and the United States. On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council voted down two competing resolutions on the Israel-Hamas war. These votes came one day after Israel called for the U.N. secretary general to resign in response to his comments that the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, while appalling, “cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.”

      For 17 days, Israeli ground troops and tanks have been on standby, idling in the dusty fields around Gaza. Their stated mission: to invade the Palestinian coastal enclave and destroy the military capabilities of Hamas, the armed Islamist group, and its ability to rule there.

      Spencer Ackerman and Peter Beinart navigate the tensions between grief and solidarity in the aftermath of Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack.
      Grief moves slowly, and war moves quickly. After Hamas assailants killed at least 1,400 Israelis and took hundreds more hostage, Israel dropped more than 6,000 bombs on Gaza in the first week of a conflict that is ongoing. So far, more than 5,000 Palestinians are reported dead and many more injured. There’s no one way to cover this that reconciles all that is happening and all that needs to be felt.

      As the Israel-Hamas war continues, its rising civilian death toll has raised more questions about what is allowed under the international laws that govern the waging of war. These rules are remarkably clear in some areas, as I wrote last week, and experts said they had been gravely breached by Hamas in its massacres of civilians and taking of hostages, and by Israel when it announced a complete siege of Gaza that cut off water, food and fuel to over 2 million inhabitants.

      Leagues and teams probably would have preferred not to take a public position on the Israel-Hamas war. That they could not avoid doing so is their own fault.
      By the end of last week, England’s Football Association doubtless felt that it had done the best it could, that after hours and hours of talks, it had settled on what might best be described as the least worst option.

      Jewish leaders and voters said they were taken aback to discover that many of their ideological allies saw them as oppressors who deserved blame following the Israel attacks.
      Progressive Jews who have spent years supporting racial equity, gay and transgender rights, abortion rights and other causes on the American left — including opposing Israeli policies in Gaza and the West Bank — are suddenly feeling abandoned by those who they long thought of as allies. This wartime shift represents a fundamental break within a liberal coalition that has long powered the Democratic Party.

      President Biden promised undying American backing for Israel in its war against Hamas. But that won’t mean U.S. support for everything Israel does.
      In the wake of a visit by President Biden, Israelis on Thursday praised his courage in coming at a time of war and for his full-throated support, as he pledged “we will not let you ever be alone” after attacks from Hamas killed at least 1,400 Israelis.

      President Biden could very well go down in history as the last American president born during World War II and shaped by a view of American power nurtured in the Cold War. No other leader on the world stage today can boast that they sat in the Israeli prime minister’s office 50 years ago with Golda Meir, or discussed dismantling Soviet nuclear weapons with Mikhail Gorbachev.

      President Biden’s presence in Israel — and the message it sent — was more important than any tangible goals he achieved.
      President Biden flew into multiple headwinds on his risky trip to show solidarity with Israel on Wednesday. Even before his plane landed at Ben Gurion Airport, several allied Arab leaders announced they would not see him. He won a limited agreement from Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza but secured no promises that Israel would follow his urgent request to respond to the terrorist attack by Hamas with deliberate care and concern for the preservation of civilian life, rather than rage. He offered a small aid package for residents of Gaza and the West Bank but can’t do much more until Congress functions again.

      Watching from afar as people race toward an abyss, I find it hard to know what to write except “no,” over and over. In the face of massacres that for Jews around the world brought back memories of genocide, the language of some Israeli leaders has, in turn, become murderous. On the cusp of a likely ground invasion of Gaza, many people I’ve spoken to, Jewish and Palestinian alike, are terrified that this rhetoric will become reality.

Like many Jews around the country, much of the weekend passed on the phone with family members, fearing for the safety of friends and extended family in Israel. Andino’s fellow students in Columbae, the social justice and antiwar residential house where she is a residential assistant, held her through her panic attacks. “I felt so powerless,” she recalled when we spoke this week.

      Throughout this horrible week, my mind has repeatedly flashed back to Dec. 23, 2000. That was the day the Palestinians were offered a path to having their own nation on roughly 95 percent of the land in the West Bank and 100 percent of the land in the Gaza Strip. Under that outline, Israel would also swap some of its own land to compensate the Palestinians in exchange for maintaining 80 percent of its settler presence in the West Bank.

      The crisis in the Middle East must be analyzed in terms of great power politics and the pressure we face from broadly aligned rivals.
      Twenty-one years ago, in the shadow of the Sept. 11 attacks, George W. Bush warned of an “axis of evil,” encompassing the authoritarian and anti-American regimes of Iraq, Iran and North Korea. He did not claim that they were actually allies or partners in the style of Nazi Germany and imperial Japan. What made them an axis, in his rhetoric, was simply their ample cruelty, their shared pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their potential willingness to share such weapons with groups like Al Qaeda.

On Sunday afternoon in Midtown Manhattan, a speaker at a rally of pro-Palestinian and left-wing groups celebrated that atrocity — one of thousands suffered by Israelis over the past few days, which we later learned included the killing of babies and toddlers.

      The strategy mirrors efforts by extremist groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda in years past.
      A video of a Hamas gunman firing his assault rifle at a car full of Israeli civilians was viewed more than one million times on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, since it was uploaded Sunday.

      The furor over a pro-Palestinian rally in Times Square exposed political divisions that were instantly heightened when Hamas attacked Israel.
      Hamas’s brutal attack on Israel has upended the political landscape in New York, cracking open fault lines through two of the city’s most important constituencies: a Jewish community that is the second largest in the world and a newly energized leftist movement that has risen to prominence in the city.

      There is broad consensus in Congress for backing Israel in its war against Hamas, but with the House rudderless and divided, the path for any assistance is uncertain.
      Congressional leaders in both parties have pledged to approve emergency military support to Israel for its war against Hamas, but gridlock over federal spending and the Republican leadership crisis engulfing the House have raised questions about how and when such aid could be delivered.

      Israel had considered Hamas a terrorist organization but one that could play a useful role for Israel in the Gaza Strip, which the group controls. Now, senior Israeli officials say, Hamas must be crushed.
      Since its founding, Hamas has declared that Israel has no right to exist, that there are no Israeli civilians and that every Israeli citizen is a soldier of the state, and thus a legitimate target.

      American and Israeli officials said none of Israel’s intelligence services had specific warning that Hamas was preparing a sophisticated assault.
      The devastating surprise attack by Hamas on Saturday represented an equally stunning intelligence failure by Israel that involved undetected warnings, overwhelmed missile defenses and a slow response by apparently unprepared military forces, former and current U.S. officials said.

      The attack by Hamas forces Israel once again to confront the conflict that has haunted it since the creation of the modern state.
      The most sweeping invasion of Israeli territory in decades, conducted by a Hamas force that had been widely seen as a ragtag collection of militants, has delivered a psychological shock to Israel so great that its very foundations are being questioned: its army, its intelligence services, its government and its capacity to control the millions of Palestinians in its midst.

      Sirens sounded across southern and central Israel early Saturday as salvos of rockets hit Israeli cities and gunmen crossed the border from Gaza.
      Fighting continued into the evening on Saturday in one of the broadest invasions of Israeli territory in 50 years, as Palestinian militants from Gaza fired another round of rockets at Israel’s central heartland, including Tel Aviv, and Israel worked to clear militants from Israeli towns and retaliated with huge strikes on Gazan cities.

      On Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas fighters from Gaza rampaged through border towns in a surprise attack that killed at least 1,300 Israelis. Hamas terrorists killed men, women and children, at home, strolling on the street or dancing at an outdoor festival, and they took more than 150 hostages. Now the region is bracing for further conflict.

      The first hotel I ever fell in love with was the Metropole, an old-world gem in Vietnam’s capital, Hanoi. My wife and I stayed there in 2007 on a break from covering the war in Iraq, and between the plush beds, the deep-ended pool in a quiet courtyard, and the rich history of the place as a hub of activity during the Vietnam War, we were smitten.

      Why run? I ask myself this question as I lace up my shoes, as I confront an approaching hill, as I coax one more lap out of my aching calves. The obvious answer is that we run to be healthy, to improve our cardiovascular systems and our moods, to become fitter and stronger. But sometimes it feels like the real reason that I run is to get better at running. I run so that I can run more.

      Israel’s invasion of Gaza is proceeding more slowly than expected. That may suit the needs of its allies — and its adversaries, analysts say.
      In the 23 harrowing days since Hamas attacked Israeli civilians and soldiers, Israel’s Western allies have had to perform a delicate balancing act: expressing steadfast support for the country during its darkest hours, while navigating the growing public anger on their streets over the intensifying bombardment of Gaza.

      The initial decision to undertake limited ground incursions rather than a full-scale invasion appears to follow guidance from top U.S. military officials.
      Israel’s apparent decision to hold off on a full-scale invasion of the Gaza Strip and instead conduct more limited ground incursions, at least initially, aligns with suggestions that the U.S. defense secretary, Lloyd J.

      Israel said it killed a Hamas leader at a refugee camp, but many other people were wounded and killed, Hamas said. The assault came as fuel, food and water shortages pushed civilians to the brink.
      An airstrike that Israel said was targeting Hamas militants caused widespread damage in a densely populated neighborhood of Gaza on Tuesday. Hamas and hospital officials said numerous people were killed and wounded, as humanitarian organizations warned that the territory’s civilian population was at a breaking point.

      Palestinian militants from Gaza launched an early-morning assault on southern Israel, invading towns and firing thousands of rockets. Israel retaliated with huge strikes on Gazan cities.
      Israel battled on Saturday to repel one of the broadest invasions of its territory in 50 years after Palestinian militants from Gaza launched an early-morning assault on southern Israel, infiltrating 22 Israeli towns and army bases, kidnapping Israeli civilians and soldiers and firing thousands of rockets toward cities as far away as Jerusalem.

      President Biden’s top aides scrambled on Sunday to reaffirm their commitment to the idea of potential normalization of diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel, even as Israel prepares for the start of a full-scale war against Palestinian militants.

      The country has said there are two main goals in the war: Destroy Hamas and free the hostages held in Gaza. But are those goals compatible?
      As terrified families of hostages abducted by Hamas hold tense vigils, voicing fears that Israel’s ground attacks in Gaza could take the lives of their loved ones, the country got a rare bit of good news on Monday: Israeli soldiers had secretly rescued a 19-year-old woman.

      After an air campaign that killed thousands of Palestinians, Israel has begun a ground assault, but it took hours for outside observers to understand what was happening. The ambiguity was intentional.
      When Israeli ground forces advanced en masse into the Gaza Strip on Friday evening, just after the Jewish Sabbath began, they did it so secretly that it was hours before the outside world understood what had happened.

      The administration has become more critical of Israel’s response to the Hamas attacks, a shift that U.S. officials attribute to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
      Three days after Hamas terrorists slaughtered more than 1,400 people, President Biden offered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu support in the wake of the vow by Israel’s leader to “avenge this black day” and to turn Hamas hide-outs “into a ruin” from the air and on the ground.

      Israel has every right to defend itself and fight terrorists. But is this really the best way?
      The most consequential decision Israel will face in the coming days is how hard to continue hitting Gaza. Should it undertake a monthslong ground invasion? Continue with large-scale aerial bombardment? Allow fuel into Gaza to keep hospitals running?

      The Brothers in Arms group helped lead protests against the government, with members vowing to ignore military call-ups. But after the Hamas attacks, it pivoted to aid those affected by the conflict.
      Made up largely of veterans and reservists, the group that calls itself Brothers in Arms started nine months ago as a protest movement against the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It helped to organize giant weekly demonstrations against his plans to give the government unprecedented control over the judiciary. And many of its members vowed that they would not serve in the army if called.

On Oct. 17, following the explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, we were flooded with dozens of wounded and dying victims. By the next day, our patient roster had grown by nearly 120. We knew it would be another sleepless night, another in a string of far too many since the violence started 10 days earlier.

      The New York Times on Monday published an editors’ note about its coverage of an explosion on Oct. 17 at a hospital in Gaza City. The initial report, which included a large headline across The Times’s website, led with claims by Hamas government officials that the explosion was caused by an Israeli airstrike.

      Israel’s military struck hundreds of targets in Gaza on Monday, in one of the biggest barrages yet of its war with Hamas and as a trickle of aid arrived for desperate Palestinians in the strip, where the lack of clean water, medicine and other critical supplies is fueling a dire humanitarian crisis.

      The Middle East could be on the verge of a regional conflagration.

      Why the U.S. wants Israel to pause a ground invasion in Gaza.
      For more than a week, an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza has seemed as if it might begin any day. Troops and tanks have crowded the border. Israel has ordered Gazans to evacuate south. The military has showered missiles on Hamas bunkers to weaken the group.

      Violence on Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, and strikes in Syria and the West Bank, sent shock waves through the Middle East.
      As Israeli forces massed along the border with Gaza on Sunday ahead of an expected ground invasion, escalating clashes on Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, as well as strikes in Syria and in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, intensified fears of a widening regional conflict.

      I have been in touch with leaders of both sides. Prospects remain dim.
      Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier, had been a hostage for five years before Israel and Hamas were seriously willing to work toward his release. That was 2011. I had been pursuing secret back-channel communications with Hamas since a week after he was captured in a cross-border raid and dragged into Gaza. My partner in these secret negotiations was Ghazi Hamad, Hamas’s spokesman who was then also a political adviser to its prime minister.

      Two days after President Biden said he had secured Israel’s agreement to allow food, water and medicine into the besieged Gaza Strip, and a day after aid groups were told their trucks would cross the border on Friday, nothing budged, as the powers involved continued to haggle over the details, while conditions within Gaza grew more dire.

      Amid the sorrow and anger over the ongoing violence, the core principles of humanitarian law are simple. Civilians must be protected.
      As the Israel-Hamas war continues, its rising civilian death toll has raised more questions about what is allowed under the international laws that govern the waging of war. These rules are remarkably clear in some areas, as I wrote last week, and experts said they had been gravely breached by Hamas in its massacres of civilians and taking of hostages, and by Israel when it announced a complete siege of Gaza that cut off water, food and fuel to over 2 million inhabitants.

      The deadly tribalism of the Middle East meets the dreary tribalism of American politics.
      The barbaric killings of unsuspecting civilians in Israel on Oct. 7 and the current devastation of Palestinians in Gaza are all President Biden’s fault. Haven’t you read? He went soft on Iran. He’s soft, period. He has exposed the United States as something even flimsier than a paper tiger — we’re a Kleenex pussycat.

      With a ground invasion into Gaza imminent, Israelis are grappling with a total breakdown of trust and a collapse of everything they believed in and relied on.
      On the ninth day after Hamas overran more than 20 Israeli pastoral communities and army bases, killing more than 1,300 people and taking 150 hostages back to Gaza, Israel was a country on edge.

      Diplomats from the U.S., Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries were locked in frantic talks yesterday to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Clashes along Israel’s border with Lebanon and Israeli airstrikes inside Syria stoked fears of a wider conflict in the region.

      Hundreds of people injured in Israeli airstrikes are streaming into hospitals in Gaza, transported by overfilled ambulances and sharing bloodied gurneys at the entrances. Workers and bystanders rush to carry the victims inside, where only the most critically wounded are allowed to stay, and the rest are sent home.

      Israel is about to embark on a military task that will try its soul.
      As Israeli soldiers mass outside the Gaza Strip, preparing to launch a ground invasion that could lead to extraordinarily intense urban combat, there is a community of people who know what these soldiers are about to face. And that community knows that there is no way through the fight without sorrow, confusion and terrible heartbreak.

      Invading and depopulating Gaza would be inhumane and a potential violation of international law. The United States must do what it can to halt such actions.
      Israel has ordered more than a million people to leave northern Gaza, presumably to prepare for an imminent ground offensive. Its military strategists appear to be planning the depopulation and reoccupation of at least part of an area home to around 2.3 million people — nearly half of them children — and most of them descended from people driven from their homes before and during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. We must understand that these are human beings at grave risk, not just numbers.

      It can succeed only by upholding the rules and norms of behavior that Hamas wantonly ignores.
      Israel stands on the verge of invading Gaza in response to the terrorist attacks by Hamas that many, including Israel’s leaders, have compared to Sept. 11 not just because of the scale and savagery but also because the terrorists sought to destroy the tranquillity of daily life. They killed the very young and the very old, the strong and the weak, civilians and soldiers; they took some 150 hostages, including children, and survivors said the attackers raped women — all to send a message that no Israeli was safe.

      Killing civilians doesn’t end extremism. It feeds it.
      On a reporting trip to Gaza two decades ago, I interrupted some high school boys playing soccer and asked them about their lives and hopes. The conversation veered to Israel and terrorism, so I quizzed them about whether they believed it would be morally acceptable for a Palestinian to bomb a group of Israeli women.

      Ethical resistance is the answer to grief and rage.
      In 1988, bombs exploded at restaurants, sporting events and arcades in South Africa. In response, the African National Congress, then in its 77th year of a struggle to overthrow white domination, did something remarkable: It accepted responsibility and pledged to prevent its fighters from conducting such operations in the future. Its logic was straightforward: Targeting civilians is wrong. “Our morality as revolutionaries,” the A.N.C. declared, “dictates that we respect the values underpinning the humane conduct of war.”

      With the Middle East on the cusp of a full-blown ground war, I was thinking on Friday morning about how Israel’s last two major wars have two very important things in common: They were both started by nonstate actors backed by Iran — Hezbollah from Lebanon in 2006 and Hamas from Gaza now — after Israel had withdrawn from their territories.

      The president’s experience should lead him to counsel Israel to exercise restraint. Will he?
      President Biden’s experience certainly should have prepared him for this moment of crisis in Israel and Palestine. He began his national political career with a run for the Senate in 1972 that turned on his pledge to fight the Nixon administration’s escalation of the Vietnam War. He opposed that war less on moral grounds than on pragmatic ones: that the war was futile and needlessly drained American resources and power.

      Twenty-one years ago, in the shadow of the Sept. 11 attacks, George W. Bush warned of an “axis of evil,” encompassing the authoritarian and anti-American regimes of Iraq, Iran and North Korea. He did not claim that they were actually allies or partners in the style of Nazi Germany and imperial Japan. What made them an axis, in his rhetoric, was simply their ample cruelty, their shared pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their potential willingness to share such weapons with groups like Al Qaeda.

      The Islamist militant group that controls Gaza has taken its attacks on Israel to a new level, building on decades of hostilities.
      Hamas, an armed Palestinian group, launched one of the largest assaults on Israel in decades on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, taking more than 220 hostages and leading Israel to declare war. The largest of the armed Islamist groups in the Gaza Strip, Hamas governs that Palestinian territory, home to two million people.

      On Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas fighters from Gaza rampaged through border towns in a surprise attack that killed at least 1,300 Israelis. Hamas terrorists killed men, women and children, at home, strolling on the street or dancing at an outdoor festival, and they took more than 150 hostages. Now the region is bracing for further conflict.

      Also, America’s deficit doubled. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday.
      Hamas released an American mother and daughter who were kidnapped by the Palestinian group during its deadly Oct. 7 attack and held hostage for almost two weeks in Gaza. The Israeli military received them at the border and took them to an army base in central Israel to be reunited with family members.

      Rising domestic pressures and a desire to boost its anti-Israel credentials pushed Hamas to attack and most likely drove its decision to inflict terror.
      The day Israelis woke to the horror that the Palestinian squads that had infiltrated their country were shooting soldiers and civilians and dragging captives back to Gaza, the shadowy commander of Hamas’s military wing released a rare message blessing the attack.

      The war has the potential to become another case study in the strategic difficulties of urban warfare.
      For years, Israeli officials have worried about the threat of Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Still, they viewed a full ground invasion of Gaza to be too dangerous and costly to try. Many Israeli soldiers would die. The widespread killing of Palestinian civilians would damage Israel’s global reputation. The invasion might fail to dismantle Hamas.

      A surprise attack by Hamas put Israel and the militants who control Gaza at war. Here are images from the assault and what has followed.
      A brief respite in the fighting began in Gaza on Friday after seven weeks of devastating war. As part of the truce agreement, Hamas released two dozen hostages it had been holding in the enclave, and Israel released nearly 40 imprisoned Palestinians. It was the most significant diplomatic breakthrough since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks on Israel prompted a full-blown war.

      The Times’s initial accounts of the blast attributed the claim of Israeli responsibility to Palestinian officials, and noted that the Israeli military said it was investigating the blast. However, the early versions of the coverage relied too heavily on claims by Hamas.
      On Oct. 17, The New York Times published news of an explosion at a hospital in Gaza City, leading its coverage with claims by Hamas government officials that an Israeli airstrike was the cause and that hundreds of people were dead or injured. The report included a large headline at the top of The Times’s website.

      As President Biden visited Tel Aviv on Wednesday to demonstrate American solidarity with Israel amid escalating violence after the deadliest attack it has faced in 50 years, Democratic rifts over the conflict were beginning to tear open, leaving him presiding over a party struggling to resolve where it stands.

      You don’t have to take a side to recognize terrorism.
      Alma Andino, a Jewish senior at Stanford University, spent the day of Hamas’s attacks against Israel crying and distraught. Like many Jews around the country, much of the weekend passed on the phone with family members, fearing for the safety of friends and extended family in Israel. Andino’s fellow students in Columbae, the social justice and antiwar residential house where she is a residential assistant, held her through her panic attacks. “I felt so powerless,” she recalled when we spoke this week.

      Demolishing Hamas’s terrorist capacities requires demolishing its capacity to rule in Gaza, and someone has to rule in Gaza.
      If you compare the massacres carried out by Hamas in Israel with the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as many observers have in recent days, you are offering Israel a tacit warning: Don’t repeat the kind of blunders that pervaded American policymaking after the trauma of Sept. 11.

      Spencer Ackerman and Peter Beinart navigate the tensions between grief and solidarity in the aftermath of Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack.
      Grief moves slowly, and war moves quickly. After Hamas assailants killed at least 1,400 Israelis and took hundreds more hostage, Israel dropped more than 6,000 bombs on Gaza in the first week of a conflict that is ongoing. So far, more than 5,000 Palestinians are reported dead and many more injured. There’s no one way to cover this that reconciles all that is happening and all that needs to be felt.

There’s a debate over how much, if any, of the money should come from special allotments that were made earlier this year to the ultra-Orthodox and to settlers in the West Bank.

He won a limited agreement from Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza but secured no promises that Israel would follow his urgent request to respond to the terrorist attack by Hamas with deliberate care and concern for the preservation of civilian life, rather than rage.

      Social media is full of false and misleading posts. The rise in A.I. is making it worse. And the trust in traditional news sources has declined.
      The major social media platforms, once heralded for their ability to document global events in real time, face a crisis of authenticity — one of their own making, critics say.

      Israel is a small country. Everyone I know knows somebody who was killed or affected by the excruciating events of the past week. In my case, it is a family friend from our synagogue, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a dual American Israeli citizen, who was at the outdoor music festival that was ambushed by Hamas. Hundreds of people were murdered at the festival; some were taken hostage. Hersh was most likely one of them.

      The organizers of the Frankfurt Book Fair are demonizing a fiction writer and stifling her viewpoint.
      Last week the literary association Litprom canceled a celebration for the Palestinian author Adania Shibli’s book “Minor Detail” at the Frankfurt Book Fair, one of the publishing world’s biggest international book fairs. The novel, which was a finalist for the National Book Award and was longlisted for the International Booker Prize, was to be honored for having won the 2023 LiBeraturpreis, a German literary prize awarded annually to a woman from the developing world. A panel that Shibli, who splits her time between Jerusalem and Berlin, was to be on with her German translator, Günther Orth, was likewise canceled.

      Throughout this horrible week, my mind has repeatedly flashed back to Dec. 23, 2000. That was the day the Palestinians were offered a path to having their own nation on roughly 95 percent of the land in the West Bank and 100 percent of the land in the Gaza Strip. Under that outline, Israel would also swap some of its own land to compensate the Palestinians in exchange for maintaining 80 percent of its settler presence in the West Bank.

But today countless people are plugged into a frantically churning news cycle, trying to instantly metabolize a conflict that is a hall of mirrors in the best of times and is now careening toward a possible regional war, with all the propaganda and mass panic that entails. It’s an epistemological catastrophe that is putting people’s lives in danger.

      Representative Mike Johnson’s election as speaker has thrown the fate of U.S. assistance for Ukraine into doubt, as the Louisiana Republican, a longtime opponent of funding the war effort, resists President Biden’s call to package money for Kyiv in a large emergency spending bill to tackle global crises including Israel’s war against Hamas.

      An address by President Biden.
      In a prime-time address last night, President Biden sought to convey to Americans what is at stake as wars rage in the Middle East and Ukraine, before his expected request to Congress for $14 billion in emergency assistance for Israel and $60 billion for Ukraine. He argued that providing the aid was in the interest of global stability and the national security of the U.S.

      The House is deadlocked at a time of international chaos. There are paths forward for Patrick McHenry as a more permanent interim speaker.
      In the first nearly 10 months of their majority, Republicans have nominated three different people to serve as speaker of the House, and not one of them currently holds the gavel. Jim Jordan’s defeat at the hands of mainly centrists, following the demise of Steve Scalise and Kevin McCarthy at the hands of conservatives, cements the idea that there may be no person who can unify the Republican conference.

Trump’s presidency was a period not just of steady growth and low unemployment, but also of growth that was more widely shared than in much of the recent past — with the strongest improvement in median incomes since the 1990s, wage growth for middle- and low-income workers outpacing growth for the upper class, and the lowest African American unemployment rate in decades.
