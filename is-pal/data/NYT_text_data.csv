0,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/world/middleeast/israel-ground-operation.html,"In the 23 harrowing days since Hamas attacked Israeli civilians and soldiers, Israel’s Western allies have had to perform a delicate balancing act: expressing steadfast support for the country during its darkest hours, while navigating the growing public anger on their streets over the intensifying bombardment of Gaza.

Israel’s neighbors in the Middle East have walked a different tightrope: managing outraged populations and, in some cases, proxy militant groups, which threaten to drag them into a broader war with Israel that they may not seek.

For both, Israel’s unfolding ground invasion of the densely populated Gaza Strip has complicated their calculations.

The phased nature of the operation has lacked the thunderous impact of an all-out infantry and tank assault, something Israel’s rivals had warned against, given the likelihood that it would cause untold civilian casualties. And yet the growing Palestinian death toll — more than 8,000, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry — and the prospect that the fighting might go on for months, has already drawn thousands of protesters into the streets from London to Istanbul, demanding a cease-fire."
1,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-ground-invasion.html,"Israel’s apparent decision to hold off on a full-scale invasion of the Gaza Strip and instead conduct more limited ground incursions, at least initially, aligns with suggestions that the U.S. defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, made to his Israeli counterparts in recent days, American officials said on Saturday.

Biden administration officials warned that it was hard to tell what Israel would eventually do, since increased airstrikes and expanded ground incursions in the past three days indicated a more aggressive posture.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Saturday evening that Israeli forces had entered the Gaza Strip on Friday to begin “the second stage of the war,” though he did not describe the move as an invasion. Military officials said earlier on Saturday that Israeli troops had pushed into the northern part of the enclave and remained there on Saturday evening.

So far, the incursions into Gaza by Israeli ground forces are smaller and more narrowly focused than what Israeli military officials initially described to Mr. Austin and other top U.S. military officials, American officials said on Saturday.

Indeed, the initial Israeli invasion plans alarmed U.S. officials, who expressed concern that they lacked achievable military objectives and that the Israeli military was not yet ready to launch a ground invasion.

In phone conversations with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, Mr. Austin has stressed the need for careful consideration of how Israeli forces might conduct a ground invasion of Gaza, where Hamas maintains an intricate network of tunnels under densely populated areas.

The Israelis improved and refined their plan after a concerted effort by Mr. Austin and other officials, a U.S. official said on Saturday, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe war planning between allies. However, Biden administration officials have insisted that the United States had not told Israel what to do and still supports a ground invasion.

Other factors that also most likely influenced Israel’s war planning, American officials say, are the possible impact on hostage negotiations and the fact that Israeli political and military leaders have been divided about how, when and even whether to invade.

But current and former Pentagon officials, as well as former U.S. commanders who have conducted urban military operations, said on Saturday that Israel appeared to be conducting a phased operation, with smaller reconnaissance units advancing into Gaza to locate Hamas fighters, clash with them and identify their vulnerabilities.

“Once the weaknesses, seams and gaps are discovered, they bring in the main assault force,” said Mick Mulroy, a former top Middle East policy official at the Pentagon and a retired C.I.A. officer.

Frederick B. Hodges, a retired three-star Army general who served in Iraq, said the tactic also seemed to be a way for Israeli forces “to reduce or limit casualties as well as collateral damage” to buildings."
2,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/us/politics/us-hostages-israel-gaza.html,"The Biden administration has advised Israel to delay a ground invasion of Gaza, hoping to buy time for hostage negotiations and to allow more humanitarian aid to reach Palestinians in the sealed-off enclave, according to several U.S. officials.

American officials also want more time to prepare for attacks on U.S. interests in the region from Iran-backed groups, which officials said are likely to intensify once Israel moves its forces fully into Gaza.

The administration is not making a demand of Israel and still supports the ground invasion and Israel’s goal of eradicating Hamas, the group controlling Gaza that killed about 1,400 people in terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, the officials said.

But fast-moving events since Hamas released two American women on Friday have spurred the administration to more urgently suggest that the Israelis allow time to negotiate the release of 212 other hostages, the officials said.

President Biden called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday afternoon to discuss the latest developments, the White House said. Mr. Biden also spoke to the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Britain.

Mr. Biden and Mr. Netanyahu agreed that after the entry of the first two convoys of humanitarian aid into Gaza on Saturday, there “will now be continued flow of this critical assistance,” a White House summary of the call said. The leaders also “discussed ongoing efforts to secure the release of all the remaining hostages taken by Hamas — including U.S. citizens — and to provide for safe passage for U.S. citizens and other civilians in Gaza who wish to depart,” the White House said."
3,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/world/middleeast/israel-intelligence-hamas-attack.html,"Israeli officials have promised a full investigation into what went wrong.

Even before that inquiry, it is clear the attacks were possible because of a cascade of failures over recent years — not hours, days or weeks. A New York Times examination, based on dozens of interviews with Israeli, Arab, European and American officials, as well as a review of Israeli government documents and evidence collected since the Oct. 7 raid, shows that:

Israeli security officials spent months trying to warn Mr. Netanyahu that the political turmoil caused by his domestic policies was weakening the country’s security and emboldening Israel’s enemies. The prime minister continued to push those policies. On one day in July he even refused to meet a senior general who came to deliver a threat warning based on classified intelligence, according to Israeli officials.

Israeli officials misjudged the threat posed by Hamas for years, and more critically in the run-up to the attack. The official assessment of Israeli military intelligence and the National Security Council since May 2021 was that Hamas had no interest in launching an attack from Gaza that might invite a devastating response from Israel, according to five people familiar with the assessments who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details. Instead, Israeli intelligence assessed that Hamas was trying to foment violence against Israelis in the West Bank, which is controlled by its rival, the Palestinian Authority.

The belief by Mr. Netanyahu and top Israeli security officials that Iran and Hezbollah, its most powerful proxy force, presented the gravest threat to Israel diverted attention and resources away from countering Hamas. In late September, senior Israeli officials told The Times they were concerned that Israel might be attacked in the coming weeks or months on several fronts by Iran-backed militia groups, but made no mention of Hamas initiating a war with Israel from the Gaza Strip.

American spy agencies in recent years had largely stopped collecting intelligence on Hamas and its plans, believing the group was a regional threat that Israel was managing.

Overall, arrogance among Israeli political and security officials convinced them that the country’s military and technological superiority to Hamas would keep the terrorist group in check.

“They were able to trick our collection, our analysis, our conclusions and our strategic understanding,” Eyal Hulata, Israel’s national security adviser from 2021 until early this year, said during a discussion last week in Washington sponsored by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank.

“I don’t think there was anyone who was involved with affairs with Gaza that shouldn’t ask themselves how and where they were also part of this massive failure,” he added.

Many senior officials have accepted responsibility, but Mr. Netanyahu has not. At 1 a.m. Sunday in Israel, after his office was asked for comment on this article, he posted a message on X, formerly Twitter, that repeated remarks he made to The New York Times and blamed the military and intelligence services for failing to provide him with any warning on Hamas.

“Under no circumstances and at no stage was Prime Minister Netanyahu warned of war intentions on the part of Hamas,” the post read in Hebrew. “On the contrary, the assessment of the entire security echelon, including the head of military intelligence and the head of Shin Bet, was that Hamas was deterred and was seeking an arrangement.”

In the resulting furor, Benny Gantz, a member of his war cabinet, publicly rebuked Mr. Netanyahu, saying that “leadership means displaying responsibility,” and urged the prime minister to retract the post. It was later deleted, and Mr. Netanyahu apologized in a new one.

On Sunday, Shin Bet promised a thorough investigation after the war. The I.D.F. declined to comment.

The last time Israelis’ collective belief in their country’s security was similarly devastated was 50 years earlier, at the start of the Yom Kippur War, when Israel was caught off guard by an assault by Egyptian and Syrian forces. In an echo of that attack, Hamas succeeded because Israeli officials made many of the same mistakes that were made in 1973.

The Yom Kippur War was “a classic example of how intelligence fails when the policy and intelligence communities build a feedback loop that reinforces their prejudices and blinds them to changes in the threat environment,” Bruce Riedel, a former top Middle East analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency, wrote in a 2017 research paper about the 1973 war.

In an interview this month, Mr. Riedel said that Mr. Netanyahu was reaping the consequences of focusing on Iran as the existential threat to Israel while largely ignoring an enemy in his backyard.

“Bibi’s message to Israelis has been that the real threat is Iran,” he said, using Mr. Netanyahu’s nickname. “That with the occupation of the West Bank and the siege of Gaza, the Palestinian issue is no longer a threat to Israel’s security. All of those assumptions were shattered on Oct. 7.”"
4,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/us/politics/biden-israel-trip.html,"The rapidly changing events of the day and the anger that followed demonstrate the perils of a trip by the president less than two weeks after sweeping massacres by Hamas in Israel prompted a new war. With his visit, Mr. Biden was intending to show solidarity with America’s closest ally in the Middle East and urge Israel to avoid civilian casualties. He had also planned to travel onward to Jordan to stress to leaders of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority the risks of the crisis expanding beyond Gaza.

But after Tuesday’s explosion, key parts of the plan began unraveling.

As Air Force One sat on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, White House officials told reporters that the summit in Jordan planned for Wednesday had been canceled. For a moment, it was unclear to reporters and some administration officials aboard the plane whether it would take off to the Middle East at all. Mr. Biden had boarded without answering questions.

Eventually, Air Force One departed, carrying an American president bound for Tel Aviv at a moment when Gaza was facing a humanitarian catastrophe and anger was reverberating across the Middle East.

“The timing and optics of such a significant visit couldn’t be any worse,” said Charles Lister, the director of counterterrorism at the Middle East Institute. “Whatever the circumstances behind this strike at the hospital in Gaza, it doesn’t really matter at this point. The tensions have been inflamed beyond anything we’ve seen over the last week.”

Still, White House officials stressed that Mr. Biden’s trip was still worth making.

John F. Kirby, a spokesman for the White House, said that Mr. Biden had spoken with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before leaving for Israel. Mr. Kirby did not say whether Mr. Netanyahu directly denied responsibility for the explosion, but said that “I think we certainly recognize that they feel very strongly that this was not caused by them.”"
5,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/us/politics/biden-israel-trip.html,"While Mr. Biden and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken have backed the overthrow of Hamas, they have also stressed to Mr. Netanyahu’s government that once Israel is seen blowing up buildings and triggering Palestinian casualties, public sentiment around the world could change dramatically. It would focus less on the Oct. 7 terrorist attack, with its scenes of burned bodies and massacred children, and more on the brutality of the response.

“We obviously don’t want to see any additional civilian suffering,” Mr. Kirby said, though he added that there were no conditions being put on the arms and other aid being shipped to Israel.

Before the announcement, two administration officials, noting the pro-Palestinian marches in Europe, in New York and on some American college campuses, said in interviews that they could already sense the narrative shifting. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the administration’s internal assessments.

Mr. Biden’s visit is an extraordinary show of support to Israel in the midst of war, akin to Mr. Biden’s brief trip to Ukraine in February to shore up international support for President Volodymyr Zelensky. And just as Mr. Biden’s trip to Kyiv came as Ukraine was on the cusp of a major military operation, the visit to Jerusalem comes as hundreds of thousands of Israeli troops are poised to fight their way through the jammed urban landscape of Gaza to carry out Mr. Netanyahu’s vow to eliminate Hamas.

The security risk of such a trip was clear on Monday when sirens warning of incoming rockets or missiles went off while Mr. Blinken, who was in Israel for his second visit in a week, was meeting at a military base with Mr. Netanyahu and his war cabinet. Mr. Blinken and his hosts were rushed to a bunker and sheltered there for five minutes before resuming their discussions. (There was a similar warning when Mr. Biden was touring a few blocks of Kyiv with Mr. Zelensky in February.)"
6,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/us/politics/hospital-gaza-us-intelligence.html,"American and Israeli officials said their intelligence showed that the deadly blast at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday was caused by an armed Palestinian group, rebutting Palestinian claims that an Israeli strike caused the explosion.

The U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive information, said they were basing their early analysis on multiple strands of intelligence indicating that the blast at Ahli Arab hospital was caused by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a group allied with Hamas. The group said Israel’s accusations that one of its rockets malfunctioned and hit the hospital were “false and baseless.” Hamas has not provided any documentation of Israeli involvement.

The officials cautioned that the analysis was preliminary and that they were continuing to collect and analyze evidence. Neither side’s claims about who was responsible have been independently verified.

The American intelligence, first mentioned by President Biden, includes satellite and other infrared data showing a launch of a rocket or missile from Palestinian fighter positions within Gaza. American intelligence agencies have also analyzed open-source video — recordings collected by journalists and others — of the launch showing that it did not come from the direction of Israeli military positions, the officials said. Israeli officials have also provided the United States with intercepts of Hamas officials saying the strike came from forces aligned with Palestinian militant groups.

“The U.S. government assesses that Israel was not responsible for an explosion that killed hundreds of civilians yesterday at the Al Ahli Hospital in the Gaza Strip,” said Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council. “Our assessment is based on available reporting, including intelligence, missile activity and open-source video and images of the incident.”

Ms. Watson said the intelligence indicated that some Palestinian fighters in the Gaza Strip believed the explosion was likely caused by an errant rocket or missile launch carried out by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. “The militants were still investigating what had happened. We continue to work to corroborate whether the explosion resulted from a failed P.I.J. rocket,” she said.

U.S. officials cautioned, however, that the full story of what happened at the hospital is not known. While they do not believe an Israeli strike caused the attack, they are uncertain about how an errant Palestinian rocket could have caused so much loss of life at the hospital.

The main hospital building did not sustain critical damage. While there was light damage to the roofs of the two buildings near the main building, both structures remain intact. It is possible that a rocket hit a parking lot near the hospital where people were gathered, but American officials are trying to learn more.

The efforts by U.S. and Israeli officials to explain their findings came as protests over the Gaza hospital explosion spread across the Middle East, bringing defiant crowds to embassies and consulates of countries that demonstrators said were complicit in the humanitarian crisis.

Multiple officials said the evidence gathered so far refuted claims that Israeli forces were responsible for the blast, and it was strong enough for Mr. Biden to make comments supporting Israel’s account of events.

“Based on what I’ve seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you,” Mr. Biden told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel during a joint appearance on his rare wartime visit to Israel. Mr. Biden said later that he had based his comments on an American military evaluation.

A senior Defense Department official said based on the launch data collected by infrared sensors that the United States was “fairly confident” the launch did not come from Israeli forces.

The Israel Defense Forces said its finding that a malfunctioning rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad had caused the blast came after a review of evidence. The group has denied the claim, and the Hamas-run Gazan health ministry said that an Israeli strike caused the blast, which it said killed hundreds of Palestinians. (The death toll could not be independently confirmed, though video footage verified by The New York Times showed scores of bodies in the hospital’s courtyard, suggesting the number of victims was high.)

In a press briefing on Wednesday morning, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, said that Islamic Jihad fired 10 rockets at 6:59 p.m. local time. One of the rockets, he said, fell to earth prematurely, hitting a parking lot outside the hospital. He said that Israel had not fired any ordnance in the area of the hospital at that time.

He cited a photograph of the parking lot that was posted on social media on Wednesday morning that he said did not show the kind of impact that would have been caused by an Israeli missile. The New York Times has not verified the photo. The photo shows the effects of a fire — burned-out cars and scorched ground. Admiral Hagari said that the damage was caused by rocket fuel that caught fire after hitting the ground.

He also showed aerial footage that he said was taken from a military drone overnight. In the images, he said, there was no evidence of a crater caused by an Israeli missile.

And he dismissed suggestions that the strike was caused by an errant Israeli air defense interceptor. He said Israel does not fire air defense missiles into Gazan airspace.

On Tuesday, Israeli officials provided American intelligence agencies with the intercepted communications.

U.S. officials said their assessment was not based only on the Israeli intercepts. American officials spent the night analyzing those intercepts along with the open-source data, videos captured by journalists and others that show a rocket flying in the vicinity of the hospital.

Senators Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who lead the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Wednesday that the committee had reviewed the intelligence and also attributed the blast to a failed Palestinian rocket launch.

The United States regularly uses infrared satellite collection to analyze launches. The warning system was one of the first pieces of intelligence that showed that a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down by Russian forces over Ukraine in 2014."
7,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/world/asia/china-israel-hamas-antisemitism.html,"Hu Xijin, an influential commentator and a former editor in chief of Global Times, a Communist Party newspaper, responded to hawkish statements from an Israeli minister directed at Hezbollah, the powerful militia in Lebanon, writing on Chinese social media: “Oh, calm down, Israel. I’m worried you’ll wipe the Earth out of the solar system.”

At times, the anti-Israel comments took on a nationalist tone. In a widely viewed post, an influencer with 2.9 million followers on the Chinese social media platform Weibo said that he would opt to call Hamas a “resistance organization” instead of a “terrorist organization,” in keeping with China’s own labeling of the group. He went on to accuse Israel of being a terror organization because its airstrikes on Gaza had caused civilian casualties.

A Chinese state broadcaster recently hosted a discussion page on Weibo stating that Jews controlled a disproportionate amount of U.S. wealth. Many of the responses were replete with antisemitic stereotypes and comments downplaying the horrors of the Holocaust.

Shen Yi, a prominent professor of international relations at Fudan University, likened Israel’s attacks to acts of aggression perpetrated by Nazis. Among the comments on recent posts from the official social media account of Israel’s embassy in China were similar comparisons of Israelis to Nazis.

It is hard to say whether the anti-Israeli positions in state media and antisemitism on the Chinese internet are part of a coordinated campaign. But China’s state media rarely veers from the official position of the country’s Communist Party, and its hair-trigger internet censors are keenly attuned to the wishes of its leaders, quick to remove any content that sways public sentiment in an unwanted direction, especially on matters of such geopolitical importance.

After the family member of an Israeli diplomat was stabbed in Beijing this month, Chinese censors limited the spread of the news by restricting hashtags from search results on social media. Chinese police said the victim was stabbed by a foreign man. It was not clear why the restrictions were put in place.

“If China felt that it was dangerous and problematic to allow antisemitic comments to flourish, the censors would stop it. Clearly, the government is conveying the message that it’s tolerated,” said Carice Witte, the executive director of SIGNAL Group, an Israeli think tank focusing on China."
8,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/us/politics/biden-israel-trip.html,"Never mind that the teeny, tiny font of the advice on the notecard would be awfully hard to read at the moment we thought a rocket was shooting our way. But it was the first time since I started covering the White House in 1996 that I could remember such a briefing for reporters on Air Force One, a sign of just how uncertain the trip could be.

After all, they were bringing the president and his traveling party into a country at war in broad daylight on live television. Air Force One was to land at Ben-Gurion International Airport well within range of Hamas rockets from Gaza, a place considered hazardous enough that many international airlines have stopped flying there.

Just the day before, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany had to be evacuated from his own plane at the same airport because of air raid sirens and rushed to a shelter. The reporters traveling with him? Ordered to throw themselves down on the tarmac and lie flat until the danger passed.

Just the day before that, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken was similarly hustled to a shelter during a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The reporters with him were scrambled out of vans and into the stairwell of a building to ride out the possible attack."

raja abdulrahim

I’m Raja Abdulrahim, and I’m a reporter in the Jerusalem Bureau, and I’ve been covering the war in Gaza for the past three weeks. [MUSIC PLAYING] On Friday, I was reporting out a story about — basically, it was a sentiment that I was starting to hear a lot from people that death felt inevitable. There is now more than 8,000 deaths in Gaza, more than a third of them children. And we’re hearing basically entire families are being killed in one strike. I spoke to a woman in Gaza.

olfat al-kurd [SPEAKING ARABIC]

raja abdulrahim

Her name is Olfat al-Kurd.

olfat al-kurd [SPEAKING ARABIC]

raja abdulrahim

And she told me that 70 members of her family had been killed — aunts, uncles, cousins. You know, she’d almost lost count of them.

olfat al-kurd [SPEAKING ARABIC]

raja abdulrahim

And what she was telling me and what I’ve been hearing a lot is that these huge death tolls and when everybody around you, when everybody you love is being killed, it just makes people feel that their turn is next.

olfat al-kurd [SPEAKING ARABIC]

raja abdulrahim

The smell of death actually hangs in the air because there’s so many bodies, more than 1,000, that are under the rubble because they don’t have the equipment or they don’t have the ability to get them out. I also spoke with a poet and an essayist, Mosab Abu Toha.

mosab abu toha [SPEAKING ARABIC]

raja abdulrahim

And he was telling me about how, when you’re sitting in your home or wherever you are and you hear the approach of a rocket, the sound feels like it’s coming for you. It feels like it’s intended for you. [MUSIC PLAYING] And I asked him some more questions, but I suddenly noticed that the messages weren’t being delivered. And I wasn’t hearing back. And it wasn’t until a little later that we realized that all phone and internet in Gaza were down. It was very scary to have no eyes on the ground and to not know what was happening in the middle of a war zone. Luckily, our stringer, Ameera, her husband actually has an Israeli SIM card. And she was able to message us.

ameera OK, just to explain the situation here in Gaza today in the streets, it’s a really crazy situation.

raja abdulrahim

I got a very panicked message from her. And in this moment, she’s talking as a Palestinian, as a journalist, as a mother.

ameera People, they are very scared and terrified. They keep asking us, as a journalist, do you know what happened, what’s the news, is there any ceasefire, where they bombed last night.

raja abdulrahim

And she told me that there was so much fear and so much panic and so much confusion on the ground because everybody was worried, what did this blackout mean, and what was Israel planning to do?

ameera — morning. We’re all fine here in the camp. So far, we don’t know what’s happened in Gaza. We cannot even reach my family, like my mom, my sisters in Gaza City, to check how they are or if they survived this night or not.

raja abdulrahim

And that’s the thing with this blackout is that not only were people in Gaza cut off from the rest of the world, but they were cut off from each other.

ameera During the night, they were very heavy bombing, and a lot of clashes, like shooting. We hear the shooting. We hear that there is, like, a fight.

raja abdulrahim

And what was happening was that it was the most intense night of the war so far in terms of Israeli airstrikes. A lot of Palestinians describe it as the most terrifying night they’d ever lived.

ameera By cutting the communication and the telephone lines, they cannot even, people, call the ambulance or call the civil defense or call anyone to come to help them.

raja abdulrahim

She was telling me about how the ambulance services, because nobody was able to call them, they didn’t know where to go.

ameera They are looking for the smoke to know exactly where is the area of the bombing. And they are asking people around to reach the area where they bombed so they can go and help people.

raja abdulrahim

And so some of them were following the sounds of people screaming, or they were basically just driving through the streets, looking for places that had been recently hit with Israeli airstrikes. And then, suddenly, Sunday morning, the phone and internet was restored. [MUSIC PLAYING] People’s phones started getting messages, and a lot of it were messages of other family members trying to check up on them. But also, it was a lot of the news of what had happened since Friday night. And they saw that Israel had started to conduct its ground invasion. And this causes, obviously, a whole new level of fear.

sabrina tavernise

From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise, and this is “The Daily.” Over the weekend, the Israeli military appears to have begun an invasion of the Gaza Strip, with tanks rolling into the enclave and Israeli soldiers fighting with Hamas inside. But the operation remained shrouded in secrecy, with Israel revealing little about its actions. Today, my colleagues, Raja Abdulrahim and Patrick Kingsley on the latest escalation in the war. It’s Monday, October 30. So, Patrick, we’re reaching you on Sunday at about 3:00 PM Eastern time. And that’s 9:00 PM your time in Jerusalem. And we just heard from our colleague, Raja. She was talking about how things had changed in Gaza over the weekend. And I’m wondering if you can tell us what you know about what happened in Israel over the past three days. Start on Friday for me. What did we start to see happen?

patrick kingsley

Early on Friday evening, we began hearing reports of a massive aerial bombardment over Gaza. But at the same time, we were hearing very little about what was actually going on under those bombs because it seemed like there was a communications blackout at that time. The military was conspicuously quiet. It was hard to get any clear answers from them about what was going on. In fact, it was hard to get them to pick up the phone. And then, finally, at around 9:00 PM, amid this shroud of secrecy and silence, the chief military spokesman came out and made a very vague statement in which he said that Israel was expanding its ground activity. And as Friday bled into Saturday, we started to see the first footage of tanks inside Gaza. And it started to feel like this incursion into northern Gaza was something more than just the hourslong incursions that we’d seen on previous nights. But it wasn’t until late afternoon on Saturday that we felt ready to call this the invasion. This was the start of the big push that we’d been expecting for three weeks.

sabrina tavernise

And what was it about what happened late afternoon on Saturday that caused you to start calling it an invasion?

patrick kingsley

Firstly, the fact they were still there, the fact that the military still seemed to be there some 12 hours after they entered. Secondly, the information we were getting from military sources about the numbers of troops that were now inside, the number of tanks, the number of armored vehicles, the number of bulldozers — it eventually became clear that this was a major invasive force. And while it wasn’t some kind of blitzkrieg rush on Gaza City, Hamas’s stronghold, it was nevertheless the start of what is the Israeli ground invasion of Gaza.

sabrina tavernise

And, Patrick, what about Hamas? What were they saying?

patrick kingsley

Hamas made two brief announcements, or, rather, their military wing made two brief announcements. They said they were engaging troops in the north and also a bit further south. And that corresponds now to what we know about the Israeli invasion. They invaded around those two places. And clearly, they ran into Hamas fighters. What those battles look like, we don’t really know, because there was so little information coming out of Gaza, and the Israeli army were also keeping very quiet about what was going on.

sabrina tavernise

Why was the Israeli army keeping so quiet?

patrick kingsley

It’s not entirely clear, but we think one reason was that it wanted to maintain the element of surprise, make Hamas unsure about what was going on. Secondly, we think, perhaps, that Israel wanted to avoid scrutiny, and it wanted to avoid outcry across the Middle East and to avoid an immediate reaction from southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah, another militia allied to Hamas, holds sway, and which Israelis had feared might launch its own major attack on Israel if it felt that Hamas was under threat due to the ground invasion. So Israel making its advance during a communication blackout and without formally announcing it themselves created a sense of uncertainty about what was actually going on that therefore made journalists like us wary about reporting anything and, potentially, also prevented groups like Hezbollah from making their own reaction.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so this is the invasion that we were all anticipating. But at the same time, you’re saying it’s kind of different. What makes you say that? How is it different than what we expected?

patrick kingsley

I think we expected, perhaps naively, that we would know what was going on in real time, that we’d have photography, video of something happening. In retrospect, we now know certain details. We know they entered from the northwest of Gaza. At least some of the forces advanced down the Gazan coastline. There’s video now that’s been released from the Israeli army that shows tanks and other vehicles moving along the beaches of northern Gaza. Video has also emerged of a pair of Israeli soldiers standing atop what is believed to be a beachside hotel raising an Israeli flag.

sabrina tavernise

Hmm.

patrick kingsley

We also understand that so far the Israeli army has not pushed that far deep into Gaza. It hasn’t entered into Gaza City, the biggest urban center of the enclave. It appears to be waiting, almost surrounding the city. And this has been accompanied by many statements from Israeli officials, both in the military and outside, saying that this is going to be a long, long process and that they won’t be charging into Gaza City as quickly as perhaps we’d expected three weeks ago.

sabrina tavernise

Why do you think the Israeli military is taking this kind of different approach? Do you think that they were responding to pressure from the US?

patrick kingsley

Well, you’re right that the US has been warning Israel not to act out of emotion, not to act too swiftly, to make sure that they have clear plans in place before moving in. Everyone’s worried about the outbreak of a regional war. And it’s quite possible that this maneuver shrouded in secrecy was intended to try and delay any prospect of regional reaction for as long as possible until the invasion seemed a fait accompli that could not be stopped. And perhaps that’s why there was essentially a day of uncertainty and the fog over what was going on. [MUSIC PLAYING] And by the time that Benjamin Netanyahu made his speech on Saturday night in which he announced the second phase of this conflict, the Israeli army had already been inside Gaza for more than 24 hours. And their presence was a fact rather than a possibility.

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. So, Patrick, you told us that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a speech on Saturday night. What did he say?

archived recording (benjamin netanyahu) [SPEAKING HEBREW]

patrick kingsley

He said a number of things.

archived recording (benjamin netanyahu) [SPEAKING HEBREW]

patrick kingsley

The first is that this is the second stage of the war. And that was significant because it confirmed what we already gathered by ourselves by that point, which is that the invasion had begun. Yet he didn’t actually use the word “invasion.”

sabrina tavernise

Hmm.

patrick kingsley

Then he said —

patrick kingsley

—“The war inside Gaza will be long and difficult, and we are ready for it.

archived recording (benjamin netanyahu) [SPEAKING HEBREW]

patrick kingsley

And that was perhaps aimed at the Israeli public that is going to have to come to terms with many losses to its own in the coming months.

patrick kingsley

Then he talks about meeting the families of Israeli hostages who were kidnapped during Hamas’s own invasion of Israeli territory on October 7.

archived recording (benjamin netanyahu) [SPEAKING HEBREW]

patrick kingsley

And he said, “We will exhaust every possibility to bring our brothers and sisters back to their families.” That was an attempt to reassure the families of the hostages, who have enormous public sympathy and support, that this invasion is not intended to come at the cost of those hostages’ lives.

sabrina tavernise

And what else did Netanyahu say in the speech?

patrick kingsley

He talked about one supreme goal, to “destroy the murderous enemy and ensure our existence in our land.”

archived recording (benjamin netanyahu) [SPEAKING HEBREW]

patrick kingsley

And that is maybe tilted towards the international audience. It’s a reminder that for Israelis, they cannot countenance living next to Hamas on its borders for another minute. And then finally —

archived recording (benjamin netanyahu) [SPEAKING HEBREW]

patrick kingsley

He says that “this is our second war of independence.” The first so-called War of Independence was in 1948, when Israel’s fledgling army defeated several Arab armies and Palestinian militias in order to create the boundaries of the modern state. And that war was and remains a unifying event in the minds of most Israelis because it was the foundational event of the state of Israel. So by talking about it, Netanyahu was trying to present himself as a unifying leader, someone that can bring Israelis together after a period of great division in Israeli society. And to supporters, that may have felt credible. To critics, that would have come across as very hollow. And to Palestinians, that same comment would have felt very chilling but for different reasons. During the 1948 War, some 700,000 Palestinian Arabs, or 80 percent of the Arab population of Mandate Palestine, the territory that Israel was formed from in 1948, either fled their homes or were forced to flee their homes, never to return. And that moment in Palestinian history is known as the Nakba, or “catastrophe.” It was hugely traumatic and remains perhaps the defining moment of the Palestinian experience and is seen as almost the start of all of Palestinian trauma over the past 75 years. So that was Saturday. But on the ground in Gaza, things were still very uncertain. And it was very unclear what was going on.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so that’s Saturday night. Today’s Sunday. Tell me what we’ve learned now that the communications have come back online.

patrick kingsley

We’re learning that once again, there was devastating loss of civilian life in Gaza. We’re learning that the fighting inside Gaza appears to have taken its first Israeli casualties. The Israeli military said this morning that two soldiers had been wounded during the fighting that started after the invasion. And we learned from the Israeli military that they say that they have hit 450 military targets throughout Saturday and early Sunday. And those targets include command centers, observation posts, antitank missile launch posts, and leaders of Hamas’s military wing. We also know that they say that they hit 150 underground facilities, some of which may indeed be tunnels. All these are impossible to verify.

sabrina tavernise

So, Patrick, stepping back here for a minute, where do you think we are in this war right now? Netanyahu has said, “We are in a second phase.” You know, we don’t know how many more there will be. Where are we, and where are we going?

patrick kingsley

Well, the entire region is waiting with bated breath to see how do Hamas’s allies in southern Lebanon respond. Will they up the ante? Will they launch missiles and rockets deeper into Israeli territory? Or will they hold fire and prevent a major escalation on the Israeli-Lebanese border? Inside Gaza, we are braced for what many think will be the bloodiest phase of what has already been a catastrophically bloody war. 8,000 Palestinians have already died, 1,400 Israelis. And the ground phase of the war is thought by most analysts to be the deadliest one. Once the Israeli army moves from the countryside outside Gaza City into the city itself and is met by Hamas fighters on their home turf, emerging from secret exit points from their tunnel network, the war is going to get very bloody indeed for Palestinian civilians, also for Hamas, and also for Israeli soldiers. And quite what Gaza will look like at the end of it is unclear. [MUSIC PLAYING] We’re at the edge of a precipice. And we don’t know exactly where we — where Gaza are going to land.

sabrina tavernise

Patrick, thank you.

patrick kingsley

The Israeli military said today that 240 people were taken hostage during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7. As Israeli forces move closer to Gaza City, families continue to demand that the government prioritize the safety and rescue of their loved ones.

Isabel Kershner, a Times correspondent in Jerusalem, talks to Lulu Garcia-Navarro about the precarious situation that the Israeli government finds itself in, waging a war in territory where Israeli citizens are most likely being held.

The Israel-Hamas war is evolving by the minute. To help bring you the most up-to-date developments, we’re beginning “The Headlines: War Briefing,” where you’ll hear the latest from our correspondents on the ground every afternoon. Hosted by Lulu Garcia-Navarro."
12,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/briefing/the-wars-next-stage.html,"Israel announced it will attack Gaza from the air, land and sea, expanding its war against Hamas days after its tanks began an intense ground operation. The military again urged civilians to move south as troops have entered Gaza from the north (see where troops crossed the border).

Benjamin Netanyahu called the troops’ arrival the “second stage” of the war and warned Israelis to expect a long, difficult fight. But he did not say that Israel had launched a full ground invasion. While the number of soldiers in Gaza remains unclear, a more limited initial ground war would align with recent suggestions from the U.S. defense secretary, The Times’s Eric Schmitt reports.

The first stage of the war has been a bombing campaign that Palestinians say has killed thousands of people, many of them children. Israel said its airstrikes were intended to hit military targets, like Hamas’s fighters and weapons stores. But experts say the majority of the group’s fighters and many of its weapons are underground in a vast network of tunnels, making it difficult for Israel to strike them from the air.

In this next stage, the ground war, troops are expected to face bloody urban combat. Hamas is likely to booby-trap apartments and fire at Israelis from rooftops. Gaza’s densely packed streets are difficult to attack with tanks, which could help Hamas despite Israel’s stronger military.

Details of the fighting are expected to become clearer today as phone and internet service begins to return to Gaza. The enclave was in a near-total blackout for much of the weekend. Palestinians said that airstrikes had cut off cell networks, making it harder for them to coordinate medical rescues, speak to family or share news about the fighting.

The blackout also complicated evacuation efforts. For more than two weeks, Israel has been calling on Gazans to move south, closer to the border with Egypt, an order that has pushed hundreds of thousands to leave their homes.

As desperation spread during the blackout, thousands of people broke into warehouses to take aid, like flour, according to the U.N. The Israeli military said, without giving details, that humanitarian efforts to send more aid to Gaza — led by Egypt and the U.S. — would be expanded tomorrow.

The latest on the fighting

The Israeli military said two of its soldiers were injured overnight in northern Gaza, its first reported casualties of the expanded ground incursion. Follow our updates.

The Israeli military and Hezbollah clashed along the border with Lebanon, fueling fears of a wider war.

From New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.” [MUSIC PLAYING] So on Friday, Israel began its ground war in Gaza. They cut all cellular communications for 34 hours, creating chaos not just for Hamas but for the vast majority of the more than two million Palestinians who live in Gaza. I found this line in the “New York Times” pretty tough. Quote, “They had no way to know whether their loved ones were alive or dead. Emergency phone lines stopped ringing. Desperate paramedics tried to save people by driving toward the sound of explosions. Wounded people were left to die in the street.” Imagine hearing or seeing an explosion not far from you and not being able to call your relatives who live there. Palestinian health officials say that more than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed since Oct. 7. And I want to note here that there is a fog of war. It is possible these numbers are wrong. It is also, of course, possible that, particularly by the end of this, these numbers will be much higher. But if you take something like the 8,000 number as right, well, then one way the horror of Oct. 7 was driven home, one way its scale was driven home to Americans was to put it in terms of 9/11s. Adjusting for population, Joe Biden said it was like 15 9/11s. If you take that same math, then Gaza’s experience so far around 400 9/11s. What does that do to a population? Something on my mind right now, for obvious reasons, is protests against Israel have broken out all over the world. Anti-Semitism is surging across the Chinese internet, as state-run media there blames the United States for, quote, “blindly backing Israel.” In Dagestan, a majority Muslim republic in Southern Russia, dozens were arrested after storming an airport hunting for people who had arrived on a flight from Tel Aviv. At Cornell University, the Jewish Center was under guard after threats of violence. A few blocks away from me, the synagogue I take my children to on weekends was spray painted. I took my kids to the park over the weekend and was rerouted because the streets were closed for anti-Israel protests. My kids kept excitedly running to the window of our home to watch lines of police marching past to keep order. And I’m not convinced this will make Israel safer. I fear it’ll be just the opposite. I don’t believe the punishment being meted out on ordinary Gazans is moral or is justified. But I also recognize criticism is easy, and I don’t live in Israel or in Gaza. And so there’s been this void, I think, at the heart of a lot of coverage, mine included. What should Israel have done? What should they do? If not this, then what? Zack Beauchamp is a senior correspondent at Vox, and he’s covered Israel extensively in recent years. And so he set out to answer that exact question. And he spoke with counterterrorism experts and military historians and experts on Hamas. And I found his piece, “What Israel Should Do Now,” one of the best I’ve read since Oct. 7, one of the ones most clarifying. And so I asked him to join me on the show. And I should note, because things are changing so quickly, that Zack and I spoke on Thursday, Oct. 26. And a lot has happened since then, but nothing, I think, that changes the analysis here. As always, my email ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING] Zack Beauchamp, welcome to the show.

zack beauchamp

Hey, Ezra. It’s good to be here with you.

ezra klein

So I wanted to start with something you wrote, which is that “Two things are true. Israel must do something, and what it’s doing now is indefensible.” And I want to take them in turn. So first, why must Israel do something?

zack beauchamp

I spent a lot of time thinking about this question because it seems like the big demand from a lot of people who are critics of Israel is just you should have a cease-fire. They should stop doing what they’re currently doing. I heard this from Palestinians I spoke with. The problem with that, from the Israeli point of view, is that the massacre of Oct. 7 represented not just a breach of security but a signal collapse in the state’s capacity to provide for the security of the Israeli people. They can’t live in a world where they think this kind of thing would happen again or might happen again. I think about a conversation I had with Stav Shaffir, who is a former member of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, from the Labor Party, which was a longtime stalwart of the Israeli left. She’s a peacenik, right? Her view for a long time has been two states. Her politics are very focused on inequality inside Israel. Real not like of the far left, but a left-wing Israeli person. When I spoke to Stav, the palpable pain and fear in her voice, and anger and the understanding of what Hamas was after this attack as being a monstrous, intolerable threat to Israel. She told me, we need to destroy Hamas. No qualifiers. She was like, we can’t live next to them anymore. And when you hear that kind of thing from somebody who is so affiliated with the left side of the Israeli political spectrum, it gives you a real insight into the way in which Israelis of all stripes have unified around a need to do something — something really, really dramatic about the Hamas threat. This can never be tolerated again from their point of view. I mean, it speaks to the heart of what Israel is as a country in their mind. From their point of view, Israel exists because Jews were insecure elsewhere. Jews needed their own country with a strong army to be able to protect themselves from this kind of massacre. And if civilians can be killed in such horrific ways, the state has failed. And it needs to do something to show that it hasn’t been a failure. And an expert on Israeli politics told me this point blank. No cease-fire and no return to the status quo. Something needs to change. What that is, that’s less clear. But what we do know is that needs to be pretty dramatic.

ezra klein

Let’s hold for a second on the question of a cease-fire, because as you say, that’s become a demand. It is not going to happen at the moment.

zack beauchamp

No.

ezra klein

To some degree, I almost think the meta conversation of a cease-fire is whether you are allowed to call for one in American politics without being sidelined. But would one be a good idea?

zack beauchamp

I think a temporary cease-fire for the provision of humanitarian aid is very defensible. The situation in Gaza is absolutely dire on humanitarian terms, and something needs to be done to deal with the spread of infectious disease, the lack of water. I mean, it’s truly horrifying. At the same time, though, Israel hasn’t done enough to deal with the problem that Hamas creates.

ezra klein

So then let me take the other half of your formulation. What is it doing now? And why do you call what it’s doing now, which is the beginning of what it’s doing, indefensible?

zack beauchamp

So I think there’s one really obviously indefensible component, which is the cut-off of electricity, fuel and water supplies to Gaza. This amounts to collective punishment of civilians. I mean, there’s really no definition of the morality of war under which one can say you can do that to people. And if you look at any dispatch from the ground in Gaza, and you look and you engage with the human toll and the suffering going on, you really understand that what Israel is doing is hurting — really, really hurting innocent people, children even, for no good reason. There are a lot of significant problems with its bombing campaign as well. There are questions about how discriminate it’s being in target selection and what targets it’s choosing. But in general, I think the bigger picture is it’s not clear what Israel wants to get out of the current offensive. Their stated objective is to defeat Hamas. It’s not clear what that means based on the current rhetoric, and it’s not clear if the current bombing contributes to it. And if you’re going to inflict this level of suffering on civilians, even unintentionally or as a byproduct of legitimate tactics, you need to have a real endpoint. You need to know what you’re doing.

ezra klein

In what you have read or heard, or in your reporting, has there been an articulated goal of the siege specifically?

zack beauchamp

I have never seen any defense from anyone of the siege that makes sense in my mind. The horrible justifications that you hear from some Israeli leaders are things like, honestly comparing the residents of Gaza to human animals or saying something like that. You’ve heard versions of that language twice from Israeli leaders.

ezra klein

From the defense minister.

zack beauchamp

Right. Now, it sounded like he was referring to Hamas. But others —

ezra klein

But he was specifically talking about the siege. That’s what —

zack beauchamp

Yeah.

ezra klein

That’s what unnerved me about that statement. If he said human animals and he means Hamas, fine. But when what precedes it is we’re cutting off food and water and electricity. That’s clearly not just from Hamas.

zack beauchamp

No. It just isn’t reasonable. It’s worse than that. It is an incredible amount of anger being unleashed on civilians who are basically themselves held captive by Hamas, right? Hamas is — contrary to what you may hear from some Israelis — not popular. People don’t like living under an authoritarian theocratic regime. It’s just very, very difficult to rebel and overthrow a government. There are things that people like about Hamas as well. There are certain social services it provides. They like that, unlike the Palestinian Authority, it stands up to Israel in some visible way, even ways that strike us and are, in fact, morally horrifying. But none of that is a justification or any kind of reasonable justification for hurting this many people.

ezra klein

So let me offer two different possible rationales for the siege. And the first is maybe the most classic, which is you’re simply literally weakening the enemy. If there is not electricity, and fuel, and food, and water going to Hamas either — I mean, you’ve taken it from a lot of people, but going to them either. If the population is furious that Hamas has done this to them, if they do hold Hamas at least partially culpable for the Israeli punishment, then maybe you make it easier to uproot Hamas. You weaken Hamas as a fighting force. You weaken their hold on the population. And as brutal as it is, it actually leads to a shorter or at least more winnable conflict. What do you think of that?

zack beauchamp

So what happens when you conduct a siege like that is the resources that are left — generators, oil, whatever ways of scrounging up water exist — they get diverted to the military opponent that you’re facing. So what you end up doing might not end up hurting Hamas immediately, but it will, without a doubt, end up doing extraordinary amounts of harm to the civilian population. The policy isn’t very well thought through on a tactical level. There are some advantages to it. But if you really play it out, it doesn’t do, I think, what some people who are OK with it think it will. And that’s even before we talk about the real problem with it, which is the morality, right? Sieges are permissible military tactic according to a lot of ethicists when it’s really just an enemy enclave. Ultimately if there’s only fighters there, it’s not very different to blow them up than to starve them out in moral terms. But when civilians are there, it’s a whole different ballgame. And there are two million people in Gaza. Hamas’s fighting force — I believe the estimate is 30,000. That’s 1.97 million people who you’re starving out, who you’re depriving of water, of adequate sanitation, of medical resources, to get at 30,000. To me, there’s just no way to make those numbers work morally in any kind of humane or remotely defensible military policy.

ezra klein

So there’s another rationale that I’ve heard, which is if you make life in Gaza untenable, if you make staying in Gaza choosing starvation or waterborne infectious disease or choosing thirst for your children, if you make Gazans flee by the hundreds of thousands, and tell them to do it so they’re not in the way of the bombs, maybe they don’t come back or maybe you don’t let them come back. So you have hundreds of thousands of Gazans just gone. And one difficulty with that before is that Egypt won’t let them in. But if there’s enough misery, maybe that pushes the Egyptian government to open the border. And so that’s been this other theory of what Israel might be attempting to achieve here. And I’m not saying that it’s moral or according to the rules of war, but it is a coherent strategy if part of Israel’s goal is fewer Palestinians in Gaza.

zack beauchamp

Yeah, it’s possible that that’s what it is. I mean, you’ve heard at least from one Likud lawmaker in Israel — it’s Netanyahu’s party — saying that what they want is a second Nakba, which means a second catastrophe for Palestinians. And that refers to the 1948 war when Palestinians were, in large part, forced out of lands that’s now controlled by Israel. But it’s not clear to me if that’s actually guiding policy. Based on my conversations with experts in the area, I don’t think the goal is that well thought out or deliberate. Israeli policymakers were reacting out of rage, out of panic, out of a sense of a need to do something, and imposed a policy that they thought was justified by Hamas’s attack. Now, I don’t think it is personally. But I think it really is, more than anything else, a product of feeling like there’s been this incredible assault on Israel, and they need to do everything they can to address it.

ezra klein

So one description of Israel’s strategy and where it might be going came from this interview in Politico with Amos Yadlin, who’s former chief of Israeli military intelligence, a sort of important Israeli military thinker. And to situate him, he’s on the center left in Israel, part of Labor. And he said that “They are thinking of Gaza like a neighboring country run by the government of Hamas,” end quote. “We declare war on this country. And we are going to destroy this state very much like what the Allies did to Germany in 1945, very much like what the U.S. did to ISIS, to the caliphate in Iraq and Syria, 2014 to 2019.” And so what I take him as saying is that if you shift the metaphor a bit, don’t think of Hamas as a terrorist organization hiding among civilians, think of them as a legitimate government of Gaza, then invading Gaza and destroying the government and the state that attacked you is the most normal thing of all in military history.

zack beauchamp

That’s totally right. And it also — in terms of the Israeli thinking — and it also came up — I mean, it’s omnipresent in Israeli discourse. The ISIS analogies and the Nazi analogies, in particular, are really dominant inside the Israeli conversation right now. One example — I was talking about the siege with an Israeli military historian. I told him that I thought it was very difficult to defend. And he said something like, well, did the Allies provide electricity to the Nazis during World War II? He also, by the way, was a figure on the center left. He said, I support a two-state solution, et cetera. These aren’t just rabid right-wingers. There’s a consensus in Israel that Hamas really is a neighboring government that needs to be destroyed. The question, I think, is what destroyed means and whether or not you support — you really support what it would mean to try to launch a purely military effort to eliminate Hamas.

ezra klein

Let’s hold on that for a minute because I want to get to something beneath some of the defenses here that I’ve heard even just from Jewish people more in support of Israel’s current tactics in my own life. One thing they say — or one thing I hear in what they’re saying — is that they feel Israel, in 2023, is being held to laws and mores of war that did not exist, really, or at least were not followed, when America won the wars that made America what it is today, and among other things, importantly in this, defeated the Nazis, when the countries that exist today won their territory often by displacing other peoples and creating mass migrations. That there is a demand on Israel to act in a way other states did not have to act because it was not the modern era with all these niceties like the U.N. and phones where you can see what people are doing on the ground. But that in truth, war has always been more brutal. And that when you are trying to eliminate a threat like this, you have to be more brutal. And that Israel’s being held to an unusually high standard that nobody else has demanded their countries in the past meet.

zack beauchamp

So I think that’s partially true. But I think a lot of it has to do less with changing norms and double standards than it does with the nature of the Hamas threat itself. And what Hamas has done — there’s actually a technical term for this in the philosophy of just war — it’s called perfidy. It’s a specific kind of abuse of the laws of war where you manipulate them such that your opponent can’t wage war justly, when you force, essentially you use morality as a shield to protect yourself. And that’s Hamas’s strategy. They want in these military campaigns lots of Palestinian civilians to die. They want them to die rather than their fighters. They want them to die because that’s what helps them win in the long run. It gets them more support. It shows that the Israelis are as brutal as Palestinians think they are. It gets them international sympathy. They are — the Israelis are forced into fighting a truly evil group. But the fact that they’ve committed perfidy and that they’ve done horrible things doesn’t mean that you can just do whatever you want. If that’s the case, the things that Israel could do are far, far worse than the things that it’s already doing, which is a frightening prospect.

ezra klein

We’re speaking on Thursday, Oct. 26. As of now, they have not launched the ground invasion of Gaza. The expectation is that they will. I guess we will see. One thing you spent a lot of time doing in your reporting is talking to experts on military strategy, on the region, on counterterrorism, about what it would mean to invade Gaza and whether it would end up making Israel safer, whether it was a good idea. What did you find?

zack beauchamp

So I want to start with the actual invasion itself, the we’re going to send troops and we’re going to try to essentially topple the Hamas government as they see it. Well, that’s really hard in military terms. Hamas has this gigantic tunnel network. I’ve heard one description that says it’s larger than the London tube.

ezra klein

And can I note something about this that I think people don’t fully hear on it?

zack beauchamp

Sure. Go ahead.

ezra klein

I think people hear this and they think Hamas has built a bunch of tunnels underground in the last year — a couple of years — in order to make it harder to fight them on the ground in Gaza, like a war-fighting strategy. But this is more than a decade-long project with huge amounts of investment in it because it is the only way the Gazan import/export economy can work. And so you’re dealing with a tunnel network that I think is much more stunning than people are used to because it wasn’t particularly at the beginning just for a war-fighting purpose. These are not little tunnels to hide a person in so he can pop out and shoot you. These are tunnels that you can bring construction materials through, tunnels that you can bring huge amounts of material in. When I started to understand the depth of the tunnel network, this looked a lot different to me.

zack beauchamp

Yeah, and that’s layered on top of the ordinary challenges of fighting in an urban environment, which is already on its own very, very difficult. You have to watch for threats from the sky. Drones, for example. You have to watch for threats from the building. Soldiers sniping at your soldiers or firing R.P.G.s. And you have to watch at the street level or whatever it is that Hamas has set up on the ground, plus below you. For invading Israeli soldiers, this is a death trap. And second, lots and lots of civilians would die, in part because of the Israeli need to protect their own soldiers. There’s a direct trade-off in urban warfare if you’re in a populated area between what you do to preserve your own soldier’s life, which would involve a lot of airstrikes in advance and generally having a pretty loose set of rules of engagement, and what you do to preserve civilian life, which is minimizing the amount of airstrikes that you use and going very slowly and putting your own troops at risk.

ezra klein

When I hear something like “destroy Hamas” as the objective, I think the question for me that brings up is, what is Hamas? And a couple of answers present. Hamas is people. There are people who hold positions within Hamas or are foot soldiers within Hamas. There’s material, right? They have caches of rockets and drones and so on. It is, to some degree, local support, the attachment from the civilian population that gives them new recruits and allows them to hide within the citizenry, and is why they, to some degree at least, rule Gaza. So I guess you’re saying you’re going to destroy those three things. I’m sure there are more that you can think of. But I’m curious what you hear when — what do you have to destroy to have destroyed Hamas?

zack beauchamp

When I talk to Israelis, there is not a clear sense of what that term means. And in many ways, it’s really the crux of the issue. There’s a consensus on, you need to destroy Hamas. But there’s a question of what that means and what it entails. I think the ordinary language understanding of it and the one that is most prevalent in the discussion is it means literally end the organization. Destroy the organization that mounted the Oct. 7 attacks and never allow it to constitute itself again. It’s an incredibly tall order. It’s very, very, very hard to do that as any kind of military, even one as well-equipped and advanced and trained as the IDF is. There’s another meaning of it, though, which is to destroy Hamas’s military capability. Destroy the people who were responsible for this attack and ensure that it could never happen. Again maybe something named Hamas will still exist after that. Maybe it’ll still operate. Maybe it’ll even still rule Gaza. But you can say, if you’re an Israeli, that we destroyed the organization, meaning specifically the people who were in charge and executed the Oct. 7 attack. Those are two senses of the term, both of which could be used. But I get the strong impression that the former is predominating in Israel. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Let’s say they execute a ground invasion, and let’s say that they can do a fair amount. They’re able to degrade a lot of Hamas’s military capabilities. They’re able to kill a number of Hamas’s top leadership, a number of its foot soldiers. Then what?

zack beauchamp

So that is the million dollar question. And it is the question that no one I have spoken to and I don’t think anyone in the Israeli government actually has a plan for. I’d really recommend reading a piece in “The Financial Times” on this where they got a bunch of senior Israeli sources on record talking about the planning. It turns out they’re still planning it. This piece was like — at the time we’re recording, it was like a day or two ago.

ezra klein

We’ll put this piece in the show notes.

zack beauchamp

There’s one fantastic quote in there that says, “The Americans went ballistic when they heard that Israel had no plan for what to do in the event after Hamas.” Basically, I think there’s three options, and of them only one of them is really feasible if what you really want to do is destroy Hamas. So the first one is that you just go in, you wreck the place and you leave. And if that happens, well, Hamas probably just reconstitutes itself. We know, from pretty bitter experience on the American side, that you can’t take out a terrorist organization in one fell swoop. A second option would be to install some kind of collaborationist Palestinian government and then leave. The problem with that is if you don’t back it with armed force, Hamas or some other kind of Palestinian militant — there are a lot of them in the Gaza Strip — end up toppling this government and you’re right back where you started. So the third option, and the one that strikes me as most likely based on my own conversations with Israelis, is an extended occupation of Gaza. If you really want to destroy the entity that calls itself Hamas, the most literal definition, that’s what you have to do. You go to Gaza. You occupy it for a long period of time. You engage in a pretty lengthy counterinsurgency campaign designed to topple the government, designed to ensure that Hamas — that its support is entirely stamped out among the population and it lacks its ability to rebuild. And then, only then, after a very long period of fighting, do you try to create a government that can operate without Israeli forces on the ground. This, to me, seems like a nightmarish option for any number of reasons. But right now I’m worried, based on what’s coming out of the Israeli government, that that’s what they’re sort of sleepwalking towards.

ezra klein

Why is that a nightmarish option? They occupied Gaza for a long time. And I don’t think right now the pullout — and I think it’s strange language because it kept the blockade and a lot of control over it — but they did not occupy Gaza in the way they had. They did not try to govern it in the way they had. And I don’t think right now they look at that as a success.

zack beauchamp

No, I mean, look, Hamas built itself while Israel was occupying Gaza, right? That’s when the organization really came to prominence in the 1990s when it conducted a series of terrorist attacks inside Israel that were very explicitly designed to disrupt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process at that time. And this was Israel was still occupying Gaza. So that’s one thing, right, is that doesn’t really work if you look at the historical record. The other thing is looking at different kinds of historical records, namely the experience of countries occupying what are essentially foreign countries in a counterinsurgency campaign. And it’s quite bad. These very often fail to accomplish their goal of creating a peaceful post-war environment. They create a situation where these terrorist groups can reconstitute themselves often in worse forms. That’s the origin story of ISIS. It really grew out of al-Qaeda in Iraq, which was itself not very strong until the U.S. invaded Iraq.

ezra klein

One thing that I feel like people who know a lot about ISIS are being driven crazy by right now is that the analogy to ISIS, which has become so popular — Hamas as ISIS — runs the other way.

zack beauchamp

Yeah, it’s like you don’t want to encourage the growth of — I mean, you can’t say a worse version of Hamas. They’re already pretty horrible, right? But an environment where they can reconstitute themselves in even stronger form. Because there are two important salient facts about how that might and probably would happen. The first is something that Marc Lynch, who’s an expert on Arab politics, told me when I was talking to him, is he’s like, look, when the U.S. invaded Iraq, there were some real constituencies — Shia, Kurds, who hated Saddam Hussein and had some interest in cooperating with the invaders. There’s nothing like that in Gaza. Nothing. Everyone hates Israel. They hate Israel because of the years of occupation prior to Hamas. They hate Israel because of the blockade. They hate Israel because of all the bombing campaigns. There’s no group in Gaza that would welcome or cooperate with an Israeli counterinsurgency campaign, which means you’re in there with Israeli forces who are getting shot at by Hamas partisans who are hiding among the population all the time. It’s the nightmare scenario for any effort to try to impose governance on a society. Who’s going to cooperate with you? Who are you going to get to run the government when you can’t do it? It’s just — there’s no plausible, to me, end game for how you bring peace to such an environment. And really the most likely outcome — and this is the second thing I was alluding to — is that Hamas builds its support among Palestinians because it shows itself to be resisting the Israeli occupation. And even if Israel has good intentions, the best possible intentions, which they may not, war crimes happen as part of these occupations. They do. They’re inevitable. Every time that happens, Hamas gains new supporters. Every Palestinian child who’s killed by an Israeli bomb or accidentally shot by an Israeli ground soldier, blown up by a tank, every single one of those is a victory for Hamas.

ezra klein

I think sometimes about the math of vengeance in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And one of the things that’s been on my mind is our attunement to the Israeli math right now, right? Joe Biden’s saying that Oct. 7 was like 15 9/11s when you adjust for population. So Gaza is smaller than Israel. Two million people. We don’t really know the exact number of killed Gazans at this point. But it seems safe to say it’s significantly higher than 1,400 in a smaller area. There have been many killed before this, of course, over years and years of fighting. So what percentage of Gazans are one degree away or know somebody one degree away from somebody killed in an Israeli attack? I would assume that it approaches 100 percent.

zack beauchamp

Very high. I mean, look, if you talk to Israelis, almost everybody knows somebody.

ezra klein

Right. And I think we have a sensitivity to that, right? It fills me with despair when I think about that. But that is — I mean, put aside the question of Hamas, that is the wellspring of conflict, whether that conflict organizes itself under the banner of Hamas or not. Everything that Israelis feel right now in wanting to avenge their dead, Palestinians feel too. And as you keep adding more fuel of vengeance, I mean that does create this long-term question, even aside from its short-term horror, of where does that go?

zack beauchamp

I mean, look, the most cliché term in Middle East politics, or specifically Arab-Israeli politics, is cycle of violence. But it’s cliché for a reason because it’s true for exactly the reasons that you just described. When you inflict violence on one group, they demand a violent response. It just is the way that this conflict has gone forever. And so the purpose of violence, if what you want is peace in the end — and that is not true for all of the actors in this conflict — but if what you want is peace, violence should only be used as a tactical measure in order to gain some degree of security that allows you to make longer-term steps for peace and movements towards peace. And that’s just not what’s happening right now. The Hamas attack was the opposite of that. It was designed — some experts on Hamas think that the spectacular brutality, I mean the truly awful description of what happened to Israeli civilians on that day — I’m not going to get into them for the mental health of your listeners, but it’s beyond evil to hear about — that that was the point. Those kinds of atrocities would force such a heavy-handed response to Israel that violent resistance in the Palestinian orbit would become the only acceptable cause, and that the more peaceful approach of the Palestinian Authority and the Fatah party would be discredited.

ezra klein

In some ways, it’s easy to know so much about the Israel-Palestine conflict, so much about its tortured contested history, who did what at the Camp David talks in 2000, and what was going on in Oslo and the Second Intifada. You get really caught up in the specifics of it, and often correctly so. But we actually know some things about terrorism broadly. Sometimes I think it is useful to abstract out of this conflict and think about others. And you talked to Audrey Kurth Cronin, who’s a military strategy expert and the author of the book “How Terrorism Ends,” which is probably the best study of how terrorism ends. What does her research say?

zack beauchamp

So one of Audrey’s main research questions was the extent to which what she calls repression — that’s just violence, basically, of various different forms — is effective at dealing with terrorism and addressing it. And what she found in the roughly 460 cases that she examined is that it’s not. It doesn’t typically work. And there are lots of reasons for that. One of them is that the amount of violence that you need to do over a long period of time to repress a terrorist organization is, A, huge, and B, often quite indiscriminate. One thing I’ve learned from other studies of war and conflict is that a lot of civilian allegiance depends — and this is sort of very intuitive and surprising people don’t think about it more — it depends on their own self-interest. If you are literally going to die because you don’t collaborate with X group, then you’ll collaborate with X group regardless of what your ideological or other allegiances incline you towards. There’s a great book on this by Stathis Kalyvas, who’s a Greek political scientist. It’s called “The Logic of Violence in Civil Wars.” But what that means is to really get civilians to not want to cooperate with an insurgent or terrorist group, a lot of the time that entails threatening their lives in very, very, very large numbers, directly and intentionally. Committing war crimes, right? So a good example of this is the Sri Lankan military’s defeat of the Tamil Tigers. It took many years, was extremely bloody, and involved wide-scale repression of the Tamil population. Israel will have a very hard time doing that. I know there’s a lot of critics of Israel right now accusing it of committing an incipient genocide. There’s not a lot of evidence that that’s happening, in part because the Israeli military is so strong that it could do so much more if what it really wanted to do was exterminate the Palestinian population or force them into a choice where it’s give up on Hamas or we kill you. They’re not being super discriminate, but they’re not being indiscriminate either. And this speaks to something that Audrey told me, which I think is really insightful. She said that Israel, as a democracy, is really ill-suited to do that kind of strategy.

ezra klein

The strategy of overwhelming repression.

zack beauchamp

That’s right. Because whatever you think about Israel or whatever you think about the politics, its treatment of the Palestinians, there’s a really essential self-conception of Israel as a democracy. It really matters. Even the parties on the extreme right claim to be standing up for Israeli democracy. And there’s a certain set of values associated with that that matter to the population. And so there’s a level of force, a pretty significant level of force they can countenance against Palestinians. But the level of force required to engage in pure repression strategy is well beyond that. I mean, however bad you think this conflict is, a full scale repression strategy would be much, much, much, much worse. Much, much, much, much worse. And it just seems very hard to imagine the Israeli government doing that because it would cost them everything, both domestically and geopolitically. The U.S. — I mean, that’s the kind of thing that could force the U.S. to abandon Israel.

ezra klein

So if overwhelming repression doesn’t typically work, what does?

zack beauchamp

I mean, a lot of it isn’t something that external actors do, right? Sometimes terrorist groups just implode. Sometimes they get overtaken by a rival for political supremacy for one reason or another. But the one that you can have some influence over, it looks like, is addressing the political foundations of that terrorist group support and doing something to address the grievances that fuel it or coming to some kind of political agreement with the group itself. Here, the classic textbook example are the Good Friday Accords that ended the conflict in Northern Ireland between the I.R.A. and the British government. Good Friday was a very long process. I mean, getting there was a long and violent one. Not quite so violent as the Israel-Palestine conflict, but it was very serious. Eventually, what led to the end of that insurgency was a negotiated settlement. That probably is not possible with Hamas. But there are other ways that you can change the political equation so you can encourage some of these other ways that terrorist groups end, like, for instance, being supplanted by an alternative faction.

ezra klein

I want to put a hold because we’re going to talk about the political equation. But before we get to that, you end up, after all this reporting, when thinking about the short-term military question, saying, “Of all possible options, a focused counterterrorism strategy is the best, most realistic military option available on every level, strategically, morally and politically.” So I want to begin here with definition. What is a counterterrorism strategy? What distinguishes it from things like a Gazan ground invasion, et cetera?

zack beauchamp

No, there might be a ground component to it. So I don’t want to say that’s not at all happening. But the key difference is the question of regime change. Does the Israeli military go in with the intent of putting tanks on the streets of Gaza City and setting up some kind of alternative governing arrangement inside Gaza, or at least creating room for one, or is the goal to, as we discussed a little bit earlier, degrade Hamas to the point where it will no longer be able to pose a threat, at least in the immediate term, to Israeli civilians, other than the occasional sporadic rocket fire that’s very hard to repress? And the latter option is what I come to think of as a counterterrorism operation. And it has a few very nitty-gritty parts to it. One of them is minimizing your ground invasion. Israel shouldn’t try to just conquer the whole territory, but rather target specifically, in any ground initiatives that it does, Hamas leadership and the people who perpetrated the Oct. 7 attack and anyone else who might be in a position to plan or organize a similar kind of attack. So that may mean ground incursions. It might not. It’s hard for me to say without access to a lot of classified intelligence that the Israelis aren’t sharing with me. But one thing it probably does entail are significant special forces raids inside Gaza. They’re not omnipotent, but they can be much more discriminate in the way that they fight than regular military can be. It means — I mean, this is gruesome to talk about, but an extended assassination campaign targeting Hamas leaders, both in Gaza and elsewhere.

ezra klein

Which they have done before.

zack beauchamp

Correct. Right. So at the end of the Second Intifada, which is in the roughly early mid-2000s, Israel engaged in this concerted effort to kill anyone who it seemed was the Hamas leader. At one point, this had proven so successful that Hamas didn’t want to name whoever their next leader was. They said, we have a new leader, but we won’t tell you who it is because they were so afraid that that person would also be killed by an Israeli bomb or an Israeli bullet. And that did seem to have an effect on Hamas’s violence at that point in time. Basically, there are only so many people who have the skills to plan a terrorist attack. There are only so many people who know how to build bombs. There’s only so many people who are charismatic enough to inspire effective support from underlings. So if you really engage in a significant extended campaign to kill those people, it can have an effect on the ability of that group to plan and execute attacks. It can’t end the group. But here, another good example is what the U.S. actually did do right in Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda is a shadow of itself right now than it was beforehand. The group is not eliminated, but its capacity to pose a threat to the U.S. homeland is dramatically diminished, even with the Taliban in charge of Afghanistan. You can say the same thing about ISIS after the International counterterrorism campaign against them. They don’t really control the territory that they controlled in Iraq and Syria in the past. This can work even if it can’t destroy the group. But what it does — what it really is is a containment strategy rather than actually we’re going to destroy, in the literal sense of destroy, the organization.

ezra klein

Distinguish this a little bit more for me because what I’m hearing is a distinction of degrees not necessarily of kind. This might include a ground incursion, maybe even a ground invasion. When the experts you spoke to say they should do this and not that, how did they draw the line?

zack beauchamp

Well, one way to do it is duration. So Dan Byman, who’s a professor at Georgetown who studies Israeli counterterrorism strategy, told me that they should plan any ground operation to last for at most a matter of weeks, rather than months, or, as one Israeli source suggested, up to 10 years of potential fighting in Gaza. This is an order of magnitude — many orders of magnitude probably — different in terms of the scale of the operation. The objectives are different. It’s not taking out literally everything that the group can do. It’s about degrading its capacity to engage in violence. So rather than destroying the institutions that Hamas has set up to function as a governing entity in Gaza, you target, more specifically, the political and military leadership who ordered the attack. It’s the difference between regime change and counterterrorism. I know I’m using the word — that buzzword to describe it — but I think that’s a really important and, in many ways, intuitive distinction.

ezra klein

What does counterterrorism mean? And honestly, what do any of these paths mean for the hostages? I think it’s important not to forget their existence here, right? Hamas still has — I don’t know the exact number — but a very significant number —

zack beauchamp

Around 200.

ezra klein

— around 200 of hostages who are being held somewhere. They see them as their bargaining chips. How does this speak to the goal of getting them home?

zack beauchamp

Yeah, I mean, it’s a really, really grim situation when it comes to hostages. It’s not clear to me that there is anything that Israel can give Hamas that they’d be willing to pay that can get the hostages back in negotiations. They’re trying right now. There are internationally brokered talks. The U.S. is involved. Qatar is involved as a sort of international Hamas patron. And those need to keep happening. And they obviously are happening in a parallel track to Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, which is ongoing. I wrote in the piece that Israel should try, as best as it can, to get intelligence on where they are and mount rescue operations. I also noted that the prospects of success for that are really dim, in part because of the tunnel stuff we were talking about for a while. When you have this giant confusing warren underneath Gaza, it’s going to be very, very, very hard for Israel to figure out exactly where people are and to get a special forces team in position to actually bring hostages out, that’s logistically difficult for all kinds of different reasons. So it’s awful. It’s less awful than a full-scale ground invasion would be. The reason for that is if you make it seem like Hamas is about to be destroyed fully, they have every incentive to start executing hostages. I can’t say there’s any way to stop that from happening. This is in the nature of Hamas. They specifically designed their strategy around horrific instances of violence in order to terrify and incite disproportionate responses from the Israelis. So it’s — I mean, I don’t think anyone has a good answer to this, honestly. I wish I could give you a better one. No one I spoke to had a solution to this that was anything like satisfying. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

It’s well-reported by now that as part of the tremendous intelligence failure on the Israeli side, they could see Hamas preparing for this assault. They could see Hamas playing its war games and practicing its incursions. And they just didn’t think much of it. They thought that Hamas would never attempt something like this. So whatever Hamas was doing, they didn’t intend to go through with it. They were either trying to threaten Israel or just show that they have capabilities or whatever. But then they actually did do it. That’s what I’ve heard from a lot of Israelis. That the key mistake was thinking that we had pacified Hamas and that Hamas now had responsibilities to the Gazans and was not going to do something like this and incur this kind of wrath. And that’s why they didn’t take them seriously.

zack beauchamp

Yeah, I think there’s two components to that. The first one you just alluded to is deterrence. So Israel has, for a long time, had a policy towards Hamas of what they call mowing the grass, which is Hamas gets strong, it builds up its military, there’s some kind of escalation, they fight an air war, degrade Hamas’s capacity to launch attacks, and the whole cycle starts over. It’s a pretty euphemistic description of what really means lots of people dying. But the Israelis thought that the punishment they’d inflicted on Hamas during these repeated episodes had made it such that they don’t want to do, well, what they just did. And the second thing is that the government had calculated that they had other interests related here that outweighed the potential terrorist threat from Hamas, which they deemed limited. And here, I’m talking specifically about defanging the two-state solution. Benjamin Netanyahu has been a very, very, very long time opponent of any kind of negotiated solution with the Palestinians. Netanyahu even said that this was part of his strategy at a Likud closed door meeting. He said, and I quote, “Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas.” He continues, “This is part of our strategy to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in the West Bank.” Now, this is single source. We don’t know if that’s exactly what he said. But it’s been widely reported that something like that was said at the meeting.

ezra klein

And it’s what they were doing.

zack beauchamp

Yeah, it is what they were doing. The policy — there’s a very good piece by Tal Schneider, who’s a reporter at the Times of Israel, detailing all the different policy mechanisms that were used to pursue this policy. And one of them was, for instance, facilitating monetary payments from Qatar to Hamas that would allow them to stabilize their regime. They had thought that this was a winning strategy for their ultimate geopolitical objective of allowing Israel to continue to colonize the West Bank unimpeded.

ezra klein

So when I was preparing for this conversation, I read this piece by Lawrence Freedman, who is a professor of war studies at King’s College. And he wrote this in the F.T. And this one line has just been ringing in my head, which is that “Israel is trying to develop a military strategy to deal with the Hamas threat while it lacks a political strategy.” Something that it seems everybody told you, too, is that, OK, a counterterrorism operation is one piece of this. But as you were saying around the research in how terrorism ends, a political strategy, something that saps the underlying support for the terrorist group is the only long-term solution.

zack beauchamp

Yes. I think that’s basically correct.

ezra klein

First, at this point, do you agree with Freedman that there is no dominant political strategy in Israel?

zack beauchamp

Yeah, there just isn’t. I mean, up until now there was a strategy of containing Hamas and of propping it up. Just thinking that you can deter them from launching large-scale attacks and it’s a manageable problem. Since that strategy has been blown up — I mean, it’s been blown up since Oct. 7. It’s been a matter of weeks. And Israel has not developed an entirely new national security strategy in weeks. They don’t know what they’re doing, the current government, because they are forced to reconsider every single assumption they had about how to guarantee security for their own population. I mean, there’s just no sense of what should be done in the long-term. There’s a sense of what we need to do immediately among Israelis. But there really is not a broader strategy in place yet.

ezra klein

But is there even one on the shelf? So for a very long time I think the strategy was a two-state solution. Not necessarily agreed on by all Israelis, but that was the international working framework for what everybody was eventually going to do here. And obviously the details of that were very contested. In recent years, that was moved away from. And the facts on the ground moved against that. There are too many settlements. Too little trust between the parties. And I don’t know that there was really a dominant alternative that emerged. But I do think there were things like it. Something I’ve been thinking about is a paper written by Bezalel Smotrich, who is now the finance minister, pretty hard right guy. But he had this big 2017 analysis of what he thought should be done. And it, I think, is a reminder that there were other ideas floating around. So he writes, quote, “Ending the conflict means creating and cementing the awareness, practically and politically, that there is room for only one expression of national self-determination West of the Jordan River, that of the Jewish nation. Subsequently, an Arab state actualizing Arab national aspirations cannot emerge within the same territory. Victory involves shelving this dream. And as motivation for its fulfillment dwindles, so will the terror campaign against Israel.” And his basic prescription in that — I mean, which I think we can fairly call apartheid — is consistent repression. But as the terrorism threat recedes, Israel is governing a large state that includes a number of Palestinian second-class citizens who have better or worse lives, depending on how they are acting. But eventually, their hope for a state is extinguished and either they leave or they settle into the Israeli status quo. And Israel can treat them better under those terms. And that that is a form of a Jewish one-state solution that I’m not saying everybody agreed with. But I don’t know, I think if you look at what Israel was doing, it doesn’t look totally off the path they were on.

zack beauchamp

Yeah. I think people outside of Israel and the policy circles that discuss this underestimate the importance of this paper. They probably never heard of it. But it’s really, I think, very significant in describing what the current government was doing prior to Oct. 7. Not all of Israel or even all of Netanyahu’s different governments, but the current one, which is — I mean, it’s the most extreme right-wing government in Israel’s history.

ezra klein

And he’s in it, notably, Smotrich. He’s finance minister. It’s a big job.

zack beauchamp

Yeah, and not just finance minister. His job has been structured such that he has control over the West Bank policy, basically. So he could determine what was going on in that component of the occupied territories. And one thing that’s really striking about this paper, from our current vantage point, is that he doesn’t talk about Gaza at all. It’s not really a problem for him. He thought that Israel could secure its long-term future by pacifying the West Bank. And you can pacify the West Bank by depriving Palestinians of hope. Now, it turns out every element of that assumption was wrong. We now know, because of Oct. 7, it wasn’t working. But we also know that it’s what he was trying to do. I mean, Israel was moving towards de facto annexation of the West Bank prior to Oct. 7, which means merging Israeli domestic law with the law of the occupied territories. They’ve been kept separate because the notion of the occupation was that it was temporary, that eventually Israel would leave. It wasn’t annexing this land. But under Smotrich and his policies towards the West Bank, we were moving closer and closer towards a formal de facto in the sense of not announced, but formal integration of the laws and formal annexation of the West Bank.

ezra klein

But what choice was there except for that? I mean, I think when people think of the settlements — I mean, just picture in your head what the number is you think live in the settlements in the West Bank. The implication of the term is that it’s modest. It’s 700,000 people.

zack beauchamp

Yeah.

ezra klein

That’s significant. I mean, the idea that Israel is not governing — I mean, they are Israeli citizens obviously. The idea that Israel is not governing them and thus the territory in which they live, a portion of its population that significant, is absurd.

zack beauchamp

Yeah. I mean, there’s an important caveat there, which is that a lot of the settlements and the large population of them live just on the border with Israel proper and really in areas near Jerusalem. They’re functionally suburbs of Jerusalem. And so in most of the peace proposals or the maps that people have drawn up, a lot of those get annexed to Israel in exchange for territorial swaps that are currently Israeli territories going to a Palestinian territory. So those settlements are less of a problem. And they are the main population center. That being said, you’re right on the basics of the situation. I mean, they’re scattered all around. And they’re scattered all around, by the way, by design. The point of the placement of a lot of these settlements is to cut off Palestinian communities from each other. And by that I don’t just mean it’s between them. I mean, because of what Israel has to do to secure settlers who might otherwise be vulnerable to attacks from Palestinian militant groups, you end up creating this situation where it’s extremely difficult for Palestinians to get around, for their communities to be connected. I mean, in one place that I went to outside of Jerusalem, there is one home part of a Palestinian town. It’s a little bit off from the town center, but that puts it directly adjacent to an Israeli settlement. Now, the settlers didn’t want Palestinians coming into their land. So what did the Israeli military do? They built a cage around this house. And they built a walkway that’s all fenced in that connects the house to the village that it’s nominally a part of. So the people who live there have to walk by settlers who are on the outside of what’s essentially their home as a prison and sees them walking by to get into the town. It’s hard to overstate how disruptive the settlement enterprise is for Palestinians. The political barrier to dismantling all of this is figuring out how to get those people out of there. Not logistically, that’s not actually that difficult. It’s surmounting the political opposition to the trauma that it would cause. The disengagement from Gaza was very difficult for Israelis to begin with.

ezra klein

I think the biggest difference in the politics of this issue over the past 20 years is a number of people who now believe the two-state solution is dead. There are no end of pieces in places like foreign affairs where this would not have really been sayable 20 years ago for the exact reason you just said. The number of settlers, the number of people you’d have to pull back into Israel, the amount of political power they have, how politically impossible that looks. There is no two-state solution because even before you get to all these other questions, like right of return and a lot of other things that I think often get ignored in how hard a significant settlement would be, you cannot unwind the settlement growth of the past 20 years. And if you can’t unwind that, there is no land swap that would create a Palestinian state that makes any sense. Now, you’re more optimistic on this. But I’d like to hear why. Because I actually find that quite convincing.

zack beauchamp

Optimistic is the wrong word, right? It’s more that as hard as it seems to get to a two-state solution from where we are right now, it’s that all of the alternatives are even less viable. And you have to go somewhere. Stasis is not possible. I think that’s one lesson of Oct. 7. As horrible as it is, we now know that Israel trying to maintain the kind of relationship it has with Palestinians, both in Gaza and the West Bank, is not durable. In the long run, there will continue to be unpredictable spurts of violence and that will cause something to change. The question is, what is it going to change towards?

ezra klein

But I think it is a conceptual mistake that is very common among people who study any kind of policy to believe that a problem will ultimately end in a solution.

zack beauchamp

Sure.

ezra klein

That there will be some answer that answer the problem. But you can have much more extended misery than I think people tend to believe in policy circles. You can have very complicated muddling throughs. And so the place I have moved to is that I, in some ways, think the whole conversation about one state and two state has become weirdly — it’s like too far, right? You need precursors to just better than this.

zack beauchamp

No, I think that’s right.

So when you talk to people about what are the strategies that could begin to shift the political equilibrium of the conflict in a tactical and specific way, what did they say? Not what could end it all. Like, what could you do, incrementally, slowly, year by year, that might be trust-building, that might begin to pry open doors just a little bit that feel closed now?

zack beauchamp

Yeah, look, I think it’s important to understand that the occupation of the West Bank, which is where most of these changes would happen, is an immensely complicated legal, political, and military institution. It depends on lots of different policies to expand. And you can start changing some of them. You can start rolling some of them back to make life better for ordinary Palestinians, which is, I think, really the key to this political situation is to show Palestinians that there’s a way forward that doesn’t involve violence.

ezra klein

So like what? What could you roll back?

zack beauchamp

So one would be land use policies. A lot of what Israel does right now in the area is to change land regulations such that it’s easy for settlements, or at least easier, for settlers to take over different Palestinian land. And there are a number of specific things. You even see some that are related to national park services that are used as basically pretexts to grab Palestinian land. Another one would be cutting down or dismantling some of the checkpoints that dot the West Bank and that make it hard for Palestinians to move around from one place to another. Cutting down on those would substantially improve the Palestinian economy. The third would be a cash investment. This is a policy that the former Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad pursued, which is a policy of economic development. It didn’t work out for a variety of reasons. It’s not really Fayyad’s fault, in my view. It’s a fault of the sclerotic Palestinian political organization and an Israeli government that really wasn’t very interested in making Palestinian lives a lot better. That’s something international donors could help change. There’s already a lot of money going in. There are better ways to organize that funding. We can go through dozens of different specific, very nitty-gritty specific policies. Or another one — start doing a better job at preventing provocations from right-wing Israelis on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Like going in, storming into Al-Aqsa Mosque and praying ostentatiously, claiming the land, claiming the Temple Mount and the mosque for Jews. That kind of thing has the tendency to really explode tensions between the two groups.

ezra klein

One reason Hamas called their operation Al-Aqsa Flood.

zack beauchamp

Correct, correct. Israel does so much right now that enables the growth of settlements and that really makes life horrible and anger-inducing for a lot of ordinary Palestinians. But one other thing that Oct. 7 has done is discredit Benjamin Netanyahu among the Israeli public. I mean, if you look at every piece of polling data right now on his approval rating, on a hypothetical election, I mean, his numbers have collapsed because Israelis, very rightly, blame him for what happened. They blame his strategy, his approach to Israeli security for what happened. So for the first time in a long time, Israel has been really caught in this political logjam. And for the first time in a long time, it seems as if there could be something new politically that could happen that could actually have a durable base and a large one among the Israeli population.

ezra klein

This speaks to, I think, another very dominant view right now in Israel, which was something people were saying before this, which is given I think credibility after the attacks, which is that Netanyahu and his government were weakening Israel by dividing Israel so profoundly internally over things like the judicial reforms, that the effort to change the character of Israel as a state was something that made it impossible for Israel to keep focus on its actual threats. And I’m curious how you rate where that anger sits now and what that may or may not make possible.

zack beauchamp

I mean, it’s still pretty profound. There are these videos — I don’t know if you’ve seen them. Have you, Ezra, of government ministers getting yelled at by ordinary Israelis?

ezra klein

Yeah, I have.

zack beauchamp

Yeah, so they get screamed at by ordinary Israelis who blame them for what happened. And it’s easy to forget now, given how different the world seems after Hamas’s attack, but Israel had been experiencing the largest protests of its entire history for most of this year against the judicial reform. This was an issue, an attempt really to alter the foundation of Israeli democracy that was vastly unpopular and significantly undercut trust in the government. Netanyahu’s approval ratings were bad before the worst terrorist attack in Israeli history happened under his watch. He’s currently on trial on charges related to corruption, some of which are quite serious. There’s no trust from the Israeli political mainstream. He has a hard core of supporters, but people don’t believe him to be the guarantor of their security or of their country’s prosperity or political future that they thought he once was. So that creates a tremendous opening for there to be some kind of political alternative. Now, what that alternative looks like not quite as obvious. Right now the polling suggests that Benny Gantz, who has joined an emergency coalition with Netanyahu, is the primary beneficiary of public dissent. This makes sense. Gantz is sort of a centrist, center right-type figure, former general, very hawkish on the Palestinian conflict. Not on settlements, though. He’s hawkish — and this is another poorly understood dividing line outside of Israel — the people who are most hardcore about the settlements are not always the people who are most hardcore about responding to terrorist attacks with force. There’s a correlation there but they can be delinked. So Gantz is very, very aggressive when it comes to military attacks. But he is not ideologically committed to settlements. And there’s another person aligned with him, Gadi Eizenkot, former chief of staff of the IDF, who probably would be even more inclined, if given a position of power, to wind down or at least roll back some of what has been done under Netanyahu to entrench Israeli control over the West Bank. So if he’s defense minister, let’s say, we could see a very, very different West Bank policy in the event that politics change as much as polls suggest they’re going to.

ezra klein

And then always our final question. What are three books you would recommend to the audience?

zack beauchamp

So I want to start with “A High Price,” which is Dan Byman’s history of Israeli counterterrorism policy. It’s a little bit dated now and was published about 10 years ago or so. But to my mind, it’s one of the best serious interrogations of what Israel does or what its playbook is for dealing with terrorist groups, where it works and where it doesn’t. I learned a lot from reading Dan’s book. A second book I’d recommend is “The Selected Works of Edward Said,” who’s a famous Palestinian-American intellectual. There’s a lot in there that’s not related to the conflict. But Said is one of the most articulate exponents ever to live of the Palestinian cause. And if you want to understand where Palestinians are coming from and how they feel about Israeli occupation, it’s hard to do better than going to Said’s work. And the third book I’d recommend, since we spent so much time talking about the West Bank, is a book by an Israeli journalist named Gershom Gorenberg called “The Accidental Empire.” And I love Gorenberg’s book because he really traces the history of how settlements emerged, the ways in which Israeli policy facilitated their development, and the ways in which Israeli governments were taken by surprise by what they had allowed to happen, and how settlers themselves pioneered this fundamental transformation to the conflict that was not necessarily, although at times it seemed like it was, part of Israeli strategic design. It’s a really, I think, an essential insight into how things got to the point where they’re at right now.

Amid anticipation of a protracted campaign to eradicate Hamas, Mr. Netanyahu responded to political pressure and formed a unity government that included opposition leaders.

One of its main conditions was the establishment of a “war management cabinet” that would oversee the fighting and dilute the power of far-right politicians in Mr. Netanyahu’s government. Mr. Netanyahu said in a prime-time address on Wednesday that the war cabinet would play a key role in determining when Israel begins a ground invasion of Gaza.

Israel has so far stopped short of the rapid and overwhelming ground assault that many analysts expected. But the imagery, taken on Monday morning by Planet Labs, a commercial satellite company, shows a significant invading force: many groups of dozens of armored vehicles cutting through open fields and amassing in urban spaces.

The image provides the clearest picture yet of how far one the main lines of Israel’s invasion has moved into Gaza and the destruction it has caused. Israeli vehicles are seen as far south as the neighborhood of Al Karama, north of Gaza City. Videos released by the Israeli military had previously shown lines of tanks operating near the border area.

Many nearby buildings appear to have been heavily damaged or completely destroyed by airstrikes. Hundreds of craters from airstrikes and shelling are visible, including in homes and on roads, and apartment blocks have been flattened.

More than 8,000 people have been killed across Gaza, many of them children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, since Israel began launching retaliatory airstrikes in response to the Hamas attack on Oct. 7.

The area shown is one of three directions where Israeli tanks and other vehicles have moved toward Gaza City, the largest city in Gaza. Lines of armored vehicles have been seen on the main road running north to south of Gaza, as well as in the northeastern corner of the strip, in Beit Hanoun.

But Israeli forces have hung back from direct fighting in Gaza City, the largest city, choosing instead to stay on the city’s fringes to delay the most dangerous combat and keep military options open.

In Al Karama, fields and buildings have been razed over the last nine days.

Fields Fields destroyed Tanks or armored vehicles Fields Tanks or armored vehicles Fields destroyed Fields Tanks or armored vehicles Fields destroyed Source: Satellite image by Planet Labs By The New York Times

The destroyed farmland was used to amass dozens of armored vehicles. Extensive tank tracks give a clue of how they are moving around the area.

Farther south, the imagery shows a series of buildings that have been destroyed, alongside additional craters and military vehicles."
16,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-airstrikes.html,"Since Oct. 7, Israel has said it has targeted scores of Palestinian rocket launchers, command centers and munitions factories. It has also used powerful bombs to penetrate the surface in order to collapse a network of tunnels, hundreds of miles long, that armed groups like Hamas have dug deep beneath the territory’s most crowded urban centers.

Even as Israel has used precision weapons, it has maintained a broad definition of what constitutes a military target. Fighter jets wrecked the Islamic University in Gaza because Israel said the campus had been used to train intelligence operatives. They have targeted mosques that Israel says served as weapons depots and operation centers. And they have targeted Hamas commanders in their homes.

The strikes appear to have successfully curbed the groups’ rocket-firing abilities. The Israeli military has not released exact numbers, but there were fewer than 20 air raid sirens across Israel on Wednesday, compared with hundreds during the first days of the war.

Despite that, Israel has continued to pound the enclave. On Tuesday, the Hamas-run health ministry said that 704 people had been killed in the previous 24 hours. If verified, it would be Gaza’s single deadliest day of the war.

For many in Gaza, the high death toll is an indication that Israel is seeking to collectively punish the people of Gaza and not just Hamas, the group that controls the strip and is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union.

To Dr. Yousef Al-Akkad, the director of the European Gaza Hospital, a medical center in southern Gaza, the strikes constitute “an attempt to satisfy the instinct of revenge and vengeance within Israeli society by bringing the number of martyrs to unprecedented levels.”

But the Israeli military says that even after striking scores of rocket launchers, there are still many military targets left — including Hamas leaders and underground bunkers. On Wednesday, it said its forces had assassinated a senior Hamas commander in southern Gaza, and eliminated a Hamas squad that emerged from a tunnel in the north of the enclave."

18,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/nyregion/israel-gaza-kidnapped-poster-fight.html,"Displaying the posters has become a form of activism, keeping the more than 200 hostages seized by Hamas in full view of the public.

But removing the posters has quickly emerged as its own form of protest — a release valve and also a provocation by those anguished by what they say was the Israeli government’s mistreatment of Palestinians in the years before Oct. 7 and since the bombing of Gaza began.

Some of those caught destroying the posters have been condemned on social media. A dentist in Boston and a person in South Florida, among others, have lost their jobs.

The battle has inflamed already tense emotions. And it captures one of the most fervently debated questions of the war: Whose suffering should command public attention and sympathy?

Those who object to the posters have derided them as wartime propaganda. Critics of those tearing them down have characterized the act as antisemitic and lacking basic humanity. Increasingly, the disputes seem to teeter on the brink of violence, a proxy battle for the life-or-death war in the Middle East.

To Nitzan Mintz, one of the artists behind the fliers, watching them go viral in the first place was a shock. Seeing people rip down the posters has revealed what she said was clear antisemitism. “By accident this campaign did more than bring an awareness of the kidnapped people,” she said. “It brought awareness of how hated we are as a community.”

The skirmishes over the posters are both old-fashioned — conducted with paper and tape and bare hands — and very modern. Social media has the power to elevate street-corner disputes into international incidents, and images of people tearing down the signs have clogged the internet in recent days.

In one video taken in Queens and posted on social media, a group of men who say they are not Jewish confront a man who is tearing down posters. “I’m dying to put you in the hospital,” one of them says, adding an expletive.

At Boston University, a young woman caught removing signs appears both determined to defend herself and uneasy about being documented. “Why are you filming?” she asks the man behind the camera. “To show where the hate is coming from on this campus,” he replies.

In yet another video, a man identified by The New York Post as a Broadway producer is seen using scissors to remove a poster from a utility box on West 62nd Street in Manhattan and tossing it into the trash.

Regulations surrounding where fliers are allowed to be posted tend to be made by local governments, and college campuses usually have their own rules, said Tim Zick, a professor of law at William & Mary Law School in Williamsburg, Va.

The salient issue, he said, is one of free expression. “As a matter of free speech, people who oppose the ‘kidnapped’ posters could erect posters of their own, expressing their views,” Professor Zick said.

The video of the Broadway producer was made public on the Instagram account associated with I Love the Upper West Side, a community news site in New York owned and operated by Mike Mishkin.

Mr. Mishkin said he had been “flooded” with videos and photographs showing people tearing down posters. He has included about a half dozen on his two local news websites. “I’ve gotten more than I could possibly share,” he said.

While Mr. Mishkin, who is Jewish, has not published the names of people included in these images, he knows that other news media outlets and digital platforms will sleuth them out and make them public. He does not feel badly about it. “If they don’t want to be caught doing it, they should have thought of that first,” he said.

He dismisses the excuses that have been shared online — that people are taking the posters down because they’re illegally posted on public property or because people want to clean up their neighborhood.

“I don’t think they’re ripping down posters of ‘Dan Smith Will Teach You Guitar,’” he said.

In fact, the motivations of those removing signs take a variety of forms. And as unnerving as the removal of the posters has been for some Jews and supporters of Israel, at least some of the people tearing them down are Jewish themselves.

Miles Grant, 24, takes down posters in New York “occasionally,” he said in a telephone interview. “It’s the lack of context that gets me,” said Mr. Grant, who said he is Jewish and a self-described “pro-Palestinian who is not a Zionist.”

“It’s so obvious that they don’t care about people’s lives,” he said of those putting up the “kidnapped” posters.

If they did, he said, the posters would include details explaining the history of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. “Why did this happen and what are the events that led to this happening? That is what’s missing, and I think it’s intentional.”

He said he had felt concerned at times that he would end up in a viral video, but he has not let that deter him. “I think they’re putting them up to bait people to take them down,” he said. “I think it’s disgusting how they’re trying to destroy people’s lives.”

A woman in Brooklyn, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she said her family would be upset by the publicity, said she had torn down “kidnapped” posters after a friend in a group chat for activists encouraged her. The posters, she said the friend told her, amounted to anti-Islamic war propaganda.

“So I said, ‘Cool beans, let’s take them down.’”

Ms. Mintz, one of the artists behind the posters, described her campaign as a way for Jews to deal with their own fear in a dark time. “The way we can express our worry over the kidnapped is to put up the poster, so that we don’t punch a wall or commit suicide,” she said.

She and her partner, Dede Bandaid, work with teams of volunteers who roam New York putting up the posters. “People do it because they are very stressed and very worried and very scared,” she said.

She said that they had permission from the relatives of the hostages featured on their posters, and that family members had often contacted them to request that they make a poster to include their kidnapped loved ones.

Criticism of the posters is creating dissension within the progressive Jewish community. Last week, Rafael Shimunov, a Jewish peace activist affiliated with a street art group called Art V War, posted a lengthy video on Instagram in which he considers the reasons some people put up the posters, including “public mourning,” and others take them down.

He did not endorse the removal of the posters, but said that the people putting them up should also create posters of Palestinians who are missing. The posters “don’t include Palestinians, so are they concerned about missing people?” he asked.

In the video, as he walks around the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn talking to the camera, he says that the area has few posters up, except for in front of a Palestinian restaurant.

“These posters are being used to target Palestinians in our community,” he says, concluding: “When you’re reflexively attacking the people taking them down, maybe try to understand why they’re taking them down.”

And, he says, some people putting the posters up may have benign motives, too — while for others, “the plan is to foment war.”

On a Jewish social justice listserv, Rabbi Amichai Lau-Lavie, an Israeli-born New Yorker, called Mr. Shimunov’s video “an abomination.” “We can do better than tearing down our family’s pleas for redemption, while at the same time fighting to prevent Palestinian bloodshed and horror,” he wrote.

In the past week, adaptations of the signs have emerged — some subverting the original intent of the posters and some supporting them.

On the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Councilwoman Julie Menin spotted a poster that looked like the originals — but instead of the word “Kidnapped,” it said “Occupier,” bearing an image of a young girl with the caption: “Ella Elyakim, 8 year old Israeli.” “This is unacceptable,” Ms. Menin commented on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

At the corner of Broadway and 96th Street last weekend, half-ripped posters were covered with small fliers that said: “Why are the posters of kidnapped Israelis being ripped down? Because they don’t want you to know the truth.”

And on Wednesday in New York, a group of 238 Holocaust survivors plan to gather and pose for a portrait organized by the Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation. Each survivor will hold a “Kidnapped” poster, drawing a sharp connection between the horrors of World War II and the current conflict.

On Long Island, Guy Tsadik has found a way to ensure that the posters stay up. With friends and relatives, he has gone door-to-door through the towns of Cedarhurst, Hewlett, Inwood, Lawrence and Woodmere and asked store and restaurant owners to display the “kidnapped” posters inside windows that face the street. He has friends doing the same in New Jersey and Florida.

“This way it is not possible to deface or remove them,” Mr. Tsadik said.

19,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-invasion.html,"Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has vowed to “demolish Hamas.” Without sharply defining what that means, he pledged to remove the group from Gaza after its Oct. 7 attack on Israel killed 1,400 people and led to the kidnapping of more than 200 others.

But Gaza, heavily urbanized, with Hamas deeply entrenched, is an especially complex battlefield. Concerned about the challenges ahead, the Biden administration has sent senior military officers to provide advice to the Israelis, based on their own experiences in Iraq, while pressing Israel to delay the invasion, to leave more time to negotiate the release of hostages taken by Hamas and to deliver more humanitarian aid. American officials worry that Israel lacks a plan with clear, achievable objectives that would prevent an enormous loss of life among Gaza’s more than two million Palestinian civilians.

“I’ve encouraged them to conduct their operations in accordance with the law of war,” Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said on Sunday.

With history as a guide, three factors would most likely shape a ground war in Gaza’s cities: the urban environment, the interaction between fighters and civilians, and political pressures.

The Landscape

The Gaza Strip is about 140 square miles, a narrow band slightly larger in area than Las Vegas, with a cluster of urban population centers. Gaza City, the capital, has around 700,000 people packed into around 20 square miles, with more tall buildings than U.S.-led forces faced in the battle for Mosul, creating a more dangerous three-dimensional front.

Many urban invasions — from the Middle Ages to modernity — have started off with a rapid advance, only to later bog down in districts that favor defenders. Mosul is a prime example; another is last year’s siege of Mariupol. A few thousand Ukrainian soldiers held the city for nearly three months against an advancing Russian force five to eight times as large.

“They leveraged the city’s heavy-clad, industrial buildings and its subterranean network very effectively,” John W. Spencer, chair of urban warfare studies with the Modern War Institute at the U.S. Military Academy, wrote in a report about the first year of the Ukraine war.

Cities can also be malleable. Israel has destroyed hundreds of Gaza buildings in airstrikes. Hamas, long before its assault on Israel this month, had built hundreds of miles of tunnels under Gaza City that can be used to move between attack positions, hide hostages and protect supplies."
20,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/opinion/israel-gaza-war-smotrich.html,"While the world’s eyes are on Gaza, another drama is unfolding in Jerusalem. There, lawmakers and government ministers are tussling over how to pay for the war against Hamas. There’s a debate over how much, if any, of the money should come from special allotments that were made earlier this year to the ultra-Orthodox and to settlers in the West Bank.

Eight days after the murderous Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, Bezalel Smotrich, the radical rightist who serves as finance minister in the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said at a news conference that he had issued instructions to change the order of budgetary priorities. At the time, he didn’t seem to exempt so-called coalition funds, much of which are earmarked for the ultra-Orthodox and the settlers. Coalition funds are an obvious potential source for the war effort because they’re not required for the basic operations of government.

More recently, though, Smotrich has shown little interest in diverting funds intended for the ultra-Orthodox and the settlers to pay for the war and for aid to displaced civilians. “There really isn’t a lack of money,” Smotrich said, according to an article in TheMarker, a business daily published by Ha’aretz. Pressed on whether some war funding would come from the ultra-Orthodox and the settlers, he said, “At least in the war, let’s put populism aside.”

Smotrich’s seeming protection of the special allocations to the ultra-Orthodox and the settler movement isn’t likely to sit well with many Israelis. Impatience with those two groups was rising even before the war. It’s likely even stronger now."
21,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/us/politics/desantis-israel-antisemitism.html,"Bryan Griffin, press secretary for the DeSantis campaign, said that Mr. DeSantis had shown his commitment to protecting both Israel and American Jews through his actions, calling him “a leader who acts and delivers.” He did not comment on the conversations with the donors.

This week, however, one of Mr. DeSantis’s closest Jewish allies, State Representative Randy Fine, broke with the Florida governor and switched his endorsement to Mr. Trump. Mr. Fine wrote in an opinion column that Mr. DeSantis’s failure to confront antisemitism more publicly had “broken my heart.” In an interview with The New York Times, he said he had been dismayed by Mr. DeSantis’s “lack of leadership” after the neo-Nazi marches.

“Look, if you can’t say Nazis are bad, which should be the easiest thing in the world to say, then what are you doing?” said Mr. Fine, who is the only Jewish Republican in the State Legislature and was publicly confronted by a neo-Nazi protester this month. “It’s important, because Jews are scared.”

Mr. Fine said the governor’s silence was both “stubborn” and “wrong.”

In response to a reporter’s question this week, Mr. DeSantis defended himself, calling the neo-Nazi demonstrators “knuckleheads” and asking why he would “elevate that nonsense” by drawing attention to them.

“I think some of them are fake,” the governor said at a campaign stop in New Hampshire. “I think they’re just trying to get media clicks.”

He also accused Mr. Fine, who is running for the State Senate, of playing “pure politics” with his endorsement.

In contrast to Mr. DeSantis, Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, both Republicans, have condemned neo-Nazi activities in Florida.

After one incident last year, Mr. Rubio wrote on social media that antisemitism was a “dangerous poison” that must be condemned “everywhere & every time, even when it’s just a small group of attention craving losers” — a seeming rebuke of Mr. DeSantis.

Many leaders of prominent Jewish groups agreed with Mr. Rubio’s assessment. Sarah Emmons, the Florida regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, told The Times this week that “public officials should call out antisemitism and hate in all forms across the political spectrum, no matter the source.”

Both the governor’s office and his presidential campaign said he had responded to the incidents with deeds rather than words, pointing to legislation he has signed that bolstered religious anti-discrimination protections in schools, increased penalties for antisemitic harassment and financed security at Jewish day schools. The governor has also directed state law enforcement agencies to pursue neo-Nazis for illegal demonstrations.

“Action to protect the Jewish community and hold those who break the law accountable is more important to the Governor than giving these demonstrators the wall-to-wall coverage they (and the media) crave,” Jeremy Redfern, the press secretary in the governor’s office, said in a statement.

In one high-profile antisemitic incident that took place in February, Rabbi Yosef Konikov was surrounded by neo-Nazi protesters as he attempted to drive from the Chabad he leads in Orlando. The men shouted slurs and threats. Mr. Konikov described the encounter — which was caught on video and was not his first run-in with the group, he said — as “disturbing.”

But he said he believed the governor had been right not to speak publicly about what happened.

“I don’t want these guys to get more coverage than they are already getting,” explained Mr. Konikov, who said he has attended Hanukkah celebrations at the governor’s mansion. He also said that Mr. DeSantis’s office had called him privately to offer support.

Mr. DeSantis’s Jewish supporters believe the governor has made it abundantly clear where he stands through his legislative agenda and his full-throated backing of Israel."

Ms. Tripoli, who is based in London, oversees the Times photography coming out of Israel and Gaza. She said her team takes great care when deciding whether to publish a graphic image, weighing the newsworthiness of the photograph and considering the dignity of those pictured.

If the editors decide that a photograph should be published, they then discuss its placement in an article. Does the photo appear next to the headline, where it will immediately confront the reader? Or should it be placed a few paragraphs down in the text, so as not to disturb someone who isn’t expecting it? Should it be used to accompany posts on social media?

Below are four photographs taken by freelance photojournalists who are covering the war for The Times. Sergey Ponomarev, a Russian photojournalist, and Avishag Shaar-Yashuv, an Israeli photojournalist, are in Israel. Samar Abu Elouf and Yousef Masoud are Palestinian photojournalists in Gaza. In email exchanges and phone calls, they provided context that goes beyond the frame to Times Insider. Mr. Masoud and Ms. Abu Elouf’s accounts have been translated from Arabic. — Terence McGinley"
23,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/world/middleeast/israel-rescue-soldier-abducted-hamas.html,"The Israeli military said on Monday that it had rescued an Israeli soldier who was abducted from an Israeli army base on Oct. 7 and taken to Gaza during the Hamas-led terrorist attacks in Israel.

The soldier, Pvt. Ori Megidish, 19, was rescued between late Sunday night and early Monday morning, during the military’s ongoing invasion of Gaza, according to a military spokesman, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus. He declined to say where exactly she had been held, but said she was in good physical and mental health.

More than 220 hostages were captured by Hamas and other groups on Oct. 7. Ms. Megidish is the first to be rescued alive by the Israeli military, Colonel Conricus said. Four other hostages have been released by Hamas.

She was abducted after Hamas gunmen overran and briefly captured a military base in Nahal Oz, just east of the northern Gaza Strip, where she served as a field observer, according to Ynet, an Israeli news outlet. Field observers watch for threats along the Gaza border by analyzing video filmed by cameras positioned along the border fences.

After providing the Israeli security services with useful information during a debrief, she returned home on Monday to her family in Kiryat Gat, in southern Israel, Colonel Conricus said.

Video posted on social media showed her being celebrated at a joyous family gathering that included the playing of a shofar, a Jewish ceremonial horn."

sabrina tavernise

From The New York Times, I’m Sabrina Tavernise. And this is The Daily. [MUSIC PLAYING] Almost immediately after Israel was attacked on October 7th, it began preparing for a ground invasion of Gaza. But more than two weeks later, that invasion hasn’t happened. Today, I talk to Jerusalem Bureau Chief Patrick Kingsley about why. It’s Wednesday. October 25th. So Patrick, it’s 6:30 in the evening in New York, and it’s 1:30 in the morning where you are in Israel. We know you’ve had a really long day. Tell us where we’re reaching you right now and what you’ve been doing.

patrick kingsley

You’re reaching me on the road between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. I’ve spent the last nine hours watching security camera footage from a kibbutz in the South called Kibbutz Be’eri, where more than 100 people were killed on October 7th during the Hamas terrorist attacks. And I’ve been trying to research exactly what happened that day to try and piece together the events of the day. And it’s been a long few weeks, as it has for everyone here, Israelis and Palestinians.

sabrina tavernise

It has been a long and horrible few weeks. And I wanted to call you, Patrick, because I wanted to hear what you had to say about the next few weeks, the next phase. And the thing that’s really been a central focus, I think, for everyone and certainly in our coverage, has been a ground invasion. That was something that we were hearing about really from the very first days after this horrific attack on Israel. And we keep hearing that it is about to happen and it is imminent. There are currently tens of thousands of troops amassed at the Southern border with Gaza. We’ve had colleagues there, photographers taking photographs of tanks arrayed in fields, really contributing to this feeling that this thing is about to happen, right? But it hasn’t. So let’s start to unpack the reasons why.

patrick kingsley

Well, one reason why they might be delaying is the fact that there are more than 200 mostly Israeli hostages now in captivity in Gaza. It’s believed that most of them are being held underground in Hamas’ network of subterranean fortifications. And there are intense negotiations going on, not directly between Hamas and Israel, because they don’t have formal relations. But mediated by Qatar, and to some extent, Egypt. There are talks to try and get some of them out. And we’ve already seen four released. There were two — mother and daughter were released a few days ago and then yesterday. Two elderly women were released to the Egyptians over the border between Egypt and Gaza. And there have been reports that maybe there could be 50 more on the way in the coming days. Reports of maybe women and children could be released. None of these have been confirmed. But while those negotiations still have a chance of liberating some of the people who’ve been captured, it is thought that Israel is holding back from a ground invasion, lest it harm the chances of winning those people’s freedom.

sabrina tavernise

And as we know, getting hostages out is pretty complicated. It takes time. So hostages is one of the reasons for the wait.

patrick kingsley

It’s one of the factors. But there are others. One is that if Israel invades Gaza, it is feared that that will then open up a second front with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia that dominates Southern Lebanon, which is allied to Hamas. And Hamas is backed by Iran. So there’s a fear that they might get involved even more than they already have done. Then there’s the fact that Hamas is very well dug in underneath its stronghold of Gaza City. It has hundreds of miles of tunnels that it’s burrowed away over the last decade and a half. And it’s very hard to get to them there, and it’s very easy for their fighters to pop up through openings in the ground and ambush the incoming Israeli army. And there’s a sense that this could become a kind of urban quagmire, cause huge loss of life to Gazan civilians, and to the Israeli ground forces going in and trying to edge their way towards Hamas’ stronghold in Gaza City.

sabrina tavernise

Right. I mean, cities are notoriously impossible to conquer, right? And Gaza is this extremely densely populated place. Armies go in, they get stuck. I mean, this is something that the Americans experienced in Iraq, in Fallujah in 2004, and in the northern city of Mosul in 2016. I know that our colleagues in Washington have been talking to American officials and Tuesday morning in the paper had a big story about how American officials were actually quite worried that the Israeli military wasn’t prepared for this. Hadn’t quite taken onboard just how difficult this fight would be and might not be ready for it. How does that factor in?

patrick kingsley

Well, I think that’s not only an American concern. There’s talk in Israel that the Israeli army needs to gather more intelligence about exactly where different Hamas fighters and different Hamas fortifications are situated. And there’s a sense that also Israel isn’t in a rush. It doesn’t need to charge in immediately. And the extra time, though nerve wracking for its forces, it also gives them more time to train. Remember that a lot of the people that are massed on the Gazan border are reservists who’ve been called up, several hundred thousand of them. And I think crucially, it gives the Air Force more time to try and take out Hamas fighters and tunnels from the air. There are some who think maybe they’re trying to clear certain routes, creating a kind of corridor or corridors that will allow their troops to enter Gaza and reach the center of Gaza City via slightly less obstructed route.

sabrina tavernise

And of course, there’s another layer to the planning here, and we also know this from Iraq. And that’s of course the question of, if you do go in, what do you do after that? Do you actually try to run it?

patrick kingsley

That’s the million dollar question. Because if and when Israel does retake the Gaza Strip, it’s going to have to decide whether it wants to govern the enclave as it did between 1967 and 2005, or whether it wants to relinquish control of it, at least nominally, to some other party. It cannot do that to Hamas. The whole point of going in is to destroy Hamas. And then that probably leaves the Palestinian Authority, which is the Palestinian body that administers parts of the occupied West Bank. But if it did that, the Palestinian Authority would face a real crisis of legitimacy, because it would be perceived by many Gazans as having rode back to power on the back of an Israeli tank. And it may find it would lose control of the enclave as quickly as it did in the 2000s, when it was given control of Gaza for two years between 2005 and 2007 before being forced out by Hamas. So yes, there are the hostages. Yes, there are fears over a second front opening up with Lebanon. But also there’s the big question of, what will Israel do with Gaza after it captures the territory? And it’s a difficult choice. And that is what we presume is partly why Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli leader, he’s taking his time to issue an invasion order.

sabrina tavernise

Yes. As you say, ultimately, that decision, the decision of whether to invade and all of the consequences it brings, rests with one man.

patrick kingsley

Yes. Benjamin Netanyahu. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. So Patrick, bring me inside the calculations of Benjamin Netanyahu at this moment. I mean, initially, of course, he declared there would be an end to Hamas with this great urgency. And now there’s what appears to be a delay in the ground invasion, one of the principal ways that he would reach that objective. How does he see all of this?

patrick kingsley

I think the first thing to remember is that historically, he’s always been quite bad at making big decisions. He tends to prevaricate and delay and try and push things off until the next day. We’ve seen that all this year with his domestic policies. Very controversial plan to overhaul the judiciary. No one’s ever really been sure what exactly his plan has been. His plan is seen to change on a day by day basis. And that also seems to be the case with this planned invasion of Gaza. But in a sense, that’s Netanyahu’s trademark. He pushes off big decisions until the very last moment. And partly that’s because it is a big decision. If he goes in, there could be a big loss of life or Israeli soldiers, just as there will be an even bigger loss of life for ordinary Palestinians in Gaza. And he knows that that will bring pain to a lot of Israelis, a lot of voters. And it’s not a decision that he or any Israeli leader is going to take lightly. There’s another factor that some political analysts have been talking about, which is that the failure of October the 7th, the collapse of the Israeli military defenses in the South, ultimately, in many people’s eyes, is on him. The buck stops with the prime minister of the day. And he is the Israeli leader who presided over that failure. And so while Israelis are relatively united at the moment because it’s a war and because they’ve just experienced this huge trauma of October 7th, after the war, it will be a completely different case. There’s bound to be a national inquiry. And that probably isn’t going to look good for the people who are in charge, and that includes Netanyahu. It could collapse his government. That would then lead to a new election. And if the current situation remains the same, then he would struggle to win that election. And he’d be out of power. So there are some people who think that he’s in no rush to start a ground invasion. Because the sooner the invasion begins, the sooner the war ends. And the sooner the war ends, the likelier it is that there will be a threat to his political power.

sabrina tavernise

So in other words, the decision is also a political one for Netanyahu. I mean, potentially a matter of his political survival.

patrick kingsley

Yes. And that’s partly why he was keen to bring in members of the opposition into his government. A couple of weeks ago, he formed a unity government, bringing in some members of the centrist opposition, including two former senior generals that gave his cabinet more experience, more military heft. But it also meant that he can spread responsibility. Whatever happens now is not just going to be on him. It’ll also be on those two generals who he brought into his war cabinet. And that’s both a security minded decision, but it’s also being construed by some analysts as a very political decision. Because after the war and when assessments are made of how the war went, he won’t be alone on the stage in front of critics who will be analyzing his performance.

sabrina tavernise

And Patrick, what is the public sentiment here? I mean, is there a chomping at the bit to invade? How does the Israeli public see this?

patrick kingsley

I think the bottom line is this polling shows that a majority of Israelis do support a ground invasion. And there’s a sense that after what Hamas did on October 7th, there’s no way that Israel could really countenance keeping us in its leadership on their doorstep. But underneath that headline, there’s a lot of nuance. For a start, there’s a small and not particularly vocal minority that doesn’t want to invade at all. And even among the people that do want an invasion, there are a mixture of positions. There are certainly those that sound very vengeful. There are people on the far right who are calling for the expulsion of all Palestinians from Gaza. But then there’s also probably a much bigger group that just wants to get rid of Hamas and is wary of the pain and loss that a ground invasion will bring. It will be bloody. It will likely involve great loss of life, mostly on the Palestinian side. But also for the Israeli soldiers. And all across Israel, there are families, probably the majority of families, that have someone who is at the front or preparing to go to the front. And those families know that their loved one might not make it back. And so the whole conversation about an invasion is tinged with a sense of necessity, but also a sense of anxiety and danger.

sabrina tavernise

And in the meantime, the Israelis have launched this relentless series of airstrikes over Gaza. You’ve been reporting on that. Tell us what you’re learning, Patrick. What are you hearing in your reporting?

patrick kingsley

I think the bottom line is it’s the most intense Israeli bombing campaign on Gaza, ever. The military said today that they had hit 7,000 targets in Gaza in just over 2 and 1/2 weeks.

sabrina tavernise

Wow, 7,000 targets.

patrick kingsley

Exactly. And the Hamas run health ministry in Gaza said yesterday that nearly 6,000 people had died during that bombing campaign. That isn’t a figure that we’ve been able to verify. But if it’s anything close to it, then it’s quite a staggering number. Whole neighborhoods have been leveled, including in the wealthier parts of Gaza City. Areas that typically have not been damaged or only lightly damaged in previous rounds of conflict between Hamas and Israel. Israel says that it only targets militants and military infrastructure. And that any civilian loss of life is because the militants Hamas burrowed themselves into civilian areas in order to give themselves human shields. But to Palestinians, the bombing campaign, Israel’s bombing campaign, feels like it’s targeting civilians themselves, because there has been such a high death toll across civil society. Medical workers killed, journalists killed, bombs on marketplaces, mosques, and so on. And coupled with that is a rising humanitarian crisis that has been set off by Israel’s siege of Gaza. It’s cut off water, it’s cut off electricity. It’s cut off almost all food supplies. And it’s encouraged hundreds of thousands of Gazans to move from the north of the strip to the south, which means that Southern Gaza is very, very overcrowded. People are scavenging, essentially, every day to find food and water. And life has become extremely difficult for Palestinians in Gaza. Not that it was easy before the war, but it’s been taken to another level now.

sabrina tavernise

So Patrick, is there a risk here with these civilian casualties mounting and this deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, that the longer the airstrikes continue, the more Israel risks losing support for its ground offensive?

patrick kingsley

I think that’s about right. In the opening days of this particular conflict, Israel had just experienced what its president has called the bloodiest day for Jews since the Holocaust. And it felt like there was broad global support, particularly from leaders if not citizens for Israel taking essentially defensive action against the group that had enacted all these massacres in Southern Israel, Hamas. But as time has gone on and the air raids have increased and the loss of life in Gaza has grown and grown and the narrative has shifted away from the villages that were raided in Southern Israel earlier this month to the crowded urban areas of Gaza where thousands of Palestinians have been killed in bomb strikes, as a result, you’re starting to see different messages come out from global leaders, one in which they talk about Israel needing to respect international law, avoiding loss of civilian life. You’re not quite seeing Western leaders coming out strongly against an invasion in and of itself. But there seem to be more qualifiers and qualifications attached to the West’s expression of support for Israel. And that rhetorical shift may accelerate and morph into something stronger. For example, an outright rejection of an Israeli invasion of Gaza.

sabrina tavernise

So Patrick, there have been a lot of comparisons in recent days to the US after 9/11. And this idea that the US was in this fog of anger and emotion after the attack and made some real strategic errors in the wake of it, namely, invading Iraq. Has this come up at all in your reporting as you’re talking to Israelis, people in the government, Israeli citizens? Is anybody talking about Israel and how it might be about to make a strategic mistake if it does this ground invasion?

patrick kingsley

I think that the 9/11 comparison has been made frequently, both in Israel and outside. And to begin with, I think Israelis thought it was a useful comparison to make. Because by comparing it to 9/11, they could convey to the world just what a big deal it was for terrorists to come and slaughter around 1,400 Israelis, many of them in their homes. But as time has gone on, it’s taken on a double meaning. Because as you say and as Joe Biden has said, what America did in the aftermath of 9/11 in the heat of its emotion was not necessarily the wisest, including the invasion of Iraq and the quagmire that that became. And certainly there are plenty of people in Israel and outside who acknowledge that making decisions in the heat of the moment is not the best plan. But at the same time, other people say, well, hang on, Iraq was thousands of miles away from America. But Gaza is right on Israel’s doorstep, and it doesn’t have the luxury of not taking the threat of Hamas seriously. It has to do something. And far from being irrational and emotional to respond to what Hamas has done, it’s actually the most logical thing, to try to remove this organization that just led these bloody massacres in Southern Israel. And then there’s another group of people that zoom out even further. And they’re looking beyond what happens if you root out Hamas. And they’re saying it’s all very well to get rid of Hamas, but if you don’t have a wider plan not just for who runs Gaza, but what to do about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, how to address the long running challenges and imbalances that have created this conflict, then a certain point down the line, there’s going to be just another explosion and a repeat. And the cycle will go on and on.

sabrina tavernise

So Patrick, from everything you’ve said, there are, of course, enormous risks if Israel goes ahead with a ground invasion. But there’s also an enormous human toll if Israel continues with these airstrikes while they delay. But is there also a third way that we’re not talking about here, which is just calling it off? Is there any chance that that’s where we’re headed? That a ground invasion may not happen at all.

patrick kingsley

It’s always possible. And people are voicing that suggestion a little bit more vocally than they were a few days ago. But I think if Israel didn’t launch a ground invasion, many Israelis would see that as a capitulation to a group that’s just killed 1,400 Israelis in a single day. That sets a bad precedent. That makes Israel seem weak and would cause them a massive loss of face. So the idea that Israel would not respond to something of that magnitude and would just call off a ground invasion and let the group that perpetrated that massacre remain on its doorstep feels a little bit hard to believe. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

So does this mean we’re going to be in this place for a while? Anticipating a ground invasion with really no end in sight of these airstrikes?

patrick kingsley

Well, anything’s possible. But us reporting on the ground certainly aren’t standing down anytime soon ourselves. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

Patrick, I don’t hear the sound of the car behind you. You’re home.

patrick kingsley

Yes, that’s right. I am home, and I’m looking forward to going to bed.

sabrina tavernise

I’m going to let you go to do that. Thank you so much, Patrick, for talking to me.

patrick kingsley

Thank you, Sabrina. Speak soon.

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] Here’s what else you should know today. A third lawyer who tried to help Donald Trump overturn the results of the 2020 election has pleaded guilty in a Georgia racketeering case and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors building a case against Trump. The lawyer, Jenna Ellis, now joins Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesbrough in flipping on Trump. In a tearful statement to the court, Ellis said she regretted her involvement in Trump’s campaign to steal the election.

25,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/world/europe/israel-reservists-hamas-war.html,"Made up largely of veterans and reservists, the group that calls itself Brothers in Arms started nine months ago as a protest movement against the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It helped to organize giant weekly demonstrations against his plans to give the government unprecedented control over the judiciary. And many of its members vowed that they would not serve in the army if called.

But everything changed after Hamas brutally attacked Israel on Oct. 7. Not only did the reservists show up for duty, but Brothers in Arms has also transformed into the largest nongovernmental aid agency in Israel to help those affected by the war.

It is helping the military secure protective vests and helmets. It is feeding and clothing some of the perhaps 60,000 Israelis displaced from the area near Gaza after the Hamas assault. It is providing therapy to some and feeding the livestock and picking the produce of others, as well as opening a center to take care of abandoned dogs.

It has worked with A.I. experts and volunteers to comb videos and social media accounts to try to verify whom Hamas took as hostages and work out who survived and who did not. It has also provided any intelligence it can gather to the Israeli military.

But the more the group is seen positively by the Israeli public, the more those who support Mr. Netanyahu and his policies see it as a growing political force, even a threat."
26,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/world/middleeast/gaza-internet-blackout.html,"It was increasingly difficult to reach people in the Gaza Strip or know what was happening in the enclave late Friday as Israel said it was stepping up its bombardment and staging another incursion.

On Friday evening, two major Palestinian mobile networks, Jawwal and Paltel, said that their phone and internet services were down. Some Palestinians who have managed to communicate with the outside world said that fear and panic were spreading.

Reached by WhatsApp, Belal Khaled, a Palestinian freelance photographer, described the scene among residents at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, saying, “People are in fear, and they feel they are in limbo. They don’t know what’s happening around them.”

Visuals from inside Gaza on social media channels monitored by The New York Times and some wire services were extremely limited on Friday afternoon. Reuters maintained a live camera directed from the Israeli side of the border toward the Gaza skyline that showed darkness with an occasional burst of light. There were few images available of what was happening on the ground."
27,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-invasion.html,"Israeli troops and tanks fought their way deeper into the northern Gaza Strip on Tuesday, according to Israeli and Gazan officials, who described battles with Hamas fighters and troop movements drawing closer to the territory’s main city and the warren of tunnels beneath it.

The Israeli military said it had attacked a base of Hamas, the group that controls Gaza, and “eliminated dozens of terrorists, anti-tank launching squads, anti-tank launching positions” and observation posts, and had “seized many weapons, including explosives.” The claims could not be immediately verified.

The two sides gave conflicting accounts of a deadly Israeli airstrike in the Jabaliya community north of Gaza City, site of a long-established and densely populated refugee camp, where photographs taken on Tuesday showed at least one large blast crater that was not present in earlier satellite images, and significant damage to buildings.

The Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry said that the strike had killed and wounded hundreds of people. Dr. Marwan Sultan, medical director of the nearby Indonesian Hospital, said there were dozens dead and his facility had received hundreds of injured patients. The figures could not be verified.

The Israeli military said the strike had killed a Hamas commander who was a key plotter of the Oct. 7 assault on Israel that the Israeli authorities say killed more than 1,400 people and captured more than 200 hostages.

The commander, Ibrahim Biari, was actively directing attacks against Israeli targets from a “vast underground tunnel complex,” Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman for the Israeli military, said in a late-night briefing. He said that in Israel’s estimation, “dozens” of Hamas combatants were killed along with him when the underground complex imploded.

Hamas denied that any of its commanders were in the area of the strike."
28,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/us/politics/democrats-israel-gaza.html,"Israel’s war against Hamas is exposing deep divisions among Democrats in Congress, as the most outspoken supporters of the Jewish state and vocal pro-Palestinian members on the left trade accusations of bigotry and feud over what role the United States should play in the hostilities.

The tensions burst into the open last week after 15 House Democrats drew rebukes for refusing to vote for an overwhelmingly bipartisan resolution that declared solidarity with Israel and condemned Hamas.

The situation is expected to escalate this week as the House debates an emergency $14.3 billion spending bill to provide security assistance for Israel. It will also consider a separate Republican-written resolution to censure Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan and the only Palestinian-American member of Congress, for participating in a pro-Gaza rally this month at the Capitol, where she accused Israel of committing genocide.

The schism reflects a broader split inside the Democratic Party, where a left-leaning coalition of younger voters and people of color are breaking with President Biden over this staunch support of Israel, and primary battles are brewing between strong defenders of the Jewish state and progressives who promote Palestinian rights.

On Capitol Hill, the divide has been exacerbated by Republicans, who are eager to exploit the rift among their political rivals. Speaker Mike Johnson plans to hold a vote this week pairing a bill to fund Israel’s war effort with cuts to the I.R.S. that were a key part of Mr. Biden’s sweeping climate and health care law, a tough pill for Democrats to swallow. And some left-wing Democrats think Mr. Biden should have requested more humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians in his proposed emergency spending plan.

The House also is expected to vote as soon as Wednesday on the measure to formally censure Ms. Tlaib, who has harshly criticized Israel and expressed skepticism of U.S. intelligence findings that Israel was not culpable for a recent hospital bombing in Gaza. At the rally at the Capitol, she pleaded for a cease-fire, saying, “We are literally still watching people commit genocide and killing a vast majority just like this, and we still stand by and say nothing.”

The measure, which is sponsored by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, accuses Ms. Tlaib of “antisemitic activity, sympathizing with terrorist organizations and leading an insurrection” at the Capitol.

Even the most pro-Israel Democrats appear disinclined to back Ms. Greene’s resolution.

“The language is extreme and over the top,” said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, noting that the measure falsely refers to the pro-Gaza rally and sit-in, which was organized by Jewish antiwar groups, as an “insurrection.”

Several other Democrats scoffed at the idea that a lawmaker who once compared coronavirus mask and vaccine mandates to the treatment of Jews by Nazis during the Holocaust and promoted a conspiracy theory that space lasers controlled by Jews were responsible for wildfires in California, as Ms. Greene did, could credibly accuse a colleague of antisemitism.

But Ms. Wasserman Schultz said she had “deep concerns” that Ms. Tlaib was engaging in “inflammatory conduct” and savaged Democrats who have refused to condemn Hamas.

“I understand there are usual suspects that are not pro-Israel, that object to Israel’s policies, but we should all be against slaughter,” she said, referencing the 1,400 civilians and soldiers killed and 222 hostages seized when Hamas raided Israel. “If you’re not against slaughter, you don’t have a soul.”"
29,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/us/politics/trump-republicans-colleges-israel-hamas.html,"As tensions mount on U.S. college campuses over the war in Gaza, several Republican presidential candidates are proposing a crackdown on students and schools that express opposition to Israel, appear to express support for the deadly Hamas attacks or fail to address antisemitism.

Former President Donald J. Trump, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina have called for the federal government to revoke international students’ visas, while others have suggested that universities should lose public funding.

After students at George Washington University projected messages on Tuesday onto the side of a campus building — including “Glory to our martyrs,” “Divestment from Zionist genocide now” and “Free Palestine from the river to the sea,” a phrase that encompasses all of Israel as well as Gaza and the West Bank — two candidates argued almost immediately that the students or the universities, or both, should be punished.

“If this was done by a foreign national, deport them,” Mr. Scott wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Wednesday morning. “If the college coddles them, revoke their taxpayer funding. We must stand up against this evil anti-Semitism everywhere we see it — especially on elite college campuses.”

Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota wrote: “Antisemitism cannot be tolerated. Period. The students responsible should be held accountable and if the university fails to do so it should lose any federal funding.” He indicated in another post that he would “fully enforce” a Trump-era executive order to use Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to revoke federal funding for any university that “enables” antisemitism.

They and other Republicans are wading into an emotional debate on college campuses over Hamas’s attack on Israel, Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict — turning the opinions of individual students and student groups, starting at Harvard and New York University, into national flash points. Days of simultaneous pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel demonstrations have exposed painful divisions, including significant and potentially consequential ideological rifts between donors, students and faculty members.

The suggestion of punishing anti-Israel views is part of a broader campaign against liberal-leaning campus environments, which many Republicans claim indoctrinate students. But it is also in tension with other parts of that campaign: In many cases, the same candidates have previously condemned what they described as censorship of students who expressed conservative opinions.

Mr. Scott was a co-sponsor of a Senate resolution in 2021 that called on colleges and universities to “facilitate and recommit themselves to protecting the free and open exchange of ideas” and argued that “restrictive speech codes are inherently at odds with the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.”

Mr. Burgum signed legislation in North Dakota, also in 2021, that forbade universities in the state to discriminate against student organizations or speakers based on their viewpoint.

When asked where Mr. Scott drew the line between protected and unprotected speech, his campaign did not comment on the record but cited a previous statement in which he called it a “fine line.” Mr. Burgum’s campaign pointed to the Trump executive order as requiring action.

Separately, on Tuesday, the chancellor of the State University System of Florida wrote in a letter to university presidents that he had determined — “in consultation with” Mr. DeSantis — that two campus chapters of the group Students for Justice in Palestine “must be deactivated.”

The national Students for Justice in Palestine organization released guidance to campus chapters earlier this month calling for demonstrations “in support of our resistance in Palestine.” The guidance called Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which killed more than 1,400 people, “a surprise operation against the Zionist enemy” and “a historic win for the Palestinian resistance.”

It added, “This is what it means to Free Palestine: not just slogans and rallies, but armed confrontation with the oppressors.”

The letter from the chancellor, Ray Rodrigues, said the chapters had violated a Florida law against providing “material support” to “a designated foreign terrorist organization.”

“The State University System will continue working with the Executive Office of the Governor and S.U.S.’s Board of Governors to ensure we are all using all tools at our disposal to crack down on campus demonstrations that delve beyond protected First Amendment speech into harmful support for terrorist groups,” it said. “These measures could include necessary adverse employment actions and suspensions for school officials.”

The national Students for Justice in Palestine organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The letter came a few days after Mr. DeSantis declared at a campaign event in Iowa that, if elected president, he would revoke the visas of students who supported Hamas. He did not say how he would determine who fell into that category; some public commentary has applied the label “pro-Hamas” to demonstrators expressing broader support for Palestinians or opposition to Israel’s military actions in Gaza, which have killed more than 6,500 people, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. (Its figures could not be independently verified.)

Mr. Trump made the same proposal at his own recent event in Iowa, also not providing details. “Under the Trump administration, we will revoke the student visas of radical anti-American and antisemitic foreigners at our colleges and universities, and we will send them straight back home,” he said.

Nikki Haley, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, joined Mr. Scott and Mr. Burgum in saying she would cut federal funding to colleges that did not condemn students who supported Hamas.

“No more federal money for colleges and universities that allow antisemitism to flourish on campus,” Ms. Haley wrote on X, arguing that the promotion of certain opinions in relation to the Hamas attack constituted “threatening someone’s life” and was “not freedom of speech.”

Only one candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy, publicly rejected efforts to punish schools or individual students for anti-Israel or pro-Palestinian statements.

“Colleges are spaces for students to experiment with ideas & sometimes kids join clubs that endorse boneheadedly wrong ideas,” he wrote on X this month in response to an uproar over a letter from student groups at Harvard that held “the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.”

He added: “It wasn’t great when people wearing Trump hats were fired from work. It wasn’t great when college graduates couldn’t get hired unless they signed oppressive ‘DEI’ pledges. And it’s not great now if companies refuse to hire kids who were part of student groups that once adopted the wrong view on Israel.”"
30,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/world/middleeast/israel-erdan-yellow-star-of-david.html,"The head of Israel’s Holocaust memorial on Tuesday criticized the country’s ambassador to the U.N. for wearing a yellow Star of David patch during an address to the Security Council, saying the symbol, which was used under the Nazis to identify Jews, dishonors both the country and victims of the Holocaust.

Dani Dayan, chairman of Yad Vashem museum in Jerusalem, said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that “the yellow patch symbolizes the helplessness of the Jewish people when we were at the mercy of others” and that Israelis should instead display the country’s blue-and-white flag as a sign of strength.

The Nazis ordered Jews to wear the yellow star badge during the Holocaust as an identification mark, to single them out for isolation and harassment and to widen the rift between Jews and other members of society, according to Yad Vashem.

Israel’s U.N. ambassador, Gilad Erdan, wore the badge during a speech at an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council on Monday in New York in which he accused the council of failing to condemn Hamas for the Oct. 7 attack that killed about 1,400 people in Israel.

He said the lack of a formal condemnation by the council was reminiscent of a broader international failure during World War II to speak out against the Holocaust.

In the speech, in which he noted that his grandfather had died at Auschwitz, Mr. Erdan vowed that he and his team would wear yellow stars “from now on,” saying that “from this day on, each time you look at me, you will remember what staying silent in the face of evil means.”

Mr. Erdan then pinned a six-pointed yellow star with the words “never again” in capital letters on his left breast. Aides sitting behind him also donned the badge.

Mr. Erdan did not immediately respond to Mr. Dayan’s criticism.

The Security Council has struggled to come up with a unified response to the Israel-Hamas war, with rival resolutions failing to pass last week in a sign of the deep divide as Israel bombards the enclave in retaliation for the Hamas attack.

Russia and China vetoed a resolution put forth by the United States that did not demand a cease-fire and that also supported Israel’s right to self-defense. A resolution put forth by Russia called for a cease-fire, but did not pass after failing to receive the nine votes required."
31,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/us/politics/jacob-lew-confirmed-israel-ambassador.html,"The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Jacob J. Lew as the next U.S. ambassador to Israel, filling a post that the Biden administration has argued is critical to efforts to help the country as it seeks to topple Hamas in the Gaza Strip and ward off additional challenges from other Iran-linked groups in the region.

The 53-to-43 vote reflected a deep partisan divide over whether Mr. Lew, who served as Treasury secretary during the Obama administration, was the right man for the job. Only two Republicans, Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky, joined all Democrats in backing Mr. Lew’s confirmation.

Mr. Lew’s confirmation comes as Congress is rushing to respond to Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza with a comprehensive package of emergency military and humanitarian assistance. President Biden has requested a $105 billion national security spending package for the war efforts in Israel and Ukraine, as well as threats in the Indo-Pacific and along the U.S.-Mexico border.

The task has been complicated by partisan divisions between the Democratic-led Senate, which is working to fulfill Mr. Biden’s request, and the Republican-led House. The new speaker, Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, has chosen instead to put forward a security assistance bill for Israel alone and package it with a provision to roll back an I.R.S. enforcement initiative that was part of Mr. Biden’s deficit reduction measure.

Though Mr. Biden nominated Mr. Lew before the war broke out, the urgency surrounding his confirmation has increased as the hostilities between Israel and Gaza have escalated. But while Republicans acknowledged the need to install a Senate-confirmed ambassador to the post, they rallied against Mr. Lew’s candidacy, arguing that his work promoting and carrying out a multinational nuclear pact with Iran during the Obama years had rendered him an untrustworthy interlocutor with Israel.

Republicans and Israeli officials vehemently opposed the Iran deal, which eased certain sanctions in exchange for Tehran giving up its nuclear ambitions, when it was struck in 2015. President Donald J. Trump later withdrew the United States from the pact.

“A vote for him is a vote to subvert, not strengthen, our ally in its time of need,” Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said of Mr. Lew on the Senate floor.

“He lacks either the nerve or the will to really stand up for Israel when it really matters and the chips are down, as they are today,” Mr. Cotton added.

Democrats have consistently defended Mr. Lew, insisting that his conduct as Treasury secretary was above reproach and that his support for Israel is undeniable.

“Mr. Lew has a strong, long, proven record as a strong public servant and ferocious ally of Israel,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, said on the floor on Tuesday. He also asserted that “the need to confirm Mr. Lew is plain and irrefutable: Israel is in crisis, America needs to stand with her, and a most urgent and obvious step would be to ensure that we have an ambassador in place.”

Republicans argued that Mr. Lew acted beyond his authority to try to ingratiate Iran into the international banking system by leaning on banks to do business with Tehran. They also accused him of trying to funnel money into Iran’s coffers and of working to undermine Israel’s interests at the United Nations.

“The underlying problem here is our policy and policies toward Iran,” said Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee. He argued that given Iran’s key role as a financier of Hamas and other groups in the region challenging Israel, “the last thing we need is somebody who is very contrary to our view on how Iran should be handled.”

Democrats said the Israelis themselves backed Mr. Lew.

“They are very much looking forward to having a confirmed ambassador from the United States in Jerusalem to help in regards to the challenges they’re now facing as a result of Hamas’s terrorist attack in Israel, and they’re very much looking forward to Jack Lew being that ambassador — they told us that directly,” said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland and the chairman of the foreign relations panel.

He added that Mr. Lew’s experience working on prisoner releases could prove critical as the United States seeks to free American and Israeli hostages being held by Hamas."
32,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/world/europe/israeli-hamas-middle-east-implications.html,"The sudden and unexpected terror attack by Hamas into Israel has been a crushing blow to a host of assumptions that have defined the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for years.

Israelis compare the invasion and deaths of some 1,400 Israelis, most of them civilians, to the toll of Sept. 11, 2001, in the United States. And they compare the shocking surprise of the Hamas attack both to Sept. 11 and the Yom Kippur War of 1973, when Israeli forces were unprepared for an Arab attack led by Egypt and Syria that also exploded widely held assumptions.

Here are four paradigms now in shatters:

Hamas could be contained and the conflict managed.

For many years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel carried out a strategy designed to split the Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza. He worked to weaken the power of the Palestinian Authority, the governing body led by President Mahmoud Abbas, by allowing Hamas to retain control over Gaza.

The theory was that Hamas, supported financially by Qatar, would concentrate more on governing the enclave, and might become more moderate through that responsibility, while also ensuring that it did not hit Israel so hard as to engender a huge military response that would undermine its rule. The conception, as the Israelis like to call it, was to allow Gazans to live better and thus incentivize Hamas to maintain relative calm.

In practice, that meant Israel allowed Qatar to fund the Hamas government, while providing essentially free electricity and enough water, food and medicine for people to get by. Israel allowed a small number of Gazans to work in Israel, but, with Egypt, kept most of the population locked inside what many called “an open air prison.”"

This week, a dramatic public battle has been playing out between the United Nations, Israel and the United States. On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council voted down two competing resolutions on the Israel-Hamas war. These votes came one day after Israel called for the U.N. secretary general to resign in response to his comments that the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, while appalling, “cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.”

Against this backdrop, families of Israeli hostages spoke at the U.N. on Tuesday. One of those relatives was Alana Zeitchik, whose six cousins are among the hostages still being held in Gaza. Today, we hear from Ms. Zeitchik about why she decided to speak to the international body and her view of the U.N.’s role in this conflict.

Just as the United States would not agree to a cease-fire after the bombing of Pearl Harbor or after the terrorist attack of 9/11, Israel will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas after the horrific attacks of Oct. 7. Calls for a cease-fire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism. That will not happen.

35,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/business/media/ai-muddies-israel-hamas-war-in-unexpected-way.html,"Far more attention was spent on suspected footage that bore no signs of A.I. tampering, such as video of the director of a bombed hospital in Gaza giving a news conference — called “A.I. generated” by some — which was filmed from different vantage points by multiple sources.

Other examples have been harder to categorize: The Israeli military released a recording of what it described as a wiretapped conversation between two Hamas members, but what some listeners said was spoofed audio (The New York Times, the BBC and CNN reported that they have yet to verify the conversation).

In an attempt to discern truth from A.I., some social media users turned to detection tools, which claim to spot digital manipulation but have proved to be far from reliable. A test by The Times found that image detectors had a spotty track record, sometimes misdiagnosing pictures that were obvious A.I. creations, or labeling real photos as inauthentic.

In the first few days of the war, Mr. Netanyahu shared a series of images on X, claiming they were “horrifying photos of babies murdered and burned” by Hamas. When the conservative commentator Ben Shapiro amplified one of the images on X, he was repeatedly accused of spreading A.I.-generated content.

One post, which garnered more than 21 million views before it was taken down, claimed to have proof that the image of the baby was fake: a screenshot of AI or Not, a detection tool, identifying the image as “generated by AI.” The company later corrected that finding on X, saying that its result was “inconclusive” because the image was compressed and altered to obscure identifying details; the company also said it refined its detector.

“We realized every technology that’s been built has, at one point, been used for evil,” said Anatoly Kvitnitsky, the chief executive of AI or Not, which is based in the San Francisco Bay Area and has six employees. “We came to the conclusion that we are trying to do good, we’re going to keep the service active and do our best to make sure that we are purveyors of the truth. But we did think about that — are we causing more confusion, more chaos?”

AI or Not is working to show users which parts of an image are suspected of being A.I.-generated, Mr. Kvitnitsky said.

Available A.I. detection services could potentially be helpful as part of a larger suite of tools, but are dangerous when treated like the final word on content authenticity, said Henry Ajder, an expert on manipulated and synthetic media.

Deepfake detection tools, he said, “provide a false solution to a much more complex and difficult-to-solve problem.”

Rather than relying on detection services, initiatives like the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity and companies like Google are exploring tactics that would identify the source and history of media files. The solutions are far from perfect — two groups of researchers recently found that existing watermarking technology is easy to remove or evade — but proponents say they could help restore some confidence in the quality of content.

“Proving what’s fake is going to be a pointless endeavor and we’re just going to boil the ocean trying to do it,” said Chester Wisniewski, an executive at the cybersecurity firm Sophos. “It’s never going to work, and we need to just double down on how we can start validating what’s real.”

For now, social media users looking to deceive the public are relying far less on photorealistic A.I. images than on old footage from previous conflicts or disasters, which they falsely portray as the current situation in Gaza, according to Alex Mahadevan, the director of the Poynter media literacy program MediaWise.

“People will believe anything that confirms their beliefs or makes them emotional,” he said. “It doesn’t matter how good it is, or how novel it looks, or anything like that.”"
36,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/world/europe/israel-hamas-gaza-war.html,"As Israeli soldiers have massed to enter Gaza in force, the defense minister has promised them, “You see Gaza now from a distance; you will soon see it from inside.”

Yet despite this vow from the minister, Yoav Gallant, it is not clear when Israel will mount a ground invasion. And if the government appears hesitant to enter Gaza — more than two weeks since the Hamas attack that killed more than 1,400 Israelis — there are good reasons to be.

What lies ahead is a kind of sustained urban warfare that the country’s military forces have not encountered for nearly a decade, and in pursuit of a political end that remains unclear aside from vanquishing Hamas, which controls Gaza, so that it can never again threaten Israeli citizens.

By itself, that is a tall order that will require the Israelis to establish control over Gaza for themselves, and one which will cost significant amounts of blood, treasure and international outrage over civilian deaths.

And hovering over everything is the political conundrum of what happens to Gaza after the war ends. Once in, how does Israel get out? Once it has dismantled Hamas, if it can, to whom will it hand the keys? If Hamas no longer governs Gaza, who will?

For the moment, Israeli officials say, those questions are not their immediate concern. But they will be unavoidable, even if Gaza becomes the responsibility of a new Israeli government."
37,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/opinion/biden-israel-trip.html,"President Biden flew into multiple headwinds on his risky trip to show solidarity with Israel on Wednesday. Even before his plane landed at Ben Gurion Airport, several allied Arab leaders announced they would not see him. He won a limited agreement from Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza but secured no promises that Israel would follow his urgent request to respond to the terrorist attack by Hamas with deliberate care and concern for the preservation of civilian life, rather than rage. He offered a small aid package for residents of Gaza and the West Bank but can’t do much more until Congress functions again.

Rocket and shell fire from Gaza and Lebanon resumed within two hours after his plane left Israel.

But the trip was still worth making, as much for what went unspoken as for any tangible goals that were achieved. The president’s decision to enter a war zone, in a country full of destruction and rage and the smoke of explosives, made it clear that the United States still has a vital role to play in defusing international crises and protecting democracies.

And that’s especially true, given the dysfunction on display back in Washington during his visit. While Mr. Biden met with Israeli emergency workers and the families of victims of Hamas, Republicans in the House were distinguishing themselves by not electing a speaker, by not doing their jobs in passing spending bills and military aid packages and by not demonstrating that the legislative branch of government has its act together.

In the Senate, a single Republican member, seething about abortion, is preventing the promotion of hundreds of military officers at a time when American military expertise could be extremely useful around the world. Jack Lew, as strong a supporter of Israel as anyone ever nominated for the position of ambassador to that country, faced a torrent of opposition on Wednesday to his nomination from a group of Republican senators still annoyed that he helped put in effect the Obama administration deal that required Iran to limit its uranium enrichment."
38,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/opinion/israel-hamas-ceasefire.html,"I am watching the Israel-Hamas war and thinking about one of the world leaders I’ve most admired: Manmohan Singh. He was India’s prime minister in late November 2008 when 10 Pakistani jihadist militants from the Lashkar-e-Taiba group, widely believed to be linked to Pakistan’s military intelligence, infiltrated India and killed more than 160 people in Mumbai, including 61 at two luxury hotels. What was Singh’s military response to India’s Sept. 11?

He did nothing.

Singh never retaliated militarily against the nation of Pakistan or Lashkar camps in Pakistan. It was a remarkable act of restraint. What was the logic? In his book “Choices: Inside the Making of India’s Foreign Policy,” India’s foreign secretary at the time, Shivshankar Menon, explained, making these key points:

“I myself pressed at that time for immediate visible retaliation” against the jihadist bases or against Pakistani military intelligence, “which was clearly complicit,” Menon wrote. “To have done so would have been emotionally satisfying and gone some way toward erasing the shame of the incompetence that India’s police and security agencies displayed.”

He continued, “But on sober reflection and in hindsight, I now believe that the decision not to retaliate militarily and to concentrate on diplomatic, covert and other means was the right one for that time and place.”

Chief among the reasons, Menon said, was that any military response would have quickly obscured just how outrageous and terrible the raid on Indian civilians and tourists was; “the fact of a terrorist attack from Pakistan on India with official involvement on the Pakistan side” would have been lost. Once India retaliated, the world would immediately have had what Menon called a “ho-hum reaction.” Just another Pakistani-Indian dust-up — nothing unusual here.

Moreover, Menon wrote, “an Indian attack on Pakistan would have united Pakistan behind the Pakistan Army, which was in increasing domestic disrepute,” and “an attack on Pakistan would also have weakened the civilian government in Pakistan, which had just been elected to power and which sought a much better relationship with India than the Pakistan Army was willing to consider.” He continued, “A war scare, and maybe even a war itself, was exactly what the Pakistan Army wanted to buttress its internal position.”

In addition, he wrote, “a war, even a successful war, would have imposed costs and set back the progress of the Indian economy just when the world economy in November 2008 was in an unprecedented financial crisis.”"

And progressive organizations are girding for possible challenges to Representatives Cori Bush of Missouri, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and others, funded from the deep pockets of AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups.

“They spent a historic amount of money to intervene, and try and buy primaries in 2022,” said Usamah Andrabi, spokesman for Justice Democrats, the liberal insurgent group that helped elect many of the progressives now on the primary target list. “I think we will see a doubling and tripling down, because no one in the Democratic leadership is trying to stop them.”

Officially, AIPAC is neutral for now.

“There will be a time for political action, but right now our priority is building and sustaining congressional support for Israel’s fight to permanently dismantle Hamas,” said the group’s spokesman, Marshall Wittmann.

But AIPAC’s jabs have already begun. Responding to a post by Mr. Bowman extolling his “Ceasefire Now” resolution, the lobbying group called it “a transparent ploy to paint Israel as the aggressor and allow Hamas to control Gaza.” Hitting Ms. Lee, AIPAC wrote on X, “Emboldening a group that massacres Israelis and uses Palestinians as human shields will never achieve peace.”

Waleed Shahid, a former leader of Justice Democrats, predicted that the current environment, in which leaders of both parties, including President Biden, are aligned with Israeli leadership and the Palestinian cause is represented by protesters in the streets and on college campuses, would yield a trove of fund-raising for pro-Israel groups ahead of 2024. He suggested that there may be an “asymmetrical” fight during the primaries.

“I think we’re in a post-9/11 environment where there’s a lot of fear to speak out against war, and there could be political electoral consequences for not lining up for the cause of war, the way there was in 2002,” he said.

Progressive Democrats like Ms. Lee have other constituents to consider, including progressive Jews who remain by her side. Avigail Oren, a nonprofit professional in Pittsburgh, said that the Tree of Life attack led her to conclude that Jewish safety rested with securing the safety of all vulnerable communities, especially those targeted by white supremacists. That propelled her to work toward Ms. Lee’s election, she said, and her support for the congresswoman “was reinforced, not shaken” by the events in Israel, which she said underscored the need for an Arab-Jewish-Muslim alliance.

Ms. Lee said Jews were “10 percent of our district, but we also have Muslim, Arab, Palestinian constituents who are afraid for their families and their lives.”"

Within an hour of the blast on Tuesday night, the Hamas-run Gazan health ministry accused Israel of attacking the Ahli Arab hospital, a medical center in Gaza City where scores of families had been sheltering. The allegation was soon denied by Israel but quickly accepted and amplified by Arab leaders across the Middle East, setting off unrest throughout the region. The claim was widely cited by international news outlets, including The New York Times, before Israel issued its denial.

But in the days since, as new evidence contradicting the Hamas claim has emerged, the Gazan authorities have changed their story about the blast. Spokespeople have released death tolls varying from 500 to 833, before settling on 471.

The Hamas-run health ministry has also declined to release further details about those 471 victims, and all traces of the munition have seemingly vanished from the site of the blast, making it impossible to assess its provenance. Raising further questions about Hamas’s claims, the impact site turned out to be the hospital parking lot, and not the hospital itself.

On Sunday, Hamas turned down requests by The Times to view any available evidence of the munition it said had struck the hospital, claiming that it had disintegrated beyond recognition.

“The missile has dissolved like salt in the water,” said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, in a phone interview. “It’s vaporized. Nothing is left.”

Salama Maroof, the head of the Hamas-run government media office, said in a text message: “Who says we’re obligated to present the remnants of every rocket that kills our people? In general, you can come and research and confirm for yourself from the evidence we possess.”

For Palestinians, the accusation of Israeli responsibility for the blast has cemented the perception that Israel’s response to the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7 has been disproportionate and vengeful. The Hamas-run Gazan health ministry says that Israeli strikes have killed more than 4,300 Palestinians, 40 percent of them children, and the high reported death toll has undermined international support for Israel’s counterattack."

But on Friday, he did not show any hesitation as he grabbed the megaphone at a cease-fire rally back home in the New York City suburbs to demand what only a dozen other members of Congress have: that both Israel and Hamas lay down their arms.

He condemned Hamas’s brutal murder of 1,400 Israelis. He condemned the governments of the United States and Israel for facilitating what he called the “erasure” of Palestinian lives. And with Palestinian flags waving, Mr. Bowman said, “I am ashamed, quite ashamed to be a member of Congress at times when Congress doesn’t value every single life.”

Forget about retreating to safer political ground. In the weeks since Hamas’s assault, Mr. Bowman, an iconoclastic former middle-school principal with scant foreign policy experience, has repeatedly inserted himself into the center of a major fight fracturing his party’s left between uncompromising pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian factions."
46,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/arts/artforum-editor-fired-david-velasco-palestine-gaza.html,"One of the art world’s top magazine editors was fired Thursday night after the publishers of Artforum said that the staff’s decision to post an open letter about the Israel-Hamas war failed to meet the organization’s standards.

The editor in chief, David Velasco, said he had been terminated after six years as Artforum’s leader. He had worked at the publication, considered among the world’s most prestigious art magazines, since 2005.

“I have no regrets,” Velasco said in an email. “I’m disappointed that a magazine that has always stood for freedom of speech and the voices of artists has bent to outside pressure.”

Thousands of artists, academics and cultural workers, including Velasco, signed the Oct. 19 open letter, which supported Palestinian liberation and criticized the silence of cultural institutions about the Israeli bombing of residents in Gaza.

The letter initially omitted mention of Hamas’s surprise Oct. 7 attack, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis, information that was added after criticism from subscribers and advertisers. A preface was also added to say that the letter “reflects the views of the undersigned individual parties and was not composed, directed or initiated by Artforum or its staff.”

It is not clear who wrote the letter. In it, the signatories “call for an end to the killing and harming of all civilians, an immediate cease-fire, the passage of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and the end of the complicity of our governing bodies in grave human rights violations and war crimes.”

The magazine’s publishers, Danielle McConnell and Kate Koza, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a post on the magazine’s website Thursday evening, they criticized the decision as “not consistent with Artforum’s editorial process.” The letter “was widely misinterpreted as a statement from the magazine about highly sensitive and complex geopolitical circumstances,” they said in the post, which made no mention of Velasco’s termination.

“Our publication has a proud history of advocacy,” they added. “That the letter was misinterpreted as being reflective of the magazine’s position understandably led to significant dismay among our readers and community, which we deeply regret.”

The Oct. 19 open letter met condemnation, drawing responses by figures in the art world. On WhatsApp, campaigns were organized to dissuade advertisers from working with the magazine.

“I think it was a complete betrayal of their readers,” Michael Phillips Moskowitz, a curator and collector, said. “It was characterized by hubris with no understanding of what led to this moment.”

Several prominent artists later removed their names from the Oct. 19 letter, but it remained popular among many of the people who signed it, including those who said that the intention was to advocate peace.

“Tampering with the opinions of artists is to not understand the role of art,” said Cecilia Vicuña, a Chilean poet and artist who signed the letter, adding that she valued “the right to freedom of speech.”

Velasco joined Artforum in 2005 as an editorial assistant and became editor in chief in 2017 when the magazine’s leadership was accused of ignoring issues of misconduct amid a sexual harassment lawsuit against its publisher at the time, Knight Landesman. The claims against Landesman were dismissed, and accusations that Artforum had retaliated against an employee were settled outside of court.

Velasco had to rebuild trust in the publication’s brand and was largely successful, restoring Artforum’s reputation as an authoritative source of art world intrigue and criticism.

Before Velasco was fired, some artists defended him in a letter to Jay Penske, the mogul behind Penske Media Corporation, which recently acquired Artforum, saying that Velasco had “established a fearless and uncompromising vision for the magazine.”

“David’s leadership at Artforum is needed now more than ever,” the letter said."
47,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/arts/dave-chappelle-israel-hamas.html,"Dave Chappelle was about 24 minutes into his set on Wednesday night in Raleigh, N.C., when he briefly touched on remarks he had made about the Israel-Hamas conflict at a show in Boston last week that had led to cheers, some walkouts and headlines.

“Right now, I’m in trouble because the Jewish community is upset,” Mr. Chappelle told a packed crowd of more than 20,000 people at PNC Arena. “But I cannot express this enough: No matter what you read about that show in Boston, you will never see quotation marks around anything I said. They don’t know what I said.”

“It’s all hearsay,” said the comedian, who, like many others, requires audience members to surrender their smartphones at shows.

Mr. Chappelle, a satirist whose reputation for diving into polarizing topics has increased in the latter stages of his comedic career, returned to the Israel-Hamas conflict near the end of his set Wednesday.

“The other night, I said something about Palestine in Boston and got misquoted all over the world,” Mr. Chappelle said. “And I will not repeat what I said.”

A woman in the crowd responded by shouting, “Free Palestine.”

“Please, please, miss,” Mr. Chappelle responded. “Listen. Don’t start it up or I’m going to be in the news cycle for another week. This thing that’s happening in the Middle East is bigger than everybody.”

“This is what’s happening and, believe me, I understand what’s happening in Israel is a nightmare,” Mr. Chappelle said. “What’s happening in Palestine is a nightmare.”

He continued: “There’s only two kinds of people in the world: people who love other people and the people that have things to make them afraid to love other people. Pray for everyone in Israel. Pray for everyone in Palestine.”

“And remember that every dead person is a dead person,” he said, calling the situation a “tragedy.”

At the show last Thursday in Boston’s TD Garden, Mr. Chappelle was drawn into speaking about the conflict by members of the audience. He raised concerns about how a group of Harvard students had been treated since signing an anti-Israel letter, condemned the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas and criticized Israel for its role in causing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, according to remarks first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The Los Angeles Times reported that perhaps 200 people in the roughly 17,000-person audience in Boston had departed toward the end of the show.

A few minutes after initially discussing the interaction on Wednesday, Mr. Chappelle noticed a commotion stemming from the arena’s upper level. “That still might be the Jews coming for me,” said Mr. Chappelle, who has often used his penchant for causing offense as fodder for jokes.

He urged for someone in the crowd to call emergency medical responders before being reminded that audience members did not have their phones. He said he had never thought about what would happen without them in an emergency.

“Sorry,” Mr. Chappelle said, stretching out the word. “I don’t want the Jews to know what I said.”

On Wednesday night, Mr. Chappelle, wearing a red, black and gray flannel shirt with cutoff sleeves and taking frequent drags from a cigarette, filled his set with jokes about Madison Cawthorn, a pro-Trump former North Carolina congressman and material about transgender people that has drawn widespread criticism. He also joked about being attacked onstage last year by an armed man while performing at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.

The audience cheered him loudly, and the hour-and-15-minute set did not appear to have caused the kind of walkouts that marked the Boston show."
48,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/briefing/gaza-israel-biden-netanyahu.html,"President Biden landed in Israel this morning as the world waited for evidence of whether a Hamas-linked group or Israel caused a devastating explosion yesterday at a hospital in Gaza City.

The explosion, evidently from a missile, killed hundreds of people and injured hundreds more. (This video, verified by Times journalists, shows the moment the blast destroyed the hospital.)

Both Israeli and Palestinian officials blamed the other side for the carnage. Gazan health authorities said it was an Israeli airstrike. Israeli officials said it was a failed rocket attack by Islamic Jihad, an armed group aligned with Hamas.

After Biden landed, he seemed to endorse Israel’s denial of responsibility. “Based on what I’ve seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you,” he said. “But there’s a lot of people out there not sure.”"

And we will ensure Israel has what it needs to defend itself against these terrorists. That’s a guarantee. Hamas does not represent the vast majority of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip or anywhere else. I want to thank the Israeli, the Israelis and the Palestinians, excuse me, and President Sisi of Egypt, for working with the United States to make sure that food, water and medical supplies are getting through to innocent people in Gaza. The flow needs to increase, and we’re working very hard with our partners to make that happen.” “Australia unequivocally condemns the terrorism of Hamas. We grieve for the loss of every innocent life, whether that be Israeli or Palestinian. Today, I announce that Australia will provide an additional $15 million in humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza. This adds to the $10 million Australia has already committed, and will help deliver life-saving assistance, such as emergency water, and medical services.”"
50,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/world/middleeast/yemen-houthi-militia-israel.html,"Yemen’s Houthi militia claimed an attempted attack on southern Israel on Tuesday, saying it had launched a “large batch” of ballistic and cruise missiles as well as drones toward Israeli targets.

The Iran-backed militia carried out the attempted assault in response to what it called “brutal Israeli-American aggression” in Gaza, the Houthi military spokesman, Yahya Sarea, said on the social media platform X. Mr. Sarea said the attack was the third operation conducted by the Houthis “in support of our persecuted brothers in Palestine,” and threatened further missile and drone assaults.

The Times could not independently verify the Houthi claims.

On Tuesday, the Israeli military said its aerial defense system had intercepted a surface-to-surface missile fired toward Israel “from the area of the Red Sea.” It said it had also intercepted other “aerial threats” in the area, none of which entered Israeli territory.

The Israeli military did not say who was behind the attacks. But a senior official in the U.S. Department of Defense, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Israeli military had intercepted missiles launched from Yemen that had a range of around 1,200 miles.

Yemeni analysts said the attack, despite being thwarted, demonstrated the expanding capabilities of the Houthis, an Iran-backed militia that took over the Yemeni capital, Sana, in 2014. After an unsuccessful attempt by a Saudi-led military coalition to rout it, the group now rules much of northern Yemen. It has also become an important arm of Iran’s so-called “Axis of Resistance,” which includes the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and armed groups in Iraq.

“The Houthis stepping into the battlefield, even in a symbolic manner, sends a clear message to Israel — an unmistakable indication that a new force has emerged against it in the region,” said Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group. Diversifying the source of attacks on Israel is a key strategy for the Axis of Resistance that is “designed to confound Israel and deter the broadening of its ground military operations in Gaza,” he said.

Support for the Palestinian cause and hostility toward Israel has long been a pillar of the Houthi narrative. Since the Israeli military began its bombardment of Gaza — responding to the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, the Iran-backed armed group that controls Gaza — Houthi leaders have issued repeated threats to enter the fray. Last week, Abdulaziz bin Habtour, prime minister of the Houthi government, said the Houthis might attack Israeli ships in the Red Sea.

In 2015, when the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen began, the Houthis didn’t even have the capability to carry out drone strikes, said Farea al-Muslimi, a research fellow at Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa program. But in the years that followed, they built up their capacity, with Iranian support.

Last year, attacks claimed by the Houthis in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi — more than 700 miles from northern Yemen — killed three people.

Israel has begun to see the Houthis as a threat in recent years, said Daniel Sobelman, a research fellow at Harvard Kennedy School’s Middle East Initiative who focuses on Iran’s Axis of Resistance. In 2020, Israel deployed Iron Dome batteries near the southern town of Eilat after it assassinated a top Iranian nuclear scientist, “fearing that the retaliation would come from Yemen,” he said.

Even the potential of Houthi attacks on southern Israel means that “Israel must now allocate capabilities that otherwise would have been used elsewhere,” Mr. Sobelman said.

But the extent to which the Houthis present serious risks to Israel is unclear, Mr. Nagi said.

Despite the growth in their military capabilities, the Houthis control a deeply impoverished territory torn apart by war. The Israeli military, in contrast, maintains high-tech air defense systems and is backed by staunch U.S. government support.

That asymmetry also characterized the Houthis’ conflict with Saudi Arabia. Between 2015 and 2021, more than 1,000 missiles and drones launched by the Houthis at Saudi Arabia were largely thwarted, killing around 120 people in total, according to Saudi authorities. By comparison, airstrikes carried out by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, many of them by squadrons relying on U.S. support, killed more than 20,000 people, experts estimate."

“We’re actively helping the Israelis to do a number of things,” Christopher P. Maier, an assistant secretary of defense, told a special operations conference in Washington. He said that a main task was to help Israel “identify hostages, including American hostages. It’s really our responsibility to do so.”

Mr. Maier declined to say how many U.S. Special Operations forces were currently in Israel. But other U.S. officials say the Defense Department has dispatched several dozen commandos in recent weeks, in addition to a small team that was in Israel on Oct. 7 conducting previously scheduled training.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters, said the commandos would join F.B.I., State Department and other U.S. government hostage-recovery specialists in their discussions with Israeli counterparts.

The U.S. Special Operations forces are not assigned any combatant roles in Israel, but they are talking through with their Israeli counterparts “what is going to be a very complex fight going forward” in Gaza, Mr. Maier said.

In his discussions with his Israeli counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin II has stressed the need for careful consideration of how Israeli forces conduct a ground invasion of Gaza, where Hamas maintains an intricate network of tunnels under densely populated areas.

“We will work with them as much as possible to help advise them on those types of activities,” Mr. Maier said.

Several Western countries have secretly moved small teams of their own special forces closer to Israel to help with any potential rescue operation and to be nearby to assist in any large-scale evacuations of their citizens from Israel or Lebanon.

Mr. Maier said U.S. Special Operations forces in the region are also poised “to help our own citizens get out of places and to help our embassies be secure.”"

The death toll in Gaza rose sharply yesterday, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, after Israel said it had struck hundreds of targets in the territory in one of the biggest barrages of airstrikes in recent days.

The Gaza health ministry said yesterday that Israeli airstrikes had killed at least 436 people “in the past hours,” bringing the death toll to more than 5,000 since Oct. 7, when Israel began launching airstrikes in retaliation for an attack by the Hamas militant group that killed 1,400 people.

Hamas released two additional hostages yesterday, according to the group and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Their release, which Hamas said was for “humanitarian and health reasons,” came three days after the group set free an Israeli-American mother and daughter. More than 200 others are believed to still be held.

U.S. officials said that the Biden administration had advised Israel to delay a ground invasion of Gaza, to allow more time for negotiations to release the more than 200 people being held hostage by Hamas and other groups in Gaza, and for more humanitarian aid to reach the territory."
54,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/us/politics/biden-albanese-australia-israel.html,"President Biden expressed forceful support for Israel on Wednesday and cautioned that the country should do everything in its power to protect civilians but added that their deaths were ultimately “the price of waging a war.”

Offering few caveats, Mr. Biden said Israel had a right and “a responsibility to respond to the slaughter of their people” on Oct. 7, when Hamas invaded Israel in an attack that the Israeli government says killed more than 1,400 civilians and soldiers.

Mr. Biden also cast doubt on claims by Palestinians about the number of civilians who have been killed in Gaza during the past two weeks, a number the Hamas-run health ministry says is more than 6,500 people. In its internal and public reports, the State Department cites the United Nations, which cites the Gaza health ministry.

“I have no notion that Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed,” Mr. Biden said at a news conference in the Rose Garden with Anthony Albanese, the Australian prime minister. “I’m sure innocents have been killed. And that’s the price of waging a war.”

He added that the “Israelis should be incredibly careful to be sure that they’re focusing on going after the folks that are propagating this war against Israel.”

The president also said he was alarmed by “extremist settlers” attacking Palestinians in the West Bank, and he accused the settlers of “pouring gasoline on fire” and “attacking Palestinians in places they’re entitled to be.”

Mr. Biden’s warnings for Israel were less gentle than they were during an emotional visit to Tel Aviv last week. In those remarks, he urged leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, against repeating the same mistakes the United States made in a fog of rage and grief after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

But violence and reports of human suffering have only increased in the days since Mr. Biden’s visit to Israel. A barrage of Israeli airstrikes against Gaza have threatened to upend an already unsteady Middle East. Officials in the Biden administration have tried to advise Israeli officials against carrying out any major strike against Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese group, that could draw the United States further into the war."

nicholas kristof

I’m Nicholas Kristof. I’m a columnist for The New York Times. I’ve been covering the Middle East for about four decades. I’ve been here since October 20. And I, in particular, have been talking to family members of people who were murdered by Hamas in the terror attacks. A lot of my reporting throughout my career has been about really grim topics. And I’ve just never felt more pessimistic about the state of the conflict. But I also deeply believe in pointing to solutions and trying to give readers hope. And so I found some of the family members of victims of the Hamas attacks who were calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, who don’t want people in Gaza to suffer the way that they themselves have suffered. I sat down with one of them, Maoz Inon, in Tel Aviv.

maoz inon I’m not a politician. I’m not a spokesman. I’m not a diplomat. I’m hostilier.

nicholas kristof

I met him at a hostel that he runs. It’s a kind of amazing place. It’s a social enterprise that hires Israelis and Palestinians together. And it has these common spaces where everybody sits around and talks and chats. He’s a long distance backpacker, as I am. And so we talked about the trails we shared and about paths to peace.

maoz inon We just need to stop the killing. We must kill the Hamas with hope. We must kill its motivation with a promise for peace, for equality, for justice.

nicholas kristof

His mom and dad were both among those who were massacred by Hamas this month. Maoz and his siblings got a text from their parents, saying that they were in their safe room in their house and that there was gunfire in the area and that they’d locked the doors. And that was the last they heard of it. And then the house was destroyed, apparently, with something like an RPG. And so they think and hope that the death was instantaneous. But to lose your parents like that and to have other friends that you grew up with killed and kidnapped, it was devastating for all of them. Maoz, I think, understands more viscerally the evil of Hamas than anybody. And yet, the fact that he can still find empathy for civilians in Gaza, I just find so admirable.

maoz inon My family and I, we are not seeking revenge. So if we kill all the Hamas leaders, so what their children will want to do in 5, 10, 20 years? What their grandchildren will want to do? Someone need to be brave enough to stop the cycle of blood, the cycle of violence that has been going on for a century.

nicholas kristof

People like Maoz just give me hope. He reminded me that even in our darkest hours, humans have an amazing capacity for strength and resilience, compassion, empathy, and vision.

maoz inon We need hope. We need reconciliation. We need peace. nicholas kristof Where does that come from? Because your parents were murdered. You had friends who were butchered. maoz inon Killed, butchered, yeah. nicholas kristof The natural human response is to punch. maoz inon It’s from my mom’s legacy. And I’m taking it for my mom. I’m taking it for my father. We will always have the reasons to hate. But I’m saying, one day, we’ll have to start using the power of reconciliation, the power of forgiveness.

nicholas kristof

I’ve got to say that Maoz is not representative of victims’ families. The mood in Israel is a little parallel to what it was in the US after 9/11. People want action. They are just frustrated. They’re angry. They feel unsafe. And resonating with a history of pogroms and the Holocaust, they want to hit back hard at Hamas and at Gaza. There was a poll here that found that nearly half of Jewish Israelis say that the suffering of Palestinian civilians should not be taken into consideration at all in planning for fighting in the Gaza Strip. In some sense, that’s human nature. But if even people like Maoz who were traumatized, who were anguished at the barbarism of those attacks, who were in grief themselves, if they can find the clarity to understand that an invasion of Gaza, an ever higher body count may not help, then that offers a ray of hope for the rest of us.

maoz inon I have zero hate in myself. I have zero need for revenge. And I have a dream. I have a dream that Israel and Palestine are living in peace among each other in the Holy Land. This is my dream.

57,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/us/politics/israel-us-gaza-invasion.html,"The Biden administration is concerned that Israel lacks achievable military objectives in Gaza, and that the Israel Defense Forces are not yet ready to launch a ground invasion with a plan that can work, senior administration officials said.

In phone conversations with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III has stressed the need for careful consideration of how Israeli forces might conduct a ground invasion of Gaza, where Hamas maintains intricate tunnel networks under densely populated areas.

Biden administration officials insisted that the United States had not told Israel what to do and still supported the ground invasion. But the Pentagon has sent a three-star Marine, Lt. Gen. James Glynn, along with other officers to help the Israelis with the challenges of fighting an urban war.

A Pentagon official said on Monday that the deployment of General Glynn, reported earlier by Axios, did not mean the Pentagon was making decisions for Israel. General Glynn, the official said, would not be on the ground in Israel if an incursion into Gaza begins.

Israeli officials in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But on Sunday, a diplomat from the Israeli Embassy denied that the U.S. government was advising the Israelis to delay the ground invasion. “The U.S. is not pressing Israel in regards to the ground operation,” the diplomat said.

In his conversations with Mr. Gallant, Mr. Austin has described the hard-fought campaign to clear the Iraqi city of Mosul of Islamic State fighters in 2016 and 2017. At the time, Mr. Austin was the head of United States Central Command, and American troops were backing their Kurdish and Iraqi counterparts in the fight.

“The first thing that everyone should know, and I think everyone does know, is that urban combat is extremely difficult,” Mr. Austin told ABC News’s “This Week” on Sunday.

He said that he had “encouraged” Mr. Gallant to “conduct their operations in accordance with the law of war.” American officials have become increasingly concerned that a ground invasion in Gaza could lead to a huge loss of civilian lives.

He was on the phone again with Mr. Gallant on Monday, Pentagon officials said, emphasizing “the importance of civilian protection.” In an emailed statement, Brig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said that the two men also discussed American security assistance to Israel.

But the administration is also concerned, the officials said, that the Israel Defense Forces do not yet have a clear military pathway to achieve Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s goal of eradicating Hamas. In conversations with Israeli officials since the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, American officials said they have not yet seen an achievable plan of action.

President Biden has alluded to that publicly. During his speech in Tel Aviv last week, he warned that Israel would need “clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you’re on will achieve those objectives.”

American officials said that Israel must decide whether, for instance, to try to take out Hamas by using surgical airstrikes combined with targeted raids by special operations troops — as American warplanes and Iraqi and Kurdish troops did in Mosul — or to roll into Gaza with tanks and infantry, as American Marines and soldiers, along with Iraqi and British forces, did in Falluja in 2004.

Both tactics will result in heavy losses, U.S. officials said, but a ground operation could be far bloodier, for troops and civilians. At the Pentagon, many officials believe that the Mosul and Raqqa clearing operations in Iraq more than a decade after Falluja are a better model for urban warfare.

“One of the things we’ve learned is how to account for civilians in the battle space, and they are a part of the battle space, and we, in accordance of the law of war, we’ve got to do what’s necessary to protect those civilians,” Mr. Austin said on Sunday.

But both Mosul and Raqqa resulted in significant civilian casualties. While such figures can vary widely, The Associated Press put the number of civilians killed during the effort to rid Mosul of Islamic State fighters at between 9,000 and 11,000. And the Islamic State had only two years to prepare defenses in Mosul, argued Michael Knights, a fellow with The Washington Institute.

“Hamas has had 15 years to prepare a dense ‘defense in depth’ that integrates subterranean, ground-level and aboveground fortifications, communication tunnels, emplacements and fighting positions,” Mr. Knights wrote in an analysis earlier this month, “as well as potential minefields, improvised explosive devices, explosively formed penetrator anti-armor mines and buildings rigged as explosive booby traps.”

Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, called on Israel on Monday to delay a ground invasion of Gaza to buy time for hostage negotiations, allow more humanitarian aid to reach Palestinian civilians and give Israeli commanders more opportunity to fine-tune their urban-combat planning.

“From an operational standpoint, this is very complicated, and the more intelligence you gather and your troops can take into urban combat, the better,” Mr. Reed said by phone from Cairo, where he and other senators were wrapping up a trip to Saudi Arabia, Israel and Egypt. “A little extra time might be helpful. There are so many factors. Rushing into this probably is not the best approach.”

The Biden administration has given the same advice to Israel. Like U.S. officials, Mr. Reed said he also still supports the ground invasion to destroy Hamas. But he warned that a block-by-block urban fight in Gaza would be “a long-term effort,” noting that it took the Iraqi army, assisted by the United States, nine months to rout the Islamic State from Mosul.

As the Israel-Hamas war stretches on — with Israeli airstrikes hitting more targets in Gaza amid calls by the U.S. and others to delay a potential ground invasion — companies are finding themselves increasingly tangled in the conflict’s complex politics.

Businesses across the corporate world are seeking to find a balance in their responses to the war that don’t offend users, partners and their own employees. As universities dealing with irate donors have found, that isn’t easy.

Social media giants are dealing with a debate over online expression. LinkedIn issued a warning to a pro-Israel website that accused thousands of people of publishing pro-terrorism content that was apparently scraped off the social network. Critics of the site said it featured people who didn’t explicitly support Hamas or who sought to draw attention to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Meanwhile, Meta has struggled with applying its content policies fairly across its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, according to The Wall Street Journal. The company has already apologized for a glitch that translated some language in user profiles from Arabic as “Palestinian terrorists.”

Employers are also facing pressure to take a stand. Corporate leaders have had to weigh how far to go in any statements they make, as they search for a balance between denouncing the Hamas attacks and antisemitism, and decrying Islamophobia and calling for a cease-fire.

Experts say companies often find themselves out of their depth in talking about the knotty topic and that sometimes there’s little benefit to rushing out a statement. Still, leaders of groups have been criticized for not commenting publicly, especially since organizations had spoken out on issues including abortion rights and Black Lives Matter.

Some companies, especially those without operations in the Middle East, have chosen not to speak. The C.O.O. of the software company Asana, for example, said it was guided by a major principle: “What problem are we trying to solve?”

High-ranking officials have already faced blowback. The C.E.O. of Web Summit, one of Europe’s biggest tech conferences, resigned this past weekend as major sponsors and speakers pulled out of the event following criticism of his public remarks on Israel.

And a top agent at Creative Artists Agency resigned her leadership roles at the firm after apologizing for content critical of Israel that she had posted on her Instagram account.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING

Chevron agrees to buy a rival driller, Hess, for $53 billion. The all-stock deal is the second takeover announced this month by an energy giant doubling down on its core business, despite concerns about climate change. Buying Hess will fortify Chevron’s holdings in oil-rich Guyana, just as Exxon Mobil’s $59.5 billion bid for Pioneer Natural Resources consolidates ownership of the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico.

House Republicans plan a forum for speaker candidates. The event, scheduled for later ton Monday will give the nine lawmakers angling for the leadership position to state their case to colleagues ahead of a vote Tuesday on a new nominee. But the crowded field is likely to complicate that effort. The House remains unable to function without a presiding speaker.

Hollywood actors and studios will restart contract negotiations. The SAG-AFTRA union and the alliance representing media giants will meet on Tuesday, as figures on both sides press to restart American movie and television productions. The two were far apart earlier this month on issues including streaming payouts and the use of artificial intelligence.

A new report calls for a global minimum tax on billionaires. Researchers writing for the E.U. Tax Observatory found that a 2 percent levy on the world’s 2,756 wealthiest people could raise close to $250 billion a year for cash-strapped governments. It’s the latest demand for higher taxation of the wealthy amid criticism about their low overall tax bills, but given opposition among lawmakers, including in Congress, such a move is unlikely in the near term.

Big focus on Big Tech

Four of the world’s biggest publicly traded companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta — report earnings this week, with investors anxiously awaiting signs that Big Tech’s bet on artificial intelligence is beginning to pay off.

Microsoft and Google’s parent Alphabet will report on Tuesday. Meta is set to go on Wednesday, and Amazon on Thursday. Further out are Apple on Nov. 2 and Nvidia, the chip-maker, on Nov. 21.

Here’s what to watch: Consumer and business takeup of A.I. will be a big focus. Analysts will also be zeroing in on updates about the digital advertising and e-commerce markets, ahead of the crucial holiday sales period.

They will also want to know if the worst has passed after the tech giants laid off thousands of workers and slowed their corporate spending earlier this year amid an uncertain economic outlook.

A tech rally earlier this year has evaporated. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sank to a near five-month low on Friday, as investors fretted about growing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates. The Nasdaq has fallen roughly 3.3 percent since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, raising fears of a wider war in the region that could hurt an already fragile global economy."

60,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/us/politics/israel-aid-republicans-mike-johnson.html,"Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to force a stand-alone vote on aid for Israel, peeling off a request from the Biden administration for money from Ukraine and coupling it with spending cuts, has set up a confrontation between the House and Senate over how to fund U.S. allies during the conflicts.

Mr. Johnson, the Louisiana Republican who has personally voted against sending military aid to Kyiv, released a $14 billion aid bill for Israel on Monday. It includes a provision that would rescind the same amount of money earmarked for the Internal Revenue Service as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, a key piece of President Biden’s agenda.

Mr. Biden has asked Congress to pass a $105 billion aid package for Israel and Ukraine that also has funds for Taiwan and border security in the United States. But Mr. Johnson spurned that request, in an acknowledgment of how toxic funding for Ukraine has become among Republicans.

And while a bill to help fund Israel in its war against Hamas would likely have mustered an overwhelming bipartisan vote, Mr. Johnson went one step further, injecting a provision that would roll back a top priority of Mr. Biden and Democrats that experts said would increase the nation’s debt.

In an interview on Tuesday on Fox News’s “Outnumbered,” Mr. Johnson conceded that the provision could erode bipartisan support for the aid package, but he essentially dared Democrats to vote against supporting Israel.

“If you put this to the American people and weigh the two needs, I think they will say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent is a more immediate need than I.R.S. agents,” Mr. Johnson said.

The decision sets the House on a collision course with the White House and the Democratic-held Senate, where a bipartisan group of lawmakers has demanded that Congress pass legislation to address both conflicts at the same time.

“Rather than putting forward a package that strengthens American national security in a bipartisan way, the bill fails to meet the urgency of the moment by deepening our divides and severely eroding historic bipartisan support for Israel’s security,” White House officials said in a policy statement on Tuesday night threatening to veto the Republican-written bill. “It inserts partisanship into support for Israel, making our ally a pawn in our politics, at a moment we must stand together.”

Earlier, in an address from the Senate floor, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said, “I hope the new speaker realizes that this is a grave mistake and quickly changes course.”

Mr. Johnson appears to have structured the Israel legislation in an effort to keep his conference, which is deeply divided over funding foreign wars, united in the early days of his speakership. Looming over him is the knowledge that his predecessor, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, was ousted after he passed two bills — one to avert the nation’s first default on its debt and the other to avert a shutdown — that did not have majority backing from his House Republicans.

Already two Republicans, Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, have said they would oppose the $14 billion stand-alone bill for Israel.

“The United States government needs to focus on spending Americans’ hard earned tax dollars on our own country and needs to serve the American people NOT the rest of the world,” Ms. Greene wrote on social media.

Including a measure to rescind money from the I.R.S. — an idea popular among conservatives who reviled Mr. Biden’s landmark health, climate and tax law — would actually add to the debt, according to past analyses from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Steven Ellis, the president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, denounced it as a “cynical ploy that risks crippling the I.R.S.”

And Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said in a statement that while the House’s call to offset military spending for Israel with spending cuts was “welcome news,” paying for it “by defunding tax enforcement is worse than not paying for it at all.”

“Instead of costing $14 billion, the House bill will add upward of $30 billion to the debt. Instead of avoiding new borrowing, this plan doubles down on it,” Ms. MacGuineas said.

It also all but guarantees the legislation will be dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate, where even leading Republicans have said they favor the Biden administration’s strategy of linking Ukraine and Israel funding together.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader who has been his party’s most vocal advocate for funding the war in Ukraine, has doubled down on his aggressive support for sending U.S. assistance to help the country beat back a Russian invasion.

“The threats facing America and our allies are serious and they’re intertwined,” he said on Tuesday. “If we ignore that fact, we do so at our own peril.”

He added on Tuesday that while he and Mr. Schumer were “conceptually in the same place” on linking Ukraine and Israel aid, Democrats would need to swallow “strong border provisions” in order to win Republican votes.

On Monday, as House Republicans were finalizing their bill to dispatch security assistance to Israel alone, Mr. McConnell was in Kentucky, hosting Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, at a forum at the University of Louisville, where he excoriated the approach Mr. Johnson had embraced.

“Some say our support for Ukraine comes at the expense of more important priorities. But as I’ve said every time I get the chance, this is a false choice,” he said, calling for “swift and decisive action.”

Some other leading Senate Republicans have been even more explicit about rejecting Mr. Johnson’s approach.

“Some have argued for decoupling funding to address these threats,” Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the top Republican on the Appropriations Committee, said on Tuesday at the start of a hearing with top administration officials to discuss Mr. Biden’s national security spending request. “We must recognize that our national security interests are being aggressively challenged by all these authoritarian actors in an effort to dismantle the international order that we established following World War II.”

But some Senate Republicans have pushed back.

“I’m worried that if we talk about Ukraine and the border and Taiwan and Gaza, what’s realistically going to happen is we’re going to be up against the government funding deadline,” said Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, referring to a Nov. 17 cutoff for government funding. “And then it’s going to be a huge transaction. So we all agree on Israel. Let’s just move Israel.”

Mr. Hawley added: If Mr. McConnell “thinks he can make a case on Ukraine, fine, go for it. My guess is you can get Ukraine aid passed, probably as a stand-alone bill here. So he’s welcome to do that. I would just say, let’s not hold up Israel.”

During the hearing, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the panel’s chairwoman, attempted to enlist top administration officials in countering Republican arguments against packaging all of the security spending in one large bill.

“Increasingly Russia and Iran are working together to challenge our leadership, to hem us in globally,” said Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, who met with Mr. Johnson on Tuesday. “If we start to peel off pieces of this package, they will see that. They will understand that we are playing whack-a-mole, while they cooperate increasingly.”

As conflict intensified on Israel’s border with Lebanon, Israeli authorities said they were expanding a state-funded evacuation plan to an additional 14 villages. Along with a rare airstrike on the West Bank, the fighting raised fears that the war could expand.

Israel’s military said that attacks from Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia that controls southern Lebanon, had resulted in civilian and military casualties. Amid concerns that the conflict could spill over, the Pentagon said on Saturday that it was sending an antimissile battery and battalions of the Patriot ground-based air defense system to the Middle East.

Israeli forces massed along the border with Gaza yesterday ahead of an expected ground invasion of the enclave. Israel’s military efforts to eradicate Hamas “may take a month, two, or three, but in the end, Hamas will no longer exist,” the country’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said yesterday.

Violence also has been surging across the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Israel carried out an airstrike against what it described as an underground “terror compound” beneath a mosque in the city of Jenin. The claims had not been independently verified. Two people were killed, according to Palestinian health officials."
62,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/world/europe/dagestan-airport-mob-russia-israel-plane.html,"An uprising in southern Russia, where rioters stormed an airport tarmac apparently searching for Jewish passengers on a flight from Israel, has shocked Jews in Russia and beyond, drawn condemnation from the Israeli government and prompted the Kremlin to call an unscheduled meeting to address the clashes.

Hundreds of young men stormed the main airport in the predominantly Muslim republic of Dagestan on Sunday night, searching for a commercial flight from Tel Aviv. Videos and some images on social media showed some of the rioters holding Palestinian flags and carrying signs opposing the war in Gaza, possibly spurred on by a Telegram messaging channel that urged them to “catch” the passengers of the incoming flight from Israel.

The Israeli government, in a statement, said Monday that it expected the Russian authorities to protect all Israeli citizens and Jews and to act firmly against the rioters, describing the episode as “wild incitement directed at Jews and Israelis.”

At least 20 people were injured in the riot, and dozens were arrested. The government in the predominantly Muslim republic said Monday that the outburst had been calmed and vowed to prevent further clashes. Russian aviation authorities said that the airport, in Makhachkala, the republic’s capital, would reopen on Tuesday.

The uprising highlighted the challenges that the Kremlin faces in managing the various parts of its vast multiethnic and multireligious country. Ethnic tensions in the North Caucasus are a major risk factor for overall Russian stability, given the region’s recent history of war, and incidents of terrorism in Chechnya and Dagestan.

It also underscored how the Kremlin’s decision to distance itself from Israel and from the Israeli military campaign against Hamas in Gaza can cause instability at home. Russia has around 25 million Muslims, including at least two million in Moscow, and this population is growing at a fast rate.

In recent days President Vladimir V. Putin has taken steps suggesting increased concern that the Israeli-Hamas war could lead to ethnic strife in Russia.

He gathered faith leaders last week at the Kremlin to discuss it, saying “interethnic and interfaith accord is the foundation of the Russian state.” And representatives of Hamas were in Moscow last week, prompting Israel to summon the Russian ambassador in Tel Aviv to complain.

The Russians on Monday blamed outsiders for instigating the turmoil. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, accused “outside interference” for causing the riots but cited no evidence.

Speaking on Monday at an meeting on the crisis in Dagestan, Mr. Putin blamed Western special services for the uprising. “The events in Makhachkala yesterday night were instigated including via social networks not least from the Ukrainian territory,” he said, repeating his assertions that the United States was responsible for the crisis in Israel.

The Russian leader has listed interethnic and interreligious accord in Russia as a policy priority. Anti-Israel and antisemitic protests in the North Caucasus region that includes Dagestan where Mr. Putin fought his first war as Russian leader, could jeopardize that at a time when the Kremlin is also waging a long and bloody war in Ukraine.

Any instability in Russia is good for Ukraine, which since 2014 has recruited disgruntled Muslims including Chechens. Trying to destabilize the Muslim minorities is a long-running approach to fighting Russia, used by the Germans in World War II and, in the Russian view, by the West in the 1980s during Russia’s war in Afghanistan.

The Dagestan government blamed pro-Ukrainian conspirators for the clashes at the airport, saying that they had inflamed the public to fuel unrest in Russia.

Videos and images shared on social media showed a chaotic scene at the airport in Makhachkala. In one video verified by The New York Times, a group of dozens of men, some carrying Palestinian flags, swarms a parked airplane from the carrier Red Wings, apparently after the passengers had disembarked. “There are no passengers here anymore,” a man in a yellow safety vest tells the rioters, pointing at the plane. He adds, “I am Muslim.”

In another video verified by The Times, filmed from inside an airplane on the tarmac, a crew member can be heard announcing: “Please stay seated, and don’t try to open the plane’s door. There is an angry mob outside.”

Some of the protests were supported by a Telegram channel that discussed plans to “catch” the passengers of the flight, along with screenshots of the flight schedule. Pavel Durov, the Russian entrepreneur who owns Telegram, said he would block the channel.

The Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia, the leading organization in the country that unites Jews, said in a statement on Monday that local governments in the Caucasus “were not ready for such incidents and allowed for a mass violation of the law.”

“But it is hard to call this incompetence — the heads of republics likely could not imagine that multinational Caucasus will be gripped by such unrest,” said the head of the organization, Rabbi Aleksandr Boroda.

The regional police said in a statement that they had identified 150 people as having actively taken part in the riot and that 83 had been arrested. Nine police officers were injured in the clashes, two of whom were hospitalized, according to the statement.

Dagestan’s health ministry said that 20 people in total had been injured, including police officers and civilians. Four of them were still receiving treatment in a hospital on Monday, including three police officers and one civilian, the ministry said.

The police said that local investigators had opened a criminal investigation and vowed that everyone who had participated would be held responsible.

Sergei Melikov, the head of Dagestan, condemned the rioters, saying, “There was no honor in swearing at strangers, reaching into their pockets and trying to check their passport,” referring to reports that some of those who had stormed the airport had asked bystanders there to prove their nationality.

There were also reports of anti-Israel protests across the North Caucasus, a combustible region in the Russian south. On Saturday, dozens of people gathered in front of a hotel in the town of Khasavyurt, in Dagestan, after reports on social media claimed that it was “full of Jews.” About 200 people also gathered in the central square of Cherkessk, capital of the Karachay-Cherkessia republic, to protest the potential arrival of Israeli refugees, local news media reported.

Russia has gone to extraordinary lengths to crack down on protests over its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which it falsely claimed was being fought to rid the country of “Nazis.”

Aleksandr Verkhovsky, an analyst of interethnic relations and xenophobia at the Sova Center in Moscow, said the war in Ukraine had “radicalized the Russian society.” That radicalization can explain how genuine protest in support of civilians in Gaza could turn into an antisemitic mob, he said.

“People become more aggressive, being infected by the aggressive propaganda,” Mr. Verkhovsky said.

Ukrainian officials were quick to seize on the events in Russia as reflecting a deeper culture of hatred that the Kremlin had fomented for years.

“For Russian propaganda talking heads on official television, hate rhetoric is routine,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in a statement, noting the “appalling videos” coming out of Dagestan. “Hatred is what drives aggression and terror. We must all work together to oppose hatred.”

64,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/us/politics/biden-democrats-israel-2024.html,"The Democratic Party’s yearslong unity behind President Biden is beginning to erode over his steadfast support of Israel in its escalating war with the Palestinians, with a left-leaning coalition of young voters and people of color showing more discontent toward him than at any point since he was elected.

From Capitol Hill to Hollywood, in labor unions and liberal activist groups, and on college campuses and in high school cafeterias, a raw emotional divide over the conflict is convulsing liberal America.

While moderate Democrats and critics on the right have applauded Mr. Biden’s backing of Israel, he faces new resistance from an energized faction of his party that views the Palestinian cause as an extension of the racial and social justice movements that dominated American politics in the summer of 2020.

In protests, open letters, staff revolts and walkouts, liberal Democrats are demanding that Mr. Biden break with decades-long American policy and call for a cease-fire, even as Israel steps up its military operations in Gaza.

The political power of the Israel skeptics within the party is untested, with more than a year remaining until the 2024 presidential election. Their efforts have been fractious and disorganized, and they have little agreement on how much blame to lay at Mr. Biden’s feet or whether to punish him next November if he ignores their pleas.

And yet Mr. Biden is already struggling with low Democratic enthusiasm, and it would not take much of a slip in support from voters who backed him in 2020 to throw his re-election bid into question. His margin of victory in key battleground states was just a few thousand votes — hardly enough to spare a significant drop-off from young voters alienated by his loyalty to a right-wing Israeli government they see as hostile to their values.

At its heart, the turbulence over Israel is a fundamental disagreement over policy, setting it apart from challenges like voters’ dissatisfaction with the economy, which Mr. Biden’s allies believe can be solved with better messaging. The president, who has for decades positioned himself in the middle of his party and has navigated Democrats’ ideological and generational divide for the first half of his term, now confronts an issue that has no easy middle ground.

Perhaps most concerning for Mr. Biden is that in the halls of Congress, the most critical Democratic voices are Black and Hispanic Democrats who helped fuel his 2020 victory. As of Thursday, all 18 House members who had signed onto a resolution calling for an “immediate de-escalation and cease-fire in Israel and occupied Palestine” were people of color.

“We process pain, deprivation and cruelty personally, having either encountered it in our current lives or having had historical connections to it with our ancestors,” said Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, one of the cease-fire resolution’s co-sponsors. “So we understand that cruelty and war and violence do not have positive outcomes.”"
65,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/business/web-summit-paddy-cosgrave-israel.html,"The chief executive of Web Summit, one of Europe’s biggest technology conferences, stepped down on Saturday after major sponsors and speakers withdrew from the event, set for next month, following backlash over his public criticism of Israel’s response to the Hamas attacks.

Paddy Cosgrave, the Irish entrepreneur who founded Web Summit in 2009, announced his resignation after companies including Google, Intel, Meta, Siemens and the payments giant Stripe — many of whom were set to have executives speak at the event — said they were no longer coming.

“Unfortunately, my personal comments have become a distraction from the event, and our team, our sponsors, our start-ups and the people who attend,” he said in a statement. “I sincerely apologize again for any hurt I have caused.”

A spokeswoman for Web Summit said that the organization aimed to appoint a new chief executive as soon as possible. The event, which is scheduled to start on Nov. 13, is still set to go forward.

Mr. Cosgrave’s move was meant to insulate Web Summit, which runs events across the globe. Its flagship conference, which is now held in Lisbon, drew about 70,000 attendees last year and speakers that included both senior tech executives and celebrities.

Since the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, business leaders have taken aim at institutions that they said have been associated with unfair criticisms of Israel, or worse. In the United States, wealthy donors have threatened to withhold donations to schools like the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard.

Web Summit’s troubles began just over a week after Mr. Cosgrave criticized Western leaders and governments for supporting Israel as it responded to the Hamas raid. “War crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies, and should be called out for what they are,” he wrote on X on Oct. 13.

His comments drew rebukes from prominent technology executives, particularly those from Israel. “I’ll never be part of your future initiatives and we’ll never work together again,” Adam Singolda, the Israeli-born founder of the advertising company Taboola, replied.

Within days of the post, venture capitalists, including Ravi Gupta of Sequoia Capital and Garry Tan of the technology incubator Y Combinator, said they were dropping out.

Some tech executives worked behind the scenes to pressure participants to withdraw. And a group of Israeli technology and venture capital firms wrote in a public letter that they were boycotting the event, according to the trade publication Calcalist.

Initially, Mr. Cosgrave alternately struck both apologetic and defensive tones, condemning the Hamas attacks but also repeating his criticism of Israel’s military campaign. But by Tuesday, he published an apology on Web Summit’s site in which he said he defended “Israel’s right to exist and to defend itself.”

That did not appear to allay Mr. Cosgrave’s critics.

Starting midweek, tech giants announced that they would not be participating in the conference. And figures outside of technology who were initially listed as speakers at the event, including the actors Gillian Anderson and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, were no longer mentioned on Web Summit’s site as of Saturday.

Whether Mr. Cosgrave’s departure is enough to bring back those who have withdrawn is unclear. Representatives for Intel and Deel, a global payroll company that pulled its sponsorship of Web Summit midweek, said there currently weren’t plans to return.

Some critics also questioned on Saturday whether Mr. Cosgrave still retains his majority stake in Web Summit. His stake stood at 81 percent as of last summer, according to company filings in Ireland. A representative for Web Summit did not respond to requests for comment on his ownership.

It is unclear how many people will attend this year, though Web Summit said on Friday that the event expected about 70,000 people, the same as last year."

67,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-tanks-aid.html,"The Israeli military said on Thursday that it had briefly sent tanks into the northern Gaza Strip overnight as part of preparations for the next stage of fighting, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated a ground invasion by the troops massed on the enclave’s border was likely.

The military said in a Telegram post that it had hit multiple targets and “operated to prepare the battlefield,” but did not elaborate, while Mr. Netanyahu, in a televised speech on Wednesday evening, vowed that Israel would punish the armed group Hamas for the Oct. 7 assault that massacred more than 1,400 people and seized more than 200 hostages.

Since the Hamas attack, Israel has waged an aerial and artillery bombardment that has been far more intensive, more destructive and deadlier than any previously seen in Gaza. The Hamas-controlled government in Gaza said Thursday that the Israeli campaign has killed more than 7,000 people, with nearly 2,000 others trapped in the ruins of destroyed buildings, figures that could not be verified.

Hamas’s health ministry on Thursday released a list of 6,747 names of people it said had been confirmed killed, including 2,665 children, along with each person’s ID number, age and sex. It said 281 others who had died in the bombardment could not be identified.

That was an apparent response to President Biden, who said on Wednesday that he had “no confidence” in the death toll cited by the Gazan authorities. Last week, Hamas officials put the death toll in an explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City at 471, while U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that it was 100 to 300.

With Israel flattening many buildings and telling the population of northern Gaza to flee to the south, international aid agencies say more than half of the territory’s over 2 million people have been displaced.

The Israeli military said on Thursday that it had carried out more than 250 strikes in the preceding 24 hours; the Gazan health ministry said that at least 43 of those, and 481 resulting deaths, were in southern Gaza — where Israel has told civilians to go for their safety. Israel says it is hitting Hamas targets, often concealed within — or in tunnels beneath — residential buildings, mosques, schools and other civilian sites. Palestinians accuse it of indiscriminately killing civilians."
68,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/us/politics/biden-israel-netanyahu-gaza.html,"“There’s clearly something there that accounts for something rooted in him quite deeply,” said Mr. Ross, who has worked for or studied presidents of both parties since the 1980s. Of all of them, he said Mr. Biden’s ties to Israel appeared strongest. Recalling that day in 2002 when Mr. Biden made a point of showing up during the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, Mr. Ross said, “It was so poignant. I think it just speaks volumes about this emotional connection that he has.”

Mr. Blinken remembers that trip vividly, too. As a young aide who had just started working for the senator, it was a lesson in how Mr. Biden saw his relationship to Israel. Now as the secretary of state, Mr. Blinken is once again at Mr. Biden’s side as they make a point of showing up for Israel — both physically during a trip to Tel Aviv within range of Hamas rockets and politically in the form of staunch support for the country after the deadliest attack of its existence.

“This is something, as I’ve seen it and experienced it, that goes in a sense from his gut to his heart to his head,” Mr. Blinken said of the president in a phone interview. Other presidents may process the situation through an “intellectual policy prism,” he added. “But there’s something, as I’ve been able to witness it, that seems more visceral for him.”

Shalom Lipner, who was an adviser to seven consecutive Israeli prime ministers, said Mr. Biden was akin to the first Jewish president and now more popular in Israel than the country’s own leaders. “This isn’t just from today; we’re looking at a history here,” Mr. Lipner said. “He’s always been there.”

That does not mean that Mr. Biden has not experienced periods of friction with Israeli leaders, most notably the current prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and even now the president is trying in his own way to restrain the Israeli government from acting too quickly and too harshly.

But Mr. Biden’s “rock solid and unwavering support” for Israel, as he has described it, is born of a different era of politics. He is a creature of a time when Democrats were more uniformly pro-Israel. But while he has not changed, his party has, with progressives far more critical of what they see as Israeli repression of Palestinians, including occupation and settlement expansion in the West Bank and a longstanding blockade of Gaza that has turned it into what is often called an open-air prison.

Congressional Democrats on the far left like Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan have openly criticized Mr. Biden for not stopping Israel’s retaliation while “watching people commit genocide.” Even some younger members of Mr. Biden’s own staff privately do not understand why he has been so willing to back Mr. Netanyahu even as Israeli forces besiege Gaza, cut off food and fuel and pound the Hamas-run coastal enclave with bombs that Hamas officials in Gaza say have killed thousands of people.

Aides said Mr. Biden’s public embrace of Mr. Netanyahu gives him the ability to influence him in private. The president has spoken with the prime minister 10 times since Hamas assailants killed more than 1,400 people and seized another 200 as hostages on Oct. 7, in addition to flying across the world to hug Mr. Netanyahu and survivors of the attack.

In those private sessions, advisers said, Mr. Biden asks pointed questions rather than lecturing. Why do you plan to do it this way? Have you thought about what comes next? What have you done to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza?

“He genuinely feels that it’s not his place to tell another leader how to handle his own politics,” said Jonah Blank, who advised Mr. Biden on the Middle East during his Senate days. “He’ll offer advice, but he’s not going to do it like Tony Soprano.”

Mr. Blinken said Mr. Biden was able to be blunt with Mr. Netanyahu behind the scenes. “Because the president has so much credibility built up over so many years with Israelis, with the Jewish community here, he’s able to have very direct and sometimes, as warranted, very hard conversations that maybe others would have more difficulty having,” he said.

In examining Mr. Biden’s history with Israel, there is no Eddie Jacobson to his Harry Truman, no Jewish best friend who sensitized him to the issues of the Jewish state. But Mr. Biden traces his interest to childhood conversations with his father, who described the horrors of the Holocaust over dinner.

“The world was wrong — failing to respond to Hitler’s atrocities against the Jews — and we should be ashamed,” he quoted his father saying in one of his memoirs.

The issue came up in his first Senate campaign in Delaware in 1972 when a former campaign volunteer wrote a story in a local newspaper asserting that Mr. Biden’s support of Israel “was opportunistic and politically motivated,” as his sister, Valerie Biden Owens, recalled in her autobiography."

“As the debate focuses on death tolls, the bodies continue to pile up,” Mr. Shakir said. “Our focus should be on how to prevent further mass atrocities, instead of debating whether or not the number is exactly accurate or not. We know that Palestinians are being killed in unprecedentedly high numbers, and that needs to end.”

How much Hamas, which brooks little dissent within Gaza, influences ministry statistics — or whether it does at all — is unclear. The ministry predates Hamas’s control of Gaza, said Ibrahim Dalalsha, director of the Horizon Center, a Palestinian political research group.

Mr. Shakir said that while he considered the ministry’s tally of the total number of people killed in Gaza reliable, Gaza health officials had sometimes counted those killed by errant rockets fired by Hamas and its allies alongside those killed in airstrikes, as well as counting combatants alongside civilians, making it difficult to say with certainty how many civilians had been killed because of the Israeli bombardment.

But photographs, videos and satellite imagery point to widespread destruction in Gaza that Mr. Shakir said could plausibly result in the high casualties reported by Gaza’s Health Ministry. Doctors, aid workers and Gaza residents also report witnessing an ever-growing number of deaths.

Israel said on Wednesday that it had struck more than 7,000 targets since Oct. 7, including houses, mosques, malls and other civilian buildings, in Gaza, a densely populated area."

President Biden will visit Israel tomorrow after accepting an invitation from Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden will be following his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who was in Israel yesterday for the second time in the past week, after already having visited Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.

In today’s newsletter, we’ll explain what the U.S. is hoping to accomplish with this flurry of diplomacy over the past few days.

1. Support Israel

The U.S. is not trying to prevent an Israeli invasion of Gaza. Any country attacked as Israel was on Oct. 7 — with Hamas’s killing of more than 1,400 people and kidnapping of at least 199 — would be likely to respond militarily. Israel is no longer willing to accept Hamas’s control over Gaza, given that Hamas is a terrorist group, according to the U.S. and E.U., and has refused to recognize Israel’s right to exist.

“Israel is going after a group of people who have engaged in barbarism that is as consequential as the Holocaust,” Biden said in a “60 Minutes” interview. “Israel has to respond.”"
71,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/briefing/hamas-israel-war-us-economy-denmark-immigration.html,"Israel says its tanks briefly entered Gaza, as aid trickles in

The Israeli military said yesterday that it had briefly sent tanks into the northern Gaza Strip overnight as part of preparations for the next stage of fighting, after the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, indicated that the country was likely to carry out a ground invasion of the enclave.

Although details of the brief incursion remained scarce, a video released by Israel’s military showed Israeli tanks firing inside Gaza. The area is immediately next to Gaza’s northern border near the Mediterranean Sea, according to an examination of the footage by The New York Times.

“We brace for a ground incursion,” Netanyahu said. “I won’t detail when, how or how much. I also won’t specify the set of considerations we weigh. When we enter Gaza, we’ll make Hamas pay the price for its attack.”

Here’s the latest.

Delayed aid: As of yesterday morning, 74 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies had entered Gaza since Saturday, far short of the figure, at least 100 a day, that the U.N. said the enclave needs. U.N. officials and diplomats attribute the delay partly to Israel’s demands to inspect the trucks at a checkpoint about 25 miles from the entry point to Gaza from Egypt."
72,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/world/middleeast/israel-invasion-gaza-delay.html,"For 17 days, Israeli ground troops and tanks have been on standby, idling in the dusty fields around Gaza. Their stated mission: to invade the Palestinian coastal enclave and destroy the military capabilities of Hamas, the armed Islamist group, and its ability to rule there.

More than two weeks after hundreds of Hamas gunmen surged across the border into Israel, killing more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, and taking more than 220 hostages back to Gaza, many Israelis have been asking what the government is waiting for.

Various explanations have been put forward.

The United States has been pressuring Israel to hold off to allow more time for hostage negotiations and aid deliveries, and for more U.S. military assets to be deployed to the region. The Israeli news media is filled with reports of differences within the government and between the political leadership and the military. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, long viewed as cautious about military adventures, is thought to be still deciding when — or if — to go ahead.

So pervasive is the pall of infighting, paralysis and chaos that Mr. Netanyahu, his defense minister, Yoav Gallant — whom Mr. Netanyahu tried to fire in March — and the military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, issued an unusual wartime statement on Monday evening assuring a traumatized public that the three were “working in close and full cooperation, around the clock, to lead the state of Israel to a decisive victory,” and professing “total and mutual trust” among them."
73,https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000009159162/christopher-wray-terrorist-organizations.html,"The reality is that the terrorism threat has been elevated throughout 2023, but the ongoing war in the Middle East has raised the threat of an attack against Americans in the United States to a whole other level. We assess that the actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration, the likes of which we haven’t seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate several years ago. Here in the United States, our most immediate concern is that violent extremists, individuals or small groups, will draw inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks against Americans going about their daily lives. That includes not just homegrown violent extremists inspired by a foreign terrorist organization, but also domestic violent extremists targeting Jewish or Muslim communities."
74,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-attack-video.html,"Bloodied corpses lying in a bedroom, a bathroom, on the roads by their cars. An emergency medical worker pouring mineral water from a bottle to douse the smoldering remains of charred bodies. A dead baby whose body bore signs of violence.

Two soldiers without heads. Brutalized young women, one of them naked. Captives in Gaza surrounded by jeering gunmen.

Those images were part of nearly 44 minutes of raw footage that the Israeli military said was culled from hundreds of hours of material Israel had collected about the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas assailants from Hamas body cameras, dashcams, traffic cameras, closed-circuit TV and the mobile phones and social media accounts of victims, soldiers and emergency medical workers.

The military showed the compilation to foreign reporters on a day when Israel continued to bombard Gaza with heavy airstrikes overnight and as the death toll in Gaza surpassed 5,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, since Israel began retaliating for the attacks.

Reporters were told by the Israeli military not to record the footage. Certain sections, including video of a raid on a military base, have been previously verified by The New York Times. Some of the footage has already been shared on social media.

“We want to understand ourselves why we are in a war and what we are fighting for,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesman, said of the footage, which was shown in an auditorium at an army base north of Tel Aviv.

“What happened to Israel was not just a war crime,” he said, but “a crime against humanity.”

The footage opens with Hamas gunmen shooting at civilian cars and at people running across open fields as they flee the site of an open-air music festival. They whoop in triumph over their victims.

Footage from closed-circuit cameras captured one man scooping up two young boys, both wearing only underpants, as early morning sirens wailed, warning of incoming rocket fire. They ran out to a nearby bomb shelter. Assailants, lying in ambush, threw a grenade into the shelter, killing the man. The boys ran back to their house, where, distraught, one of them said he could not see anything. As a gunman rummaged in the refrigerator, the other boy cried, “Why am I alive?”

In another village, an assailant is heard calling his parents in Gaza from the phone of an Israeli woman. “I killed 10 Jews with my bare hands!” he shouted, according to an audio recording, adding, “Mom, your son is a hero!”

In other clips, victims are seen gagged and with their hands bound behind their backs. Faces are frozen in shock and agony. Women’s bones are broken, their legs twisted in impossible angles.

Many traumatized Israelis are only beginning to internalize the enormity of the disaster of Oct. 7. There has been little time for national mourning even as the country fears for and dreads the fighting to come.

Admiral Hagari said it was necessary to begin gathering the evidence to create a collective memory for future generations of what happened that day, which was the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust.

“We will not let the world forget,” he said. “It will define who we are.”"
75,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/world/middleeast/jabaliya-camp-strike-israel-gaza.html,"The Israeli military said that the strike had killed “a large number of terrorists,” including a senior Hamas commander it identified as Ibrahim Biari, saying that he had helped plan the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks on Israel. A Hamas spokesman denied that a commander had been in the targeted area.

The Times’s assessment of the damage shows multiple large buildings flattened. As of 2023, there were more than 116,000 people registered at the refugee camp, which covers an area of only 1.4 square kilometers.

The Jabaliya camp is in northern Gaza, an area for which the Israeli military has issued evacuation orders. “Giving warning does not absolve parties from the requirement to protect civilians,” said Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director for Human Rights Watch. “Civilians who do not evacuate” he added, must still be protected.

Marc Garlasco, a military adviser for PAX Protection of Civilians, a Dutch program affiliated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Netherlands, told The Times that the craters at the scene were consistent with the damage caused by Joint Direct Attack Munitions, or JDAMs, used by the Israeli military. These munition kits turn unguided bombs into precision, GPS-guided weapons.

Experts say that Israel’s bombardment of densely populated areas raises concerns under international humanitarian law. “International law prohibits attacks in which the expected harm to civilians and civilian properties is disproportionate to the anticipated military gain,” Mr. Shakir said.

76,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/us/politics/biden-israel-hezbollah-war.html,"President Biden and his top aides have been urging Israeli leaders against carrying out any major strike against Hezbollah, the powerful militia in Lebanon, that could draw it into the Israel-Hamas war, American and Israeli officials say.

The U.S. officials are concerned that some of the more hawkish members of Israel’s war cabinet have wanted to take on Hezbollah even as Israel begins a long conflict against Hamas after the Oct. 7 attacks. The Americans are conveying to the Israelis the difficulties of battling both Hamas in the south and a much more powerful Hezbollah force in the north.

U.S. officials believe Israel would struggle in a two-front war and that such a conflict could draw in both the United States and Iran, the militia’s main supporter.

The effort by top American officials to head off an Israeli offensive on Hezbollah, reported in detail here for the first time, reveals anxieties by the Biden administration over the war planning of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his aides, even as the two governments strive to present a strong united front in public.

American officials want to rein in Hezbollah too. In numerous meetings across the Middle East, American diplomats have been urging their Arab counterparts to help pass messages to the militia, including via their contacts in Iran, to try to prevent any Israel-Hezbollah war from erupting, whether through actions by the militia group or by the Israelis.

U.S. officials feared that Mr. Netanyahu might approve a pre-emptive strike on Hezbollah in the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, which killed more than 1,400 people. Although those fears have receded for now because Mr. Netanyahu cooled to the idea, anxieties still persist over two possibilities: an Israeli overreaction to Hezbollah rocket attacks, and harsh Israeli tactics in an expected ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza that would compel Hezbollah to enter the war."
77,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/opinion/biden-speech-israel-gaza.html,"While the president expressed deep understanding of Israel’s moral and strategic dilemma, he pleaded with Israeli military and political leaders to learn from America’s rush to war after Sept. 11, which took our troops deep into the dead ends and dark alleys of unfamiliar cities and towns in Iraq and Afghanistan.

However, from everything I have gleaned from senior U.S. officials, Biden failed to get Israel to hold back and think through all the implications of an invasion of Gaza for Israel and the United States. So let me put this in as stark and clear language as I can, because the hour is late:

I believe that if Israel rushes headlong into Gaza now to destroy Hamas — and does so without expressing a clear commitment to seek a two-state solution with the Palestinian Authority and end Jewish settlements deep in the West Bank — it will be making a grave mistake that will be devastating for Israeli interests and American interests.

It could trigger a global conflagration and explode the entire pro-American alliance structure that the United States has built in the region since Henry Kissinger engineered the end of the Yom Kippur War in 1973.

I am talking about the Camp David peace treaty, the Oslo peace accords, the Abraham Accords and the possible normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. The whole thing could go up in flames."
78,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/business/media/israel-journalists-hamas-war.html,"Last weekend, at least a dozen people surrounded the home of a left-wing Israeli commentator who had expressed concern about civilian deaths in Gaza, shouting “traitor” and firing flares in his direction.

This week, a prominent right-wing activist posted a video of himself shouting at and threatening members of a TV crew that was filming Israeli soldiers. Other journalists say they are getting threats and being harassed on social media.

In Israel, many journalists are covering the war while processing their own grief and shock over the surprise attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7. Some lost relatives in the attacks.

But some Israeli journalists and supporters of the press say that covering the war has become even more difficult because of the vitriol they have received from fellow Israelis who have been upset by their questioning of the country’s actions in response to the Hamas attacks.

Expressing dissenting opinions has become even more fraught than in previous conflicts, said Anat Saragusti, a senior staff member for the Union of Journalists, an Israeli organization with 1,500 members.

“It has a chilling effect,” Ms. Saragusti said.

Journalists and media experts attributed the change to several factors: The attacks by Hamas have been especially traumatizing for Israelis. The media environment has grown more polarized in recent years. And the spread of misinformation, particularly on WhatsApp and social media platforms like Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter, has intensified existing viewpoints.

“There are fewer people voicing opposition to the Israeli operation,” said Natan Sachs, the director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “There is much more vitriol toward those who do.”

Mr. Sachs noted that the polarized media environment was not unique to Israel, although it has increased in the country in recent years, in part because Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made the press a focus of his energy. Two of three criminal cases that Mr. Netanyahu has been involved in feature accusations of wrongdoing in pursuing positive media coverage, which he has denied.

“The last time we had a major operation in Gaza, the traditional media was still not that polarized,” said Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan research group, referring to 2014. She said that people had hardened their views because they were often consuming news that aligned with their views, particularly online.

“That’s the fourth dimension of the war,” she said. “It’s not just on the ground or by sea or by air force. It has to do with the cyber-dimension that creates different influences on our ability to understand reality.”

Dr. Shwartz Altshuler is among those researching ways to make journalists in Israel feel safer while they are reporting information that is critical of the government’s policies and Israel’s military. She helped start an organization that tracks attacks on journalists and protesters in Israel. More than 1,000 attacks have been reported since March of this year, she said.

Questions have swirled over a potential Israeli intelligence failure since the Oct. 7 attacks. American and Israeli officials have said that none of Israel’s intelligence services had specific warning that Hamas was preparing the sophisticated assault.

Tal Shalev, a political commentator and reporter for the Hebrew news site Walla, said she felt a duty to continue writing columns critical of the government and asking tough questions of officials, particularly about the missteps and misdoings of decision makers, even though she sometimes receives pushback on social media for doing so.

“There’s a sentiment here saying it’s not the time now to deal with malpractices and problems, and we should wait until after the war because now is the time to unite and not criticize the government,” Ms. Shalev said. “I don’t fully agree with that.”

“Of course, this is the time to unite,” she added. “I’m an Israeli citizen, and I’m hurting with my people and I want to win this war. I just don’t think that because of the war we should stop being alert and stop doing our jobs as journalists.”"
79,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/arts/dave-chappelle-israel-walkouts.html,"Dave Chappelle waded briefly into the Israel-Hamas conflict at a show in Boston last week, drawing cheers from some audience members and causing others to walk out as he decried the humanitarian crisis unfolding at the Gaza Strip, according to news reports and a spokeswoman for the comedian.

The set was on Thursday, the first of a pair of shows Mr. Chappelle held at Boston’s TD Garden, and no jokes or commentary about the war had been planned, said the spokeswoman, Carla Sims.

Mr. Chappelle’s remarks were first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which said that some audience members had cheered Mr. Chappelle as he spoke about the conflict while others walked out. The Los Angeles Times reported that perhaps 200 people in the roughly 17,000-person audience had departed toward the end of the show.

“As a comedian and satirist, he has to navigate the complexities of competing truths, presenting perspectives that can be both thought-provoking and challenging,” Ms. Sims said of Mr. Chappelle.

People were not allowed to access their phones during the performance, and there was scant evidence of exactly what transpired during the set. But Mr. Chappelle was at one point drawn into the topic of the war by audience members and then focused on it for roughly eight minutes, according to news reports and a person who listened to a recording of the set.

After initially declining to engage, Mr. Chappelle, who has not hesitated to address controversial issues in recent years, raised concerns about the way a group of Harvard students had been treated after writing an anti-Israel letter. At that point an audience member yelled that he should shut up, according to reports and the person who heard the recording.

Mr. Chappelle, apparently taken aback at an effort to silence him at his own show, told the person that he should shut up, according to news reports and the person who listened to the tape. He said the attacks of Oct. 7 were horrific and also criticized Israel for its role in displacing more than one million people, and withholding food, water and fuel. The comedian added that people on both sides of the conflict needed to self-reflect and consider how they were treating each other.

He eventually acknowledged that the person who had told him to shut up had been right to be angry, according to the person who heard the tape. But he encouraged people to talk to one another and emphasized that everyone should remember that human beings had been killed in the conflict."

That she was taken through the plowed fields with the men in front on one side and the men behind her. And that while she was being taken, she was hit by sticks. They walked for a few kilometers on the wet ground. There are a huge, huge network of tunnels underneath. It looks like a spider web."
81,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hostages.html,"Despite a weekslong bombing effort by the Israeli military, which has left thousands dead, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, Ms. Lifshitz described a seemingly well-organized operation, with operatives given special responsibilities, including doctors, guards and medics.

The militants brought her to a large underground hall where they had gathered 25 people, before five from Nir Oz were separated and placed in a room on their own, Ms. Lifshitz said. “We were closely guarded by their guards and a medic. At a certain point a doctor also arrived and made sure that we received our pills and medication,” she said.

Ms. Lifshitz said her captors paid special attention to the health of the hostages, providing medication, shampoo and feminine hygiene products. The hostages were fed the same meager provisions their guards ate: a single daily meal of pita bread, two kinds of cheese and cucumber.

“They were very attentive to the sanitary aspect,” she said, “so we don’t get sick on them, God forbid. There was a doctor nearby who would come every two or three days to check in on us. And the medic took the responsibility to bring us medication. If they did not have the exact same medication, they brought us the equivalent.”

In a video documenting Ms. Lifshitz’s handover to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which was filmed and released by the armed wing of Hamas, Ms. Lifshitz appears to grasp one Hamas member’s hands and repeat the Hebrew word “shalom,” meaning goodbye and also peace.

Her grandson, Daniel Lifshitz, said in a televised interview that his grandmother would remain in the hospital for now, adding that she would “need a lot of time to recover from this, even though she looks strong.”

Israel has historically made the return of captives a national priority. In 2011, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners — including Hamas’s current leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar — in exchange for a single Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit.

But the country has never faced a crisis in which so many citizens were being held hostage at one time. Hamas has said it is willing to consider releasing “foreign nationalities under temporary custody, as and when security circumstances permit.”

Before Tuesday’s release of Ms. Lifshitz and Ms. Cooper, the group had allowed the release of only two other captives, the dual American-Israeli citizens Judith Raanan and her daughter, Natalie. The Raanans, released on Oct. 20, have not spoken publicly about their ordeal."
82,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/world/middleeast/israel-west-bank-air-strike-mosque.html,"The Israeli military carried out a rare airstrike on a mosque in the occupied West Bank overnight, killing at least two people in what Palestinian officials called a “dangerous escalation.”

The strike hit a mosque in the densely packed Palestinian refugee camp of Jenin in the northern West Bank. Israel’s military said it was targeting an underground “terror compound” beneath the mosque that it said was being used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad to organize an imminent attack. Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, called the activity going on beneath the mosque a “ticking time bomb.” The claims had not been independently verified.

At least two people were killed and three others were injured, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Video from the scene showed significant damage to the mosque.

The Palestinian Foreign Ministry called the strike a “dangerous escalation in the use of warplanes,” saying in a statement that Israel appeared to be bringing tactics used in the Gaza Strip to the occupied West Bank.

After a lull of nearly two decades, Israel resumed limited airstrikes in the West Bank in July, mostly by means of drones, during a two-day siege and assault on the Jenin refugee camp which the Israeli military said was aimed at rooting out armed groups.

Violence has been surging in the West Bank in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks that Hamas, the armed group that controls Gaza, launched against Israel. The Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank said 90 Palestinians had been killed since Oct. 7 in the occupied territory in clashes with Israeli forces and attacks by armed Israeli settlers, by far the most in any two consecutive weeks this year. Israeli officers have arrested hundreds of Palestinians, according to Palestinian and Israeli accounts.

At least 52 Palestinians were arrested by Israeli security forces overnight during wide-scale raids, Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, reported on Sunday. It said that most of the arrests were concentrated in and around the central city of Ramallah in the West Bank, adding that one of the detainees was Islam Al Tawil — the mayor of Al-Bireh, a city abutting Ramallah, and a former prisoner in Israeli jails."
83,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/us/politics/house-israel-vote.html,"The House voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to pass a resolution declaring solidarity with Israel, pledging to give its government whatever security assistance it needs to fight and win its war with Hamas.

The vote, 412 to 10, was the first piece of legislation considered under Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana. He was elected to the post on Wednesday after three tumultuous weeks in which G.O.P. members struggled to replace Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, following his ouster.

Nine Democrats and one Republican opposed the resolution. Six Democrats voted present, even though five of them had previously co-sponsored the resolution.

The vote reflected the sweeping, bipartisan support that lawmakers have voiced for Israel’s efforts to rout Hamas from the Gaza Strip, which it seized control of in 2007, in retaliation for its attacks of Oct. 7 that killed more than 1,400 civilians and soldiers.

But it also reflected the defiance of a small but determined minority of House Democrats who have called for a cease-fire, arguing that Israel’s bombing campaign of Gaza has caused the deaths of too many Palestinians. The Hamas-run Gazan health ministry says Israeli strikes have killed more than 6,500 people, a number that could not be independently verified.

The resolution asserts Israel’s right to defend itself, condemns Hamas and calls for the release of hostages it seized. It was written by Representatives Michael McCaul of Texas and Gregory W. Meeks of New York, the Republican chairman and top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee. It is similar to a resolution expressing solidarity with Israel that the Senate adopted unanimously last week.

“It condemns in the strongest possible terms the atrocities of Hamas and reiterates Israel’s right to defend herself along with America’s unwavering support for the state of Israel,” Mr. McCaul said on the House floor, arguing the resolution “will send a clear message across the world that terrorists and their sponsors will be held to account.”

“This Congress will have Israel’s back as it degrades and eliminates Hamas terrorist infrastructure,” Mr. Meeks said on the floor. “We will not waver, we will not quit, we will stand with our ally Israel.”

While both the House and Senate resolutions pledged to provide Israel with military, intelligence, diplomatic and other forms of assistance, they do not fund weapons and other forms of aid. That fight is still to come, as lawmakers dissect President Biden’s request for $105 billion in emergency funds to address national security issues, including the wars in Israel and Ukraine, the mounting threat China poses to Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific region, and the security of the U.S.-Mexico border.

House lawmakers are starting a step behind because of the speaker drama, which has paralyzed the chamber for most of this month. No legislation could be moved while Republicans fought through deep fractures in the conference, finally electing a new speaker after three other nominees had failed.

Several Republicans have called for separating the $14.3 billion of security aid Mr. Biden requested for Israel from the rest of the package, arguing that the urgency of Israel’s war and the bipartisan interest in helping the Jewish state should not be hamstrung by partisan discord that has arisen around Ukraine aid. Last month, over half of House Republicans voted against a bill to send $300 million in weapons and training to Ukrainian fighters.

Many Republicans have also argued that the package’s border security provisions need to be more extensive. Some G.O.P. lawmakers have also raised objections to the humanitarian aid Mr. Biden’s package would direct to Palestinian civilians, expressing concerns that it would end up in the hands of Hamas.

Those simmering partisan divisions were largely sidelined during debate about the Israel resolution, which Republicans and Democrats alike hailed as an important message of unified support for Israel.

But one Republican accused the lawmakers who voted against the resolution of cowardice and complicity in compromising Israel’s security.

“They are not worthy of serving in this body,” said Representative Mike Lawler, Republican of New York. “If you cannot stand with Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East, a beacon of democracy, hope and freedom, you do not belong in this body — those members should resign in disgrace.”

One of the resolution’s opponents, Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, defended her vote as a protest against what she said was its unfairness.

“I voted against this resolution because it is a deeply incomplete and biased account of what is happening in Israel and Palestine, and what has been happening for decades,” Ms. Tlaib said in a statement. “This resolution rightly mourns the thousands of Israeli civilians killed and wounded in the horrific attacks but explicitly does not mourn the thousands of Palestinian civilians, including over 2,000 children, killed and wounded in the collective punishment of Palestine.”"
84,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/business/israel-central-bank-war-economy.html,"The war between Israel and Hamas will abruptly slow the Israeli economy this year and next and send the nation’s budget deficit soaring as the country ramps up spending to support the military, civilians and businesses during the conflict, the Bank of Israel said on Monday.

Many businesses have been forced to pause activity, and hundreds of thousands of Israeli reservists are now on active duty, while many people are in shelters. If the war stays on Israel’s southern front, economic growth will cool to an annual rate of 2.3 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2024 from an expected 3 percent growth pace for both years forecast in August, the bank said in a report after its first monetary meeting since the conflict broke out.

“We knew how to recover in difficult times in the past, and I have no doubt that this will be the case this time as well,” the governor of the Bank of Israel, Amir Yaron, said in a news conference in Jerusalem. Even so, he added, “it is clear that a shorter or longer duration, as well as any developments of the war to additional arenas,” would add uncertainty to the economic outlook.

The conflict has dealt a fresh blow to a resilient economy that until recently had been hailed as an entrepreneurial powerhouse. Israel had low debt, a current account surplus and high foreign exchange reserves, although growth had begun to slow amid high interest rates, rising inflation and expectations of a slowdown in the global economy.

In its report, the bank said that Israel’s financial markets were functioning, and that much of the country’s economic activity was continuing “as usual.”

But the shekel, Israel’s currency, which had already been on a downward trend since the start of the year, has slumped even further since the war started, to an eight-year low, prompting the central bank to earmark $30 billion in foreign exchange to support it. The shekel fell an additional 0.1 percent against the U.S. dollar Monday.

Two credit ratings agencies warned last week that Israel’s debt could be downgraded, depending on the severity and length of the conflict. But the central bank said Monday that Israel’s banking system “remains stable and robust.”

The central bank had been facing a quandary: Reduce interest rates to help bolster the wartime economy, or keep them elevated to support the shekel. On Monday, the bank chose the latter: It kept interest rates unchanged, adding that its policy was focused on “stabilizing the markets and reducing uncertainty.”

Israel’s debt as a percentage of the economy is expected to rise sharply, reflecting an increase in spending on defense that includes what the bank said would be financial support “to conduct the war in accordance with the goals defined for it.”

With the economy hit and people called to the fight, tax revenues were expected to decline, the central bank added. Consumer spending was already lower, as was activity in the construction, agriculture and tourism industries, the bank said.

At the same time, the government has pledged to spend more to support people and businesses, including housing evacuees from combat zones. Banks and credit card companies, under the government’s direction, are providing repayment deferrals and other financial aid to help households and companies.

The government will also offer grants and state-backed loans to small and midsize businesses, and is creating a fund to help businesses cover fixed expenses, including employee salaries.

All that was expected to help keep the Israeli economy stable, the bank said. Even so, “the forecast is accompanied by particularly high uncertainty,” it added."
85,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/world/middleeast/jack-lew-ambassador-israel.html,"As President Biden visited Israel on Wednesday to pledge U.S. support in its fight against Hamas, his nominee to fill the conspicuously empty American ambassador’s post to the country faced Republican opposition at home.

The nomination of Jacob J. Lew, who served as Treasury secretary during the Obama administration, was announced last month but has gained urgency since Hamas attackers slaughtered at least 1,400 Israelis on Oct. 7. The attacks prompted Israel to launch an intensive bombing campaign against the Gaza Strip, which is governed by Hamas.

But despite pleas from the Biden administration and leading Democrats to confirm Mr. Lew quickly, most Republican senators on the Foreign Relations Committee expressed opposition to his confirmation, arguing he was unfit for the post because of his past work on a multinational deal to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions.

“We need this thing filled. The problem I have is that it needs to be filled with the right person,” Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the panel, said during Mr. Lew’s confirmation hearing Wednesday. He accused Mr. Lew of acting in “what I think was a backhanded way of supporting Iran.”

As Treasury secretary, Mr. Lew played a key role in negotiating and promoting a deal that eased sanctions on Iran’s nuclear sector in exchange for Tehran’s accepting limitations on its nuclear enrichment and related activities. But Republicans charge that Mr. Lew lied to lawmakers at the time about how the deal would be implemented, particularly when it came to access to previously frozen funds to Iran, which they believe Iran used to build up terrorist proxy groups posing a threat to Israel, including Hamas.

The Republican opposition is not expected to kill Mr. Lew’s candidacy. Democrats — who expressed support for him — hold a majority on the panel. But it could complicate efforts to get his bid through the full Senate quickly, by forcing Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, to use time-consuming procedural maneuvers to set up a vote.

Israel has lacked a Senate-confirmed U.S. ambassador since Thomas R. Nides left the post in July. Mr. Schumer and other Democrats have warned that continuing to leave the post empty would be detrimental to the United States’ ability to support Israel.

“Delaying him would be egregious at a time like this,” Mr. Schumer said Tuesday of Mr. Lew on the floor, adding that the nominee was “a ferocious ally of Israel.”

Mr. Lew sought to display his pro-Israel bona fides on Wednesday, telling senators about his Jewish family’s Zionist roots and listing his efforts as Treasury secretary to impose and enforce sanctions against both Hamas and Iran.

“I cannot remember a time when Israel’s struggle for security was not at the forefront of my mind,” Mr. Lew said. He added: “Iran is a threat to regional stability and to Israel’s existence. If confirmed, I will uphold President Biden’s commitment to deny Iran a nuclear weapon.”

But his declarations did little to deter Republican senators.

Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, accused Mr. Lew of having kept secret from Congress a license that would have allowed Iran to convert funds held at a bank in Oman into euros, and pressured banks around the world to do business with Tehran, citing the findings from a 2018 report from Republicans on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, accused Mr. Lew of acting as the Iranian government’s banker by negotiating deals to release funds in exchange for American prisoners.

“The massive influx of cash was ultimately a direct deposit into Iran’s terrorism account,” Mr. Barrasso said.

Mr. Lew argued that he had adhered strictly to the terms of the deal easing nuclear-related sanctions, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — and frustrated officials in Tehran by refusing to go any further.

“They complained that my actions were what kept them from getting full access to the world financial system,” he said. “We did the letter of the J.C.P.O.A., nothing more.”

If confirmed as ambassador, Mr. Lew will be starting at a time of heightened fears that the conflict between Israel and Hamas might engulf the region, potentially even pulling in U.S. forces.

“Preventing this from becoming a multifront war is hugely important for Israel, for the region, for the world,” he said. He added that bringing home the Americans thought to be hostages of Hamas would be one of his top priorities. At least 13 Americans are unaccounted for, according to the State Department, but it is unclear how many are being held hostage.

Yet Mr. Lew conceded that longer-term goals such as the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, and an eventual two-state solution with the Palestinians, would probably have to wait until hostilities died down.

He also promised that he would do his utmost to ensure that civilians in Gaza receive humanitarian assistance, drawing a distinction between them and Hamas militants.

But he resisted Democrats’ efforts to get him to urge the Israelis to exercise restraint.

“This is not the time for us to be lecturing Israel on what they need to do,” Mr. Lew said, adding that Israeli officials knew they had to conduct the war “in a way that is consistent with minimizing the impact on innocent civilians.”"

87,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/arts/92ny-viet-thanh-nguyen-israel.html,"92NY, one of New York City’s premier cultural venues, decided on Friday to abruptly pull an event that evening featuring the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen after he signed an open letter critical of Israel, drawing criticism that the organization was stifling dissenting voices.

The event at 92NY, formerly known as the 92nd Street Y, was to have featured Nguyen in conversation with the novelist Min Jin Lee about his new memoir, “A Man of Two Faces,” in an auditorium on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that seats roughly 900. But on Friday afternoon, after the Y said it would no longer go ahead with the event, the talk’s organizer, Bernard Schwartz, who leads the Y’s poetry center, moved it to a bookstore in Lower Manhattan where it drew a standing-room crowd of about 100.

In a statement on Saturday, 92NY said the event had simply been postponed.

“We are a Jewish institution that has always welcomed people with diverse viewpoints to our stage,” the statement said. “The brutal Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel and the continued holding of hostages, including senior citizens and young children, has absolutely devastated the community. Given the public comments by the invited author on Israel and this moment, we felt the responsible course of action was to postpone the event while we take some time to determine how best to use our platform and support the entire 92NY community.”

But the participants see it otherwise. At the relocated event, Nguyen described the Y’s decision, which he said he was informed of around 2 p.m. that afternoon, as a “cancellation.”

No explanation had been given, he said. But he said he assumed it was a response to the fact that he was among the more than 750 writers and artists who signed an open letter published in The London Review of Books on Wednesday that was highly critical of Israel.

In his introduction at the event, Schwartz, who has led 92NY’s Unterberg Poetry Center since 2005, called the Y’s decision “unacceptable.” Both Nguyen and Lee, he noted, have engaged with questions of war, memory, identity and trauma in their work.

“Who else in a moment like this would you want to hear from?” he asked.

The event was the latest example of cultural fallout over the Israel-Hamas war, which has led to complex debates across college campuses and cultural organizations about free expression, solidarity and the limits of permitted debate over Israel. Events featuring Palestinian artists or culture have been canceled, some statements of support for Palestinians have drawn debate and the leaders of some institutions have been criticized for what is seen as the failure to adequately acknowledge either Hamas’s murder of Israeli civilians or Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.

In an interview after the event, Schwartz said that he, like his colleagues, had been monitoring letters and petitions, “both as someone who works at the Y, and as a human being trying to grasp what’s happening.”

He said that on Thursday afternoon, he had flagged the long-planned event with Nguyen to the Y’s leadership. He said he noted both the open letter in The London Review of Books and Nguyen’s public support for the movement to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel, known as B.D.S. That support, Schwartz noted, predates other events Nguyen has done over the years at 92NY, without incident.

Schwartz said that on Thursday evening, Seth Pinsky, 92NY’s chief executive, called a meeting with the board’s executive committee. Afterward, Schwartz said, he was told there would be further discussion about whether the event would go forward.

At around 2 p.m. on Friday, he said, he was told to call Nguyen to discuss “postponing” the event. “I refused to do that,” Schwartz said. Instead, he arranged to hold the event at the McNally Jackson bookstore on Fulton Street.

Introducing the event at the bookstore, Schwartz held up a promotional brochure that the Y sent out this summer featuring Nguyen’s face and the words “The Writers Who Inspire Us, the Books That Define Us.”

“What’s changed between August and today at 2 p.m. that means that artists and thinkers and moral leaders like Viet and Min can’t come to the Y?” he asked. “I’m going to just let that question sit there.”

The letter Nguyen signed, titled “An Open Letter on the Situation in Palestine,” calls for an end to the “unprecedented and indiscriminate violence” by Israel in Gaza, including “grave crimes against humanity.” It has drawn sharp criticism from some for not naming Hamas at all, while making only oblique reference to the Oct. 7 attacks that left roughly 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians, dead.

On Thursday, Nguyen posted a statement on Instagram about his reasons for signing the letter.

“The Israeli government and its supporters have sought to shut down any protest of Israel, including nonviolent ones like B.D.S., which helps lead to the current situation where some can only see violence as a solution,” he wrote. “Even literature and the arts from Palestinians or sympathetic to them are being silenced.”

92NY’s decision to pull the event drew concern from free expression organizations. Suzanne Nossel, the chief executive of PEN America, said that in times of war and conflict, writers were particularly important as “bridges across schisms.”

“As a literary and cultural community, as hard as it is, I think we really have to play that role of continuing to be open to all voices, and not to back off even when it’s really difficult,” she said.

92NY was founded in 1874 as the Young Men’s Hebrew Association, with the goal of serving “the social and spiritual needs of the American Jewish community,” according to its website.

In the 20th century, the organization transformed into the 92nd Street Y, a culture and arts organization widely known to New Yorkers as “the Y.” Last year, as it began a $200 million renovation, it rebranded itself as “92NY.” It also hired a rabbi, in order to “more publicly assert our Jewish identity” at a moment of rising antisemitism, Pinsky, its chief executive, said at the time.

The Unterberg Poetry Center, founded in 1939, is one of the country’s most storied literary venues, whose roster of speakers has included Dylan Thomas, Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Philip Roth, Margaret Atwood and other luminaries.

During the event at the bookstore on Friday, Lee said she and Nguyen held “absolutely no ill will” toward 92NY, where she had taken six writing classes over the years. “Whatever happened today, it should not in any way invoke any sentiment against Jewish people in New York,” she said emphatically.

“Whenever we think of any institution and any nation, I hope we remember it’s made up of individuals,” she said. “There’s always that plurality.”

Schwartz said afterward that he was “heartbroken” by what had happened, and noted the organization’s packed schedule of upcoming events.

“What other events will the Y say can no longer happen on its stages?” he asked."
88,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/style/israel-war-civilian-aid.html,"“Finally, I felt like I can breathe,” she went on. “Because it is unbelievably depressing to be at home. You can’t avoid looking at the television all the time. I don’t think there’s one person in Israel who doesn’t have immediate relation to someone who was killed or injured. My daughter is 18, and she’s about to be drafted in a month and a half. She’s at a funeral of a friend that was in the party in the desert. I don’t let myself think or get emotional because I would break. I think all of us are in this situation right now because this is what we need to do.”

Not long after the attack, the security forces reached out to the head of Shenkar’s textile innovation center. They needed help making special equipment — not clothing, but accessories. (The Shenkar team was not exactly sure what they were, though they thought they were an element of multipurpose gear.)

After approval from the Shenkar administration, Ms. Arazi enlisted colleagues in the project and, she said, “I just WhatsApped our group of other lecturers and said, ‘Help is needed. Who wants to come and see what can we do?’”

“Everyone feels that they want to contribute in some manner,” she continued.

The other organizers include Ofir Ivgi, a fashion designer and lecturer; Anna Solo, a technical supervisor, recently returned from the funeral of one of her son’s friends; and Ilan Beja, the head of the fashion design department, whose brother had been hiding in a besieged kibbutz for 12 hours without water or electricity before being rescued."
89,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/us/politics/israel-ukraine-weapons.html,"With his prime-time vow to send more weapons to both Ukraine and Israel, President Biden sought to make clear on Thursday that the United States was not prioritizing one war over the other.

But hours earlier, a Defense Department official said that tens of thousands of 155-millimeter artillery shells promised to Ukraine would be diverted to Israel.

The shells are an example of the American weapons that officials and experts say are needed in both wars, which could stretch the U.S. capacity to keep up with demand. That will be especially true if Israel’s expected ground offensive in Gaza, in response to Hamas attacks, lasts for months.

“You’re going to probably see a steady flow of weapons continuing to flow into Israel,” Sabrina Singh, the deputy Pentagon spokeswoman, said last week.

Some of those shipments could include the same types of artillery and bombs that Ukraine has relied on in its own 20-month ground war to defend its territory from Russia.

For the most part, Ukraine and Israel are fighting different kinds of wars, and have different capabilities and needs, according to current and former U.S. national security and congressional officials.

In recent months, Ukraine’s counteroffensive has faced stiff resistance from Russian mines, trenches and other defenses, and the grinding artillery campaign has devolved into a war of attrition.

Israel is preparing to launch a very different kind of land war — an urban fight in the densely populated Gaza Strip, which has been pummeled by Israeli airstrikes since Hamas’s attacks on Oct. 7.

“There’ll be very little overlap between what we’re going to be giving Israel and what we give to Ukraine,” Michael J. Morell, former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said last week.

Ukraine is poised to receive about $61 billion in new military aid, more than half of a $105 billion emergency package of mostly foreign assistance that Mr. Biden wants Congress to approve. Israel, whose military is far better equipped than Ukraine’s, would receive about $14 billion for its air and missile defenses in the proposal, which the White House announced on Friday.

Still, with global stockpiles of 155-millimeter shells and other weapons systems already thinned out, and manufacturers struggling to keep up with demand, “there will be trade-offs” in supplying both wars the longer they last, Mark F. Cancian, a former White House weapons strategist who is now a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington wrote in an analysis.

Here are three key weapons systems that Israel and Ukraine may need from the United States.

Artillery ammunition

Perhaps more than any other weapons, the NATO-standard 155-millimeter shells will be in high demand, as both Israel and Ukraine use them against targets within a few dozen miles.

The United States has sent Ukraine more than two million 155-millimeter rounds, and Europe has delivered hundreds of thousands more, since Russia’s invasion in February 2022. But Western military stockpiles are now nearing “the bottom of the barrel,” a top official in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Adm. Rob Bauer of the Netherlands, recently said.

In January, the Pentagon said it would tap into an American stockpile in Israel and ship hundreds of thousands of 155-millimeter shells to Ukraine. The stockpile is located in Israel, the closest American ally in the Middle East, to quickly supply arms across the region when needed.

About half of the shells in the stockpile in Israel were shipped out last winter. The Pentagon now plans to redirect at least some of the rest to Israel’s military, the Defense Department official said.

Maj. Charlie Dietz, a Pentagon spokesman, declined to discuss the details of any munitions transfer but said the top U.S. priority “was ensuring Israel has the resources it needs during this time.”"

91,https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000009141800/biden-israel-ukraine-congress-budget.html,"Good evening, my fellow Americans. We’re facing an inflection point in history: one of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come. I know these conflicts can seem far away, and it’s natural to ask, Why does this matter to America? So let me share with you why making sure Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital for America’s national security. You know, history has taught us that when terrorists don’t pay a price for their terror, when dictators don’t pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction. American leadership is what holds the world together. American alliances is what keeps us, America, safe. American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with. To put all that at risk – if we walk away from Ukraine, if we turn our backs on Israel - it’s just not worth it. That’s why tomorrow I’m going to send to Congress an urgent budget request to fund America’s national security needs, to support our critical partners including Israel and Ukraine. I know we have our divisions at home. We have to get past them. We can’t let petty, partisan, angry politics get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nation. We cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win. I refuse to let that happen. In moments like these, we have to remind, we have to remember who we are: We are the United States of America. United States of America. And there is nothing – nothing – beyond our capacity, if we do it together. My fellow Americans, thank you for your time. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops."
92,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/world/middleeast/bloomberg-israel-donation.html,"Michael Bloomberg said on Monday that he would donate nearly $44 million to Magen David Adom, Israel’s nonprofit emergency medical service, after the Hamas attacks on civilians and soldiers on Oct. 7.

The former New York City mayor and billionaire philanthropist said he planned to match contributions he solicited through an email appeal for the American Friends of Magen David Adom. The total amounts to an $88 million gift, the largest in the American organization’s history.

“America has always been a friend to Israel and I am encouraged that so many of us are stepping up to help our ally during these challenging times,” Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement. “It is important to show the world that we are united in our condemnation of Hamas and committed to protecting the health and safety of all Israelis.”

Magen David Adom, often known as the Israeli Red Cross, functions as Israel’s emergency medical system, blood bank and disaster response organization. The new funds will help buy ambulances, medical equipment and ballistic vests and helmets for emergency workers, said Catherine Reed, chief executive of American Friends of Magen David Adom. Last week, the organization airlifted 17 new ambulances to Israel and plans to ship more in the coming days.

Mr. Bloomberg has supported the organization for several decades, giving several million dollars to finance an emergency medical station and blood donation center in Jerusalem named for his late father, William H. Bloomberg. He also funded a health center at Hadassah University Medical Center dedicated to his mother, Charlotte R. Bloomberg.

Still, his latest contribution is a significant expansion of efforts from a donor who has largely focused his giving on domestic issues, including gun control, immigration and urban policy.

Mark Lebow, the chairman of the American Friends of Magen David Adom and a longtime associate of Mr. Bloomberg, reached out to the former mayor shortly after the attacks to ask for a financial contribution. The scale of the response to his request for matching gifts surprised Mr. Bloomberg and his team, who initially anticipated raising perhaps a quarter of the total, according to Mr. Bloomberg’s aides.

Over the 11 days of their appeal, nearly 34,000 donors gave. The giving spanned the country, from large donors funding ambulances to children hosting bake sales and lemonade stand fund-raisers, the organization said.

“I don’t think we ever imagined the match would be something like this,” Ms. Reed said. “This is quite a transformational gift.”"
93,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/opinion/hamas-israel-kibbutz-attack.html,"After Hamas attacked their country this month, many Israelis fled to hotels, where they sought some version of safety. There, they’ve been processing their trauma as they move from that harrowing morning into a new world. In the Opinion video above, filmed in the days after the attack, survivors reflect on what they lost, whom they blame and what’s next — for them and for Israel.

Despite being at war, polling from the Israel Democracy Institute suggests that Israelis are more optimistic about the future of their country now than they’ve been at any other point this year. Still, for the residents of Kibbutz Kfar Aza, where more than 100 Israelis were killed, any optimism they had before the attack has been replaced by an uncertain future. Here, Israelis grapple with what can be recovered and what is lost forever. That includes a fundamental loss of faith in a defense system that didn’t work. As one asked of her government, “Why didn’t you protect me?”"
94,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/us/politics/tim-scott-israel-ukraine-aid.html,"Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina said on Sunday that he would not support a request from President Biden to package aid for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan and funding for border security, even though he has endorsed U.S. spending for each of those purposes.

“I believe that leveraging the challenges in the war with Israel to get more assistance for Ukraine at that level of $60 billion is too much, and we need to have a single focus on bringing Congress together behind the support for Israel,” Mr. Scott, a 2024 Republican candidate, said on “This Week” on ABC News.

At first, he indicated that his objection was mainly to the possibility of delaying aid to Israel by combining it with funding on which Congress is more divided. He said that he believed aid to Israel alone “would pass overnight,” and that a “splintered” package would be harder to pass.

But when the interviewer, Jonathan Karl, asked whether he would actually vote against the package if it came to the Senate floor, Mr. Scott said he would."
95,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/us/politics/desantis-nikki-haley-israel.html,"With that upward climb, she has come under more scrutiny. After the second debate last month, the former president attacked her as a “birdbrain” on social media, and Ms. Haley accused his campaign of sending a birdcage and birdseed to her hotel.

Though Mr. DeSantis has drawn attacks from his rivals on the debate stage — including some from Ms. Haley — he has largely avoided initiating heated exchanges, a stance in keeping with his long-running insistence that the primary is a two-candidate contest between him and Mr. Trump. But Ms. Haley’s surge — and her decision to focus her fire on the Florida governor — have clearly forced the DeSantis campaign and its allies to recalculate.

Mr. DeSantis’s super PAC, Never Back Down, reported spending nearly $1 million against Ms. Haley this week, after devoting just $29,000 to anti-Haley messaging during the first half of the year.

The recent exchanges were spurred by dueling television appearances over the weekend on the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Last week, Mr. DeSantis doubled down on his opposition to helping some of the nearly one million people contending with shortages of food, clean water and shelter in the region. He described the culture in the Gaza Strip as “toxic” and argued that the people of Gaza “teach kids to hate Jews.” Ms. Haley pushed back against this view, saying that large percentages of Palestinians did not support Hamas and that “America has always been sympathetic to the fact that you can separate civilians from terrorists.” (Polling in Gaza supports Ms. Haley’s claim.)

But in an interview on Fox News on Tuesday, Mr. DeSantis cast her words as evidence that she supported allowing refugees from Gaza to come to the United States. The Never Back Down ad from this week spliced the clips from Ms. Haley with comments from Mr. DeSantis criticizing her in an NBC interview. “She’s trying to be politically correct,” he says in the ad. “She’s trying to please the media and people on the left.”

Ms. Haley’s campaign has countered with several emails to supporters and the news media, citing fact checkers who have found that Mr. DeSantis got her statements wrong and rejecting what her campaign officials have described as Mr. DeSantis’s consistent mischaracterizations of her statements and her record.

Spokespeople for both Mr. DeSantis’s campaign and Never Back Down maintain that their critiques of Ms. Haley are accurate.

As governor, Ms. Haley at times voiced the need for the United States to be a welcoming nation for immigrants and refugees. In 2015, she supported the efforts of faith groups to resettle people in South Carolina. But Ms. Haley took an aggressive stance against resettling Syrians in her state after the terror attacks in Paris that same year, citing gaps in intelligence that could make the vetting process difficult.

Now, under fire from Mr. DeSantis, her campaign has underscored her hard-line track record as governor on immigration policies and portrayed her as nothing but staunchly opposed to taking in people from the Middle East. “The truth is, Haley has always opposed settling Middle East refugees in America, believing that Arab countries in the region should absorb them,” read one email to reporters.

The disputes highlight how even as Republicans remain divided on other features of Mr. Trump’s isolationist “America First” agenda, they have unified behind its hard-line approach to immigration and the nation’s borders, with Mr. DeSantis and Ms. Haley largely aligned in their calls to keep out refugees from the conflict zone.

It is widely seen as unlikely that Gazan refugees will be headed for the United States anytime soon. Still, at a DeSantis campaign event in South Carolina on Thursday, the crowd applauded when Mr. DeSantis pledged that as president, he would accept “zero” people from Gaza, adding that he opposed “importing the pathologies of the Middle East to our country.” He also said that any American aid sent to Gaza would end up in the hands of Hamas.

Rick McConnell, a 70-year-old Air Force veteran who heard Mr. DeSantis speak, said he understood that Gazans needed food, water and medical supplies. But Mr. McConnell said that Iran — which he believed was responsible for Hamas’s brutal attacks — should provide that aid.

“Why can’t they help them?” Mr. McConnell said. “We have veterans sleeping on the streets — our veterans.”

The concerns were echoed at Ms. Haley’s events. “If you are living in Gaza, I don’t think you love America or are Christian,” said Corrine Rothchild, 69, a retired elementary school teacher who was still weighing her vote between Ms. Haley and Mr. DeSantis.

Mr. DeSantis, who served on the Foreign Affairs Committee during his time in the House of Representatives, has sought to distinguish himself on foreign policy, pointing to restrictions he signed in Florida that banned land purchases by many Chinese nationals and calling for the use of military force against Mexican drug cartels. In the last week, he also has used state funds to charter flights that have brought home hundreds of Americans stranded in Israel.

Ms. Haley also has sought to make her foreign policy credentials, her hawkish stances on China and her staunch support of Israel central to her campaign. As Mr. Trump’s United Nations ambassador, Ms. Haley forcefully spoke out in support of his formal recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, as well as his decision to cut American funding to Palestinian refugees.

The two have sparred on foreign policy before. She has criticized Mr. DeSantis for his support of Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and his hold on military nominations over a policy that covers the travel expenses of service members who seek reproductive health care services, including abortions, in other states. She also attacked Mr. DeSantis’s stance on the war in Ukraine, which he called a “territorial dispute” that was not central to U.S. interests — a characterization he later walked back.

In recent days, both have also turned their scorn on Mr. Trump for remarks that he made after the Hamas attack criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and referring to Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group, as “very smart.” Mr. Trump has since retreated from his comments. He, too, has pledged to reject refugees from Gaza."
96,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-israel-palestine.html,"Biden’s State Department released a memo to its diplomats warning them not to use phrases like “an end to violence” or “bloodshed,” not to call for a ceasefire fire or even for calm.

Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defense minister, said, “We are fighting human animals and are acting accordingly.” Israeli Major General Ghassan Alian warned, “There will be no electricity and no water. There will only be destruction. You wanted hell. You will get hell.” Senator Lindsey Graham said that Israel should, quote, “level the place.” And of the civilian death toll that could bring, he said, “Every death going forward, I blame on Hamas, not Israel.”

And there’s a purpose to that — there always is. What can and cannot be said shapes what can and cannot be done. So it’s worth listening to what the people in power are saying right now.

I read and heard more about the idiocy of student groups and random academics than about what the right response here actually was. And it’s tempting to call that a distraction or a waste of time or a derangement driven by social media. But it’s not. This, too, was an echo of what happened in America after 9/11, that era of flag pins and freedom fries. Cancel culture is endlessly debated today, but the boundaries of speech and the penalties for stepping over them were stronger then.

In the days after Hamas’s attack, I was in Tokyo, of all places. I was far from the people I would gather with to grieve and to process and to hurt. So I was confined to following along online, which I don’t recommend. And what was so striking was to see how fast we were turning on each other, how we became obsessed not with what should actually be done or even what was actually being done, but with what was and could be said and by whom.

Our politics still haven’t recovered from the ravages of that era. It was, in large part, the invasion of Iraq that discredited the Republican Party’s leadership class, leading directly to the rise of Donald Trump. 9/11 created a permission structure in American politics to do incredibly stupid brutal things, and we are still paying the costs. Perhaps we always will be.

And in response, we shredded our own liberties. We invaded Afghanistan. We invaded Iraq. Our response to 9/11 led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people. It made us weaker. It made us poorer. It made us hated around the world. We didn’t pull our forces out of Afghanistan until 2021, 20 years later. And when we left, we did so in humiliation and catastrophe and defeat, abandoning the country to the Taliban.

Israel’s 9/11 — that’s been the refrain. And I fear that analogy carries more truth than the people making it want it to. Because what was 9/11? It was an attack that drowned an entire country — our country, my country, America — in terror and in rage. It drove us mad with fear.

The first thing that my mother asked me when she saw me after Hamas’s massacre in Israel was to promise that I wouldn’t write or talk about it publicly, that I wouldn’t make myself a target for some violent anti-Semite. I had that conversation with her just a day or two after talking to my friends about whether or not they were going to keep their children home that week because their kids go to daycare at a synagogue, and they’re worried the daycare would be bombed or that an armed shooter would open fire. That should give you a sense of what it’s felt like to be Jewish in recent weeks.

So look, I’ve seen some of those statements this weekend. And we’re going to continue to be very clear. We believe they’re wrong. We believe they’re repugnant. And we believe they’re disgraceful. Our condemnation belongs squarely with terrorists who have brutally murdered, raped, kidnapped hundreds — hundreds of Israelis. There can be no equivocation about that. There are not two sides here. There are not two sides.

Well, there have been some members of Congress who have called for a ceasefire and they have not gone as far as backing the administration’s call for support for Israel.

In a way, it was almost inevitable, fitting, that George W. Bush himself would re-emerge to apply the logic of 9/11 to the moment. This from a video posted by Axios:

But hundreds of thousands of Gazan residents are being driven from their homes at pain of death in an Israeli airstrike. They know, and we know, they may have only rubble to return to. They know, and we know, that that is part of the point of this policy. When the Biden administration says there are not two sides here, in that framework, which side are these people fleeing their homes on? And more to the point, who is on their side?

Notice the change there right at the end from where our condemnation belongs to whether there are two sides in this. I would say there are so many more than two sides. Israel is itself a fractious and divided country. There are countless Palestinians who loathe Hamas. But the point being made here is just the opposite, that there is only one side, at least right now.

My thoughts were that we need to support Israel. No ands, ifs or buts. This was an unprovoked attack by terrorist people willing to kill innocent people to achieve an objective. Hamas is a political organization. They do not reflect the majority of the Palestinians. And don’t be surprised if Israel takes whatever action is necessary to defend herself. And it’s going to be ugly for a while.

If you follow Bush’s reasoning closely there, it’s a remarkably telling statement. Hamas does not reflect the majority of Palestinians. But Israel’s reprisal needs to be supported without any ands, or ifs or buts, ugly as it may be, implicitly whatever it may be.

What was so repulsive to me in some leftist commentary after Hamas’s massacre of Israelis was a belief in collective guilt and collective punishment. There was no debate over whether Hamas targeted and slaughtered civilians. No, the argument was that there was no such thing as an Israeli civilian. No such thing as being an innocent in Israel. It’s repugnant. But does the repugnance of that logic not go both ways? Is there no such thing as a civilian in Gaza?

And put aside the morality of the collective punishment being meted out on Gaza, what of its wisdom? Will this reduce support for Hamas or something yet worse than Hamas? If so, then why did Hamas want to goad Israel into it — into raising and possibly reoccupying Gaza? They were not unclear that launching a massive attack capped by a pogrom that they spread videos of and then taking hostages, they were not unclear about whether or not that would elicit an overwhelming Israeli response.

What Hussein Ibish wrote in The Atlantic reads as obviously true to me. Quote, “Iran and Hamas are counting on Israel to attack Gaza with such ferocity that the international sympathy of the past week toward Israel, even in the Arab world, evaporates quickly and is replaced by outrage at the suffering inflicted on the two million residents of Gaza,” end quote.

Why might Hamas want this? Why would we not want to at least loudly ask that question? How do we make sure they do not get what they want? And what does or should Israel want beside vengeance?

And I want to be clear about this. I think vengeance is a legitimate and even necessary goal here. It cannot be safe — it cannot be safe to murder Israeli civilians. But vengeance cannot be the only goal. Israelis, no less than Palestinians, deserve peace and security. Those need to be considerations, too. And that requires considering things.

I’ve been thinking lately about something that Spencer Ackerman, author of the book “Reign of Terror,” which is, I think, the best book by far on how 9/11 deranged America — something that he said, which is that the essence of the politics of 9/11 was, quote, “to make scandalous the presentation of context.” “To make scandalous the presentation of context.”

There’s a deep truth to that — to add context is in this kind of regime of thought, to undermine the purity of condemnation, to add sides. That’s an absurd way to think. The brutal facts of the occupation, the architecture of control, and humiliation, and checkpoints and work permits and blockades that Palestinians live under, it does not justify Hamas’s murders. But it helps explain Hamas’s strength, its persistent appeal to at least some of the Palestinian people. Hamas is built on Palestinian despair. And if you radically increase Palestinian fury and despair, if you create a new wave, a new generation of fathers who lost their sons, and brothers who lost their sisters, and people now dedicated to revenge, have you actually made Israel safer, or have you made Hamas or something like it stronger?

Hardliners feed on each other. Hamas’s political strength has been an excellent excuse for Netanyahu’s government to abandon even the pretense of a real peace process. If Hamas is on the other side of the table, then there can be no peace process because there is no partner for peace. Israel is right that it cannot make peace with Hamas, that Hamas’s actual aim is Israel’s eradication.

That helped justify the path Israel has chosen in recent years, a policy that tried to achieve safety through subjugation. This vast architecture of walls, and missile defense systems, and intelligence operations, and checkpoints, and imprisonments. The promise of all this was not justice. It was security.

Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s Minister of National Security, once said, quote, “My right, my wife’s, my children’s, to roam the roads of Judea and Samaria are more important than the right of movement of the Arabs.” That was the point of all this — security and freedom for Israelis. And now this policy failed in the most horrible of ways.

Netanyahu failed. Ben-Gvir failed. There was a body count. And we’re being asked to trust that a government still led by Netanyahu will respond appropriately and wisely to not, under any circumstances, question the decisions they make.

Hamas and its backers in Iran want this war. They fear the normalization of Israel’s relations with the rest of the Middle East. The misery of the Gazans is and always has been their strength. If they are the only ones seen as trying to change a status quo that is unrelentingly hellish for those living inside it, then they stand alone as the champions of those who feel no hope.

We’ve spent decades testing the proposition of whether inflicting more punishment on the Palestinians will strengthen the moderates or the extremists in their midst. The answer is known. It is folly to forget it now.

There are two immovable facts here — the daily oppression that Palestinians live under and the daily threat that Israelis live amidst. And I’m not going to sit here and tell you that I know what Israel should do or how the deep structure of this conflict can be solved. I’m not among those who think there are some simple set of concessions or even at this point an imaginable deal that could or would lead to lasting peace. Not now.

There’s an old joke, though not very funny, about a tourist who asked for directions to Dublin, only to be told, well, if I were you, I wouldn’t start from here. But here is where we are. And we shouldn’t be fooled into believing that we cannot find ourselves somewhere much worse.

If you loathe Hamas, and you should loathe Hamas, you should assume that the place they’re trying to lead us is not where we should be trying to go. If you don’t think Netanyahu’s rule has made Israel safer, or more united, or closer to a resolution of the fundamental threats that face it — and it hasn’t — you should not yourself be cowed into trusting his instincts in this moment. That’s a lesson Americans learned, or should have learned, from 9/11, the one we have to pass on now.

Terrorists want you to act in a haze of fury and fear. The only antidote is to open yourself to criticism and second-guessing. If you don’t, you find yourself doing exactly what they wanted you to do. And you can do terrible damage to yourself and terrible damage to the world, damage they could have never inflicted on their own.

I was reading an essay by Arielle Angel, the editor-in-chief of the journal Jewish Currents, and she was reflecting on the story of the exodus from Egypt, the slaying of the firstborn children and adults and elderly. And she writes, quote, “It seems that hiding in our liberation myth is a recognition that violence will visit the oppressor society indiscriminately.” But there’s something else lurking in that story, too, something that has upset me since I first read it in Hebrew school as a child.

After some of the early plagues, the pharaoh agrees to let the Israelites go. But then he, quote, “hardens his heart and keeps them captive.” But later, as the plagues worsen, it is sometimes God who steps in and hardens the pharaoh’s heart after he agrees to let the Israelites go. After the plague of locusts it reads, quote, “The Lord hardened pharaoh’s heart and he would not let the Israelites go.” This happens repeatedly. After the darkness, “But the Lord hardened pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to let them go.”

I will not attempt any amateur theology here. There are many interpretations of these passages. I haven’t found one that really resolves the problem for me. But what I will say is that that story is also a parable of the relentless destructive escalation that comes when our hearts harden, when fury makes it impossible for us to find a way out. What could have ended with darkness, or locusts, or frogs, instead ends in mass death.

I have, for years, felt nothing but despair when I stare into the abyss of this conflict. There is no country in the world that would not hunt Hamas’s leaders to the ends of the Earth right now if their savagery had been visited upon them. And that is to say nothing of the hostages Hamas is still holding captive. But the idea that you’ll destroy Hamas this way, I doubt it, particularly if this becomes not just a generational trauma for ordinary Israelis, but also for Gazans, with thousands dead and who knows how many maimed and homeless and displaced.

When I was young, the first trip I ever took anywhere without my parents was to Israel. My grandparents took me. And they were so proud. They were the Holocaust generation. It was a defining fact of their lives. And Israel’s security, its existence meant everything to them because they felt it could one day mean everything for us. And I want for Israel what they wanted, what they saw in it — safety, a haven. And I want that for Palestinians, too.

And one thing I believe is that there is no chance of it until power is held by different forces on both sides. So that’s one question that’s going to animate the conversations I’m working on now, that we’ll release soon. How do those who want something different than this, something closer to peace, become strong enough to matter again?

The hardliners make each other stronger. Is it possible for the peacemakers to do the same?

Omer Balva, 22, was among the 360,000 reservists that the Israeli government had mobilized in an immense increase in its military forces ahead of an expected ground invasion of Gaza.

Mr. Balva was a staff sergeant in the 9203rd battalion of the Alexandroni Brigade, according to the Israel Defense Forces.

He moved to Israel after graduating from high school in Rockville, Md., in 2019 and was a student at Reichman University in Herzliya, Israel, where he was studying for a degree in business administration and economics.

Ethan Missner, a close friend of Mr. Balva’s since childhood, said that the two had talked “almost daily” for their entire lives, except when Mr. Balva was training with the Israeli military.

“Since we were 6 years old, I’ve spent, you know, endless time with him,” he said.

“I truthfully don’t know a single person that’s ever fought with Omer,” Mr. Missner added. “And I think that that’s a superpower Omer had, that he can know and be close to so many people and he was just only sweet.”

Mr. Balva was on vacation in the United States when he was called up to fight in Israel, Mr. Missner said. He said that Mr. Balva had been traveling with his girlfriend of four years, whom he had planned to propose to soon."
98,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/nyregion/israel-hamas-new-york-tensions.html,"Tensions were high in Muslim and Jewish communities around New York City, with impassioned protests and rallies on both sides in recent days drawing thousands as Israel girded for a ground invasion of Gaza.

On Saturday, about 5,000 people in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn, home to a significant Palestinian population, held a largely peaceful protest calling for Israel to stop killing civilians in Gaza. Near the end, 19 people were arrested, some of them after clashing with the police.

The protest followed a large pro-Israel demonstration near Times Square on Thursday and a pro-Palestinian demonstration on Friday at which 139 people were arrested while blocking traffic, according to the police.

“So many people in New York City have family back home, and they’re scared to death and they’re angry and afraid,” Justin Brannan, a city councilman for Bay Ridge, said on Sunday, adding, “I think it’s important that we acknowledge that justice for one group won’t come through the erasure of another.”

His opponent in an upcoming City Council race, Councilman Ari Kagan, noted that someone at the Bay Ridge rally carried a sign that included a drawing of a trash can with the Israeli flag inside. “Pure hate & a call for violence,” he wrote on X, formerly called Twitter.

There were at least four demonstrations on Sunday, the police said, in Midwood and Flatbush, Brooklyn; Jackson Heights, Queens; and near Central Park in Manhattan.

Antisemitic and anti-Islamic attacks have added to the unease and anxiety felt by New Yorkers. New York City is home to the largest population of Jews outside of Israel and to one of the country’s largest Muslim communities.

On Friday night, the police announced the arrest of two men who they said were part of a larger group that shouted anti-Muslim slurs while attacking three other men on Oct. 11. They were charged with assault, menacing and aggravated harassment, all as hate crimes."
99,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/nyregion/cooper-union-protest-israel-hamas.html,"The tensions inflamed by the Israel-Hamas war that have roiled university campuses in the United States spilled into the Cooper Union in New York on Wednesday, with pro-Palestinian protesters pounding on one side of locked library doors and Jewish students on the other.

The episode, captured in a six-second video snippet that was widely shared on social media, was among the latest examples of how sharply the Middle East conflict has divided student bodies at a number of top liberal arts colleges.

The Cooper Union, which is on the edge of Manhattan’s East Village neighborhood and which grants degrees in art, architecture and engineering, has fewer than 1,000 students.

In the video, a small group of students, several identifiable as Jews by their skullcaps, can be seen talking to one another inside the library while students outside bang on the doors and yell pro-Palestinian slogans.

The encounter followed a planned protest that began at about 1 p.m. outside the college, according to accounts provided by the police, a Cooper Union spokeswoman and a student who was in the library at the time.

About 70 students had been chanting pro-Palestinian slogans while about 20 pro-Israel students stood nearby watching silently in a counterprotest, John Chell, chief of patrol for the Police Department, said at a news conference on Thursday.

Police officers had come to the protest in plainclothes at the request of college officials, he said.

“Police were there from start to finish,” Chief Chell said, contradicting earlier reports that said officers had not responded immediately.

At about 3:30 p.m., roughly 20 of the students who had been chanting went into the building, but did not swipe through security, Chief Chell said.

The students walked upstairs through the building toward the president’s office, followed by the police, college officials and private security guards, he said.

Some of the Jewish students who had been counter-protesting had gone to the library on the lobby level, where other students were also present, according to the student who was there. The student spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concerns about safety on campus.

Chief Chell said at no point did the police or private security at the campus perceive any danger from any of the protesters.

“There was no direct threat. There was no damage,” he said. “And there was no danger to any students in that school.”

As the pro-Palestinian students came downstairs toward the lobby, a Cooper Union staff member decided to close the door to the library, Chief Chell said.

For about 10 minutes, the pro-Palestinian students banged on the door and on the windows of the library, then left, Chief Chell said. The student who was in the library described feeling scared that the protesters might break down the doors and said the banging had lasted longer than 10 minutes.

College officials and the police then asked the Jewish students in the library if they felt safe leaving on their own and offered to get them transportation home, but they declined, he said.

In a statement, the Cooper Union spokeswoman, Kim Newman, said the library had been “closed” for about 20 minutes while the protesters “moved through our building.”

“Some students who were previously in the library remained there during this time,” Ms. Newman said, adding that all students, including the protesters, had dispersed by 5:30 p.m.

There were no arrests or summonses as a result of the episode, the police said.

Chief Chell said there would be police officers on campus on Thursday.

“We’ll make sure that everything goes peaceful today,” he said."
100,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/world/middleeast/rishi-sunak-israel-visit-uk.html,"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain on Thursday began a two-day visit to Israel and the region to demonstrate British backing for the Israeli government, call for de-escalation of the conflict and press for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza.

Mr. Sunak met the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, during the trip, which followed a visit by President Biden on Wednesday. The British prime minister aims to build on the commitment that the U.S. said it had secured from Israel’s government to allow food, water and medicine into the Gaza Strip through Egypt.

In response to the brutal attacks and hostage-taking on Oct. 7 by members of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza, Israel has bombarded the impoverished enclave with airstrikes, sealed off the territory to imports of vital supplies, and told 1.1 million people in northern Gaza to evacuate south, as Israeli forces prepare for a ground invasion.

Gaza’s more than two million people are rapidly running out of water, food, fuel, electricity and medicine, hundreds of thousands are displaced, and many have no shelter."
101,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/us/politics/biden-israel.html,"Three days after Hamas terrorists slaughtered more than 1,400 people, President Biden offered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu support in the wake of the vow by Israel’s leader to “avenge this black day” and to turn Hamas hide-outs “into a ruin” from the air and on the ground.

“I told him if the United States experienced what Israel is experiencing, our response would be swift, decisive and overwhelming,” Mr. Biden recalled saying during a call between the two leaders on Oct. 10.

But the president’s message, in which he emphatically joined the mourning that was sweeping through Israel, has shifted dramatically over the past three weeks. While he continues to declare unambiguous support for Israel, Mr. Biden and his top military and diplomatic officials have become more critical of Israel’s response to the terrorist attacks and the unfolding humanitarian crisis.

The president and his senior aides still cling to the hope that the new war between Israel and Hamas might eventually give way to a resumption of talks about normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, and could even offer some leverage for a return to negotiations over a two-state solution in which Israel and Palestine exist side by side. Mr. Netanyahu has long resisted such a move.

“Though it may seem a little bit more illusory now, we still believe it’s the right thing to do for the region, for the world, certainly for the Palestinian people,” John F. Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said on Monday.

But in the short run, American officials have grown more strident in reminding the Israelis that even if Hamas terrorists are deliberately intermingling with civilians, operations must be tailored to avoid nonmilitary casualties. Last week, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said at the United Nations that “humanitarian pauses must be considered,” a move that Israel has rejected.

“While Israel has the right — indeed, the obligation — to defend itself, the way it does so matters,” Mr. Blinken said, adding that “it means food, water, medicine and other essential humanitarian assistance must be able to flow into Gaza and to the people who need them.”

On Sunday, just a day after Israeli military leaders said Hamas terrorists were using a hospital in Gaza as a command center, Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser, was more blunt. Mr. Sullivan said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that Hamas’s use of civilians as human shields “creates an added burden for the Israeli Defense Forces.”

He added, “This is something that we talk about with the Israelis on a daily basis.” He then noted that hospitals were not legitimate military targets just as Israel was warning that another major hospital in Gaza had to be emptied out before the next round of bombing.

Administration officials said the shift in tone and substance was the result of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed, provoking outrage in the United States and around the world."
102,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/world/middleeast/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-gaza.html,"In Lebanon, there is little appetite for war, as the country suffers through a crippling economic crisis. Regionally, if Hezbollah opened a second front, it could prompt the United States to come to Israel’s aid.

“All of Lebanon, including Hezbollah — we don’t want a war,” said Lebanon’s foreign minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, who is in regular contact with Hezbollah. “There is Western pressure on the Lebanese government to apply pressure on Hezbollah not to go to war. We have dialogued with Hezbollah and my impression is that they won’t start a war. But will Israel start a war? We need equal pressure on them, too.”

American officials have privately urged Israeli leaders not to launch a major strike on Hezbollah that could plunge the region into all-out bloodshed.

“We don’t seek an escalation in the north,” Ron Dermer, Israel’s minister of strategic affairs, said at a news conference on Monday. “Hezbollah may decide they’re going to escalate, and we’re going to have to respond and we’re prepared for that.”

“We hope they don’t make that mistake,” Mr. Dermer added. “They made a mistake, I think, in 2006. I think the leader of Hezbollah said if he knew what the response was going to be, he never would have started it. Believe me, the response now will make what happened in 2006 look like child’s play.”

But, Mr. Bou Habib said, if the carnage in Gaza worsens, or Israel escalates its attacks in Lebanon, Hezbollah may feel more pressure to respond.

“If the situation gets really bad in Gaza, it will be really bad for the whole region — not just Lebanon and Israel,” Mr. Bou Habib said.

Hezbollah, like Hamas, has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and other countries.

Some Hamas leaders have suggested that they expect more help from Hezbollah.

Khaled Meshaal, the political leader of Hamas until 2017, said that the group’s regional allies could contribute more to the war effort.

“When such a heinous crime is perpetrated against Gaza, greater things are certainly needed,” Mr. Meshaal said in a recent interview with Al Arabiya, a news channel. “But we should not single out Lebanon and Hezbollah.”

While Hezbollah’s precise capabilities remain unclear, it can clearly cause damage inside of Israel. The group is believed to have an arsenal of up to 150,000 rockets, as well as precision guided missiles capable of striking sensitive targets.

“Hezbollah today is in a position to inflict pain on Israel if they choose to enter this war,” said Maha Yahya, the director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut.

“The range of response Hezbollah can have is pretty versatile,” Ms. Yahya said. “They don’t need to do a ground incursion into Israel. With Iran, they could start using the Syrian front and there could be attacks outside of Israel, not necessarily inside Israel against Israeli interests. That has happened before.”

The Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has been unusually quiet since the Oct. 7 attacks that Hamas launched into Israel, killing some 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 230 civilians and soldiers hostage. Israel has responded with a vast bombing campaign on Gaza, a blockade on fuel and a ground invasion. Mr. Nasrallah is scheduled to address his followers on Friday, leaving the region on edge."
103,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/us/state-department-official-resigns-israel-arms.html,"A State Department official in the bureau that oversees arms transfers resigned this week in protest of the Biden administration’s decision to continue sending weapons and ammunition to Israel as it lays siege to Gaza in its war with Hamas.

In his resignation letter, Josh Paul, who has been the director of congressional and public affairs for the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs for over 11 years, said the Biden administration’s “blind support for one side” was leading to policy decisions that were “shortsighted, destructive, unjust and contradictory to the very values we publicly espouse.”

“The response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response and for the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people,” he wrote, adding, “I fear we are repeating the same mistakes we have made these past decades, and I decline to be a part of it for longer.”

In an interview, Mr. Paul said that Israel’s cutting off of water, food, medical care and electricity to the Gaza Strip, a region of two million people, should prompt protections in a number of longstanding federal laws intended to keep American weapons out of the hands of human rights violators. But those legal guardrails are failing, he said."
104,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/world/middleeast/israel-airstrike-gaza-jabaliya.html,"An airstrike that Israel said was targeting Hamas militants caused widespread damage in a densely populated neighborhood of Gaza on Tuesday. Hamas and hospital officials said numerous people were killed and wounded, as humanitarian organizations warned that the territory’s civilian population was at a breaking point.

The strike left the largest of Gaza’s eight refugee camps in chaos, and in its aftermath, distraught residents could be seen milling about the newly cratered terrain, which was strewn with shards of concrete. A photograph published by Reuters showed a Red Crescent ambulance on a street and more than 30 white sheets wrapped around what appeared to be bodies lying on the ground.

Hamas, the armed group that controls Gaza, and local doctors said hundreds of people had been wounded or killed at the Jabaliya refugee camp. Independent verification of the claim was not possible, but Israel itself described the strike as a “wide-scale” attack.

A nearby hospital was quickly overrun with patients. Dr. Marwan Sultan, medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, said many were women and children, and that dozens of others had been killed.

“We are receiving civilians,” Dr. Sultan said. “They should stop this war, this attack against civilians living in their homes. This is simply genocide, what’s happening now.”

The Israeli military said that its fighter jets had been targeting Hamas militants, among them Ibrahim Biari, a commander it described as a central figure behind the Hamas-led massacres that killed more than 1,400 people in Israel on Oct, 7. He and “a large number of terrorists who were with Biari were killed,” it said. The military claimed that an “underground terror infrastructure” — Hamas has built and extensive network of tunnels under the territory — had collapsed.

A Hamas spokesman denied that a Hamas commander had been in the area."
105,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/world/middleeast/macron-israel-hamas-war.html,"President Emmanuel Macron of France expressed firm support for Israel during a trip there on Tuesday, even as he insisted that its war against Hamas should spare civilians and that Israel should not lose sight of a political resolution to the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

“You are not alone,” Mr. Macron told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at a news conference, after a closed-door meeting between the two leaders.

“The fight must be without mercy,” Mr. Macron added, “but not without rules, because we are democracies that are fighting against terrorists, democracies that respect the laws of war, democracies that do not target civilians, in Gaza or elsewhere.”

Mr. Netanyahu thanked Mr. Macron for his visit, but he focused on military operations against Hamas, which he said “must be destroyed.”"

Hey, boys and girls. Nice to see you all.

You as well. How’s the other coast?

Yeah, it’s a lot better. Ariel Sharon once said, when he became prime minister, there are things I can see from here that I couldn’t see from there. And that’s how I feel.

ross douthat

And this is “Matter of Opinion.” [MUSIC PLAYING] This will be our second consecutive episode talking about the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, the possibly looming Israeli invasion of Gaza. Joe Biden visited Israel this week. Thousands have been killed. Around a million people have been displaced within Gaza. And so to push that conversation a little bit beyond our own shared expertise — awesome as it is — we’re going to do something slightly different. Carlos is not with us this week. And in his place, we’ve asked a colleague who knows this region very well — indeed he spent his entire career covering it — to join us. And that, of course, is Tom Friedman, who’s been bureau chief for The Times in Beirut and Jerusalem, the paper’s diplomatic and White House correspondent, and he’s covered foreign affairs in his opinion column for nearly 30 years with several Pulitzer prizes to go along with all of that expertise. And I’d just say, among people who ply our particular trade, he is the columnist who, when you imagine columnists on the phone with world leaders at a moment of crisis, you imagine Tom Friedman, because, in fact, he is. So with all of that said, Tom, thank you so much for joining us.

thomas friedman

Real pleasure, Ross. Thank you.

ross douthat

So we’re going to try and start by doing some historical context, talking about the big picture, and then get into the realities on the ground right now and what’s likely to happen. So can we step back for a moment and just try and contextualize the landscape for us? It’s been 18 years since Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip. It’s been 16 years, I think, since Hamas took power. And obviously there have been plenty of conflicts between Israel and Hamas in that time. How is this situation different and potentially transformative, do you think?

Well, I think, first of all, is the context, and I think the context is very relevant here. This Hamas attack on Israel comes at a time almost one could say, Ross, on the eve of a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. And while it was not done, there was a lot of optimism in the administration and in the region that it would get done. This would have opened the way for Israel to much wider acceptance throughout the Muslim world, Muslim countries that haven’t yet normalized, particularly big ones like Indonesia and Malaysia. So for Hamas and for Iran, Hamas’s backer, this was a strategic threat. They had to do something that would trigger as violent and as crazy a response as they could from Israel, that would create as many Palestinian casualties as they could, that would then freeze the Saudis and the Arab — all the other Arab countries — those who have already normalized and those who might be considering it from going ahead. And I think that, to the best we can figure out the timing, that was it. And so far, it’s been working pretty peachy for Hamas and Iran.

lydia polgreen

This was a conflict that was really frozen for a long time. And as you say, this seems to have jumpstarted it. One of the things that I’ve been thinking about is the distance between the autocratic governments that have normalized relationships with Israel and the sentiment of the populations of those countries. How do those dynamics play into this moment right now, because I would imagine that leaders of a lot of these countries, who are generally not democratically elected, are pretty nervous about what’s happening on their streets.

thomas friedman

Lydia, it’s a real good point. The most nervous, of course, is Jordan, which 50 percent of its population are Palestinians. And pictures of Palestinian civilians being killed in Gaza, whatever the circumstances, just inflame the streets. These regimes are very fragile — all of them. They are — none of them are legitimate in the sense of being elected. And so times of stress like this particularly hits Jordan in ways that are really problematic and dangerous for the regime. But everyone is bracing themselves for when the actual fighting starts. Israel appears to be dedicated to moving into Gaza to kill and capture the Hamas leadership. And that is going to provide incendiary video. I don’t think we’ve ever seen a conflict like this. I think this will be the front end of something that has all these Arab regimes deeply frightened.

ross douthat

So if this all seems sort of predictable as a strategic consequence of Hamas doing this, why wasn’t Israel better prepared? Was it simply internal divisions within Israel distracting attention? Because I mean, one of the arguments I’ve seen in the last week or two is that there was just a misunderstanding of Hamas. That there was an assumption by Israelis, by Americans, that while Hamas was obviously still a fanatical terrorist organization, it also liked governing Gaza in a fairly normal way. And obviously we can see that that was not, in fact, the case. But what do you think the Israeli thinking was that made this, again, seemingly predictable demonstration of Hamas’s power to disrupt everything sort of possible?

thomas friedman

You know, Ross, that these things are never one thing. It’s usually an accumulation of things and misperceptions and just ways of thinking that take hold. So let’s start at 30,000 feet. From 30,000 feet, Prime Minister Netanyahu really had a very intentional policy of strengthening Hamas and weakening the Palestinian Authority. So strengthening the Palestinian group that would never recognize Israel while weakening the one that would. He did this both so they would remain separate, so there could never be a unified Palestinian decision, and so he could go to the Americans and say, what do you want me to do? I got crazy Hamas to my left, and I have the feckless incompetent Palestinian Authority to my right. But that was Netanyahu’s cynicism. Now, part of that cynicism ended up converging with the Qatari interests. Qatar is a small Persian Gulf state, and the Qataris like to project their power. And they’re also very sympathetic to Muslim Brotherhood movements in the region, and Hamas is one of those. And so the Qataris stepped in with the Israelis’ encouragement and said we’ll provide civilian aid, basically — food, books, hospital equipment — over $1 billion now over the last decade to support Hamas so they will do really, Ross, what you said — be a proper governing authority and help the civilians there. And —

ross douthat

Tom, can I just pause you and ask, is that — when you say that Netanyahu specifically was trying to strengthen Hamas, is that the sort of Qatari gambit, if you will, is that the primary way he did that? What do we mean when we say Netanyahu was trying to build up Hamas?

thomas friedman

Let’s just say he didn’t want them to go away, and he understood he’d have to fight a war with them. I think four times over the last few years where they would fire off their rockets and Israel would bombard them. And it would always end in a ceasefire. And this became just kind of almost routine. And as part of that routine, to get back to your core question, Israel came to believe that these guys, at the end of the day, were rational actors who would never throw the dice on everything and enjoyed governing Gaza and doling out the patronage provided by the Qataris more than actually going on a gamble-it-all, almost suicide mission to kill and take hostage as many Israeli civilians as they could across the border. So it was really all of — that was the biggest, I think, miscalculation. I talked to Israeli security people in the last 48 hours, and one of them said to me straight out, Ross, we didn’t understand that Hamas became ISIS. And I think there was a lot of things they didn’t understand. But one was that it had become much more radicalized, but also that it was not a status quo power as it were. It remained a revolutionary Islamic power. And they misread that. It comes in a context, though, also, Ross, of, if you think about it, Israel had five elections you recall, I think in the last, you know, six years. In not a single one of those elections was the Palestinian question, the future of the territories and a peace process, part of those elections. It’s quite remarkable. And I made this point once to Israeli military people. I said, you were so good at anticipating, preventing and muffling Palestinian attacks on Israel through cyber means and other means, that they lost the signal in the noise. They managed to suppress through military and intelligence means what was actually percolating below so effectively that basically Israelis were in a kind of trance that this was all manageable indefinitely. We don’t need a peace process. And not only that, we can actually afford to elect the most radical Jewish supremacist government in the history of the country.

michelle cottle

So this brings up something we were talking to some folks from the Israel Policy Forum this week. And they were saying that this is evidence that you can’t really decouple the normalization process from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And they think this is kind of a signal that that just isn’t really a viable option. I mean, is that your thinking on this?

thomas friedman

Yeah, well, and this is what I’ve said all along. Netanyahu is always back at M.I.T. trying to win the debate against the Arab Student Union when he was a student there. And his life mission was to prove that he could have normalization with the Arab world without anything for the Palestinians, that he could have his normalization cake and eat the Palestinians as well. And my response to him was, you’re like a man who tells me that he’s adding muscle everywhere but still has stomach cancer.

michelle cottle

So do you think this is the end of him as far as his reign goes?

thomas friedman

I never would predict that kind of thing, Michelle. For the sake of Israel and the Jewish people, I sure hope it is. Everything he stood for is wrong, turned out, and was a big part of — again, let’s go back to the pre — what was going on in Israel before this happened. Netanyahu was engaged in a political flight of fancy to, in effect, neuter the Israeli Supreme Court for two reasons — for the benefit of the settler movement, which wanted the Supreme Court out of the way because it was the one body standing in the way of their seizing Palestinian lands illegally, and his ultra-orthodox partners who understood and knew that the court was the one thing that was standing in their way of being relieved, formally, legally, by Israeli law from their sons having to serve in the Israeli army. Basically, Netanyahu wanted the court out of the way to dismantle Oslo and to dismantle its ability to impose its will on the ultra-orthodox.

michelle cottle

Well there certainly seems to be a lot of rage within Israel about this toward the government. I mean, is it pretty widespread? I mean, what is your sense of how much of an impact that will wind up having?

thomas friedman

Well, you know, Michelle, they had a very revealing incident two weeks ago when Idit Silman, who is the Minister of Environment in Israel in Netanyahu’s coalition. She’s very important because she was the minister who defected from the last coalition, basically to give Netanyahu a majority to make this government. She came to a hospital to visit wounded, early in this war, and basically was driven out by the doctors and nurses, who said, you divided us, now you want to drag us into another war? By the way, everyone now — the head of the Shin Bet, the chief of military intelligence, and the commander in chief of the army have all come out and said, I failed, and I take responsibility. There’s only one person who hasn’t, and that’s the prime minister.

lydia polgreen

Yeah, can I ask about the political contours? I mean, one thing that’s really notable is the way in which Israel’s politics have just really decisively moved to the right for a country that had a long history of a very powerful Labor Party. And it really is a country where the center right is essentially the center at this point and everything is sort of right from there. Do you see that overall political calculus changing as a result of these events?

thomas friedman

I can tell you the column I will be writing next, which is that President Biden said in Israel that he’s going to offer an unprecedented financial aid package to Israel. And I’ll support that package under one condition: that Israel agrees that it will not build a single more settlement anywhere beyond the settlement blocks. Not one brick, not one nail, not one ounce of cement. Because I will be damned if my tax dollars are going to be used to relieve Bibi Netanyahu’s political problems, that he needs the settlers for his coalition, and so he’s going to take this money and use it for that. Of course, he’ll say this is all aid. Money’s all fungible. If Netanyahu wants to fight a war with Hamas and build settlements, then he needs to pass a 50 percent tax hike at home. And Israelis need to decide that and know that and pay for it. But I —— will not do that. And I’m going to use my every ounce of energy I have to make sure, because it’s a very simple calculation. Israel cannot get out of Gaza unless there is a legitimate Palestinian Authority. And the only way there’s going to be a legitimate Palestinian Authority is if we go back and revive the two state solution.

ross douthat

One more question, Tom, before we jump more fully into the future and what is likely to actually happen. We’ve been talking about what Israel’s thinking or lack of thinking was, what Hamas is thinking. What is the Iranian perspective? Obviously it’s very similar to Hamas’s perspective. But Iran has not pulled out all the stops attacking Israel. Hezbollah is not, at the moment, opening a second front in the north. Just give us your sense of what the Iranians are thinking right now.

thomas friedman

So Ross, the first thing I always keep in mind when I’m think about the Iranian thinking is that there is no Iranian thinking. It’s a government of coalitions with multiple power centers. But the way I look at it, Ross, is America now has two carrier battle groups off the coast of Israel and Lebanon. And Iran has its version of aircraft carriers. They’re called Hamas network, Hezbollah network in Lebanon, Hezbollah network in Syria, Hezbollah network in Iraq, and Hezbollah network in Yemen. So that’s how it projects its power. And Iran, basically, is occupying four Arab capitals right now — Baghdad, Beirut, Damascus, and Sana’a. And it does this both for defensive means, as a way to protect itself from others projecting power against it, particularly Israel and America, and does it for offensive means, to condition the region. Unfortunately, for the region, the way Iran projects its power through these networks is that it creates failed Arab states. So Lebanon has not been able to elect a president for I don’t know how long now — I think it’s approaching a year — because Iran doesn’t like the candidate. And so failed state in Lebanon, failed state in Syria, not failed state but fragile state in Iraq, failed state in Yemen. That’s how it projects its power. And ultimately, it’s made very clear it wants to eradicate Israel because it sees Israel as the biggest regional threat to itself, the country that can project power the other way, which is why all these Arab countries have cozied up to it. It wasn’t that they discovered Zionism suddenly. And so this is a real standoff now between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Israel. And they’re very much in the picture, and they’re smart and they’re tough.

ross douthat

All right, on that note, we’re going to take a break. And when we come back, we’re going to go further into the future and talk about what Israel is likely to do in the next few days or the next few weeks. So stay with us. [MUSIC PLAYING] And we’re back and trying to look ahead at Israeli strategy and what’s likely to happen next. And Michelle, I think you were ready with a question on that front as we went to break.

michelle cottle

So Tom, in a column this week, you made the case that Israel should not invade Gaza. But what are the other viable options that you see at this point?

thomas friedman

You know, Michelle, I wrote that column just sort of from the gut. And everyone asked me that question afterwards, including the President of the United States. And my answer was, I don’t know. All I know is this really scares me. Let’s just look what happened this week. A hospital in Gaza was — exploded, basically. You think about it for a second, Michelle, Islamic Jihad may have achieved its greatest P.R. victory in this war by blowing up its own hospital — inadvertently, by the way. By all evidence, they launched a part of a missile barrage toward Israel, and as often happens, one of their rockets failed and landed in the parking lot of this hospital. It immediately went around the world. Headlines everywhere — Israel attacks hospital — including in a newspaper that we know very well. And by the time the truth had a chance to put its shoes on, this inflamed the entire Arab world. Now, fast-forward and imagine that, Michelle, every day, every hour — pictures of that.

michelle cottle

Yeah.

thomas friedman

Because we’re talking about an urban war in a world of social networks, artificial intelligence, fake news. And that’s really what worries me. And so my own — I don’t want to — I’m reluctant to talk about how I would fight this war because it’s Israel’s war and I look at it from America’s interest. But if I were standing back, I would be, first of all, calling this war Operation Rescue Our Children. Hamas has over 200 hostages. And secondly, I would be doing it in a very targeted way that hearkens back to the 2006 Israeli war against Hezbollah in Beirut, which was a very important conflict because what Israel did in that war was, eventually, the Air Force bombed the homes of all the officials in the southern suburbs of Beirut, and then afterwards Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, gave an interview saying, had I known then what — had I known when I started this war what I know now I never would have started it. Because one of my rules about Middle East politics is all important politics in the Middle East happens what they say in Arabic [ARABIC]: “the morning after the morning after.” So the morning after the 2006 war, Hezbollah came out and said, look at us, [ARABIC], we won, we defeated them. Everyone heard that conversation. The conversation you didn’t hear was, you know, Ahmed Hussein pulling Hassan Nasrallah aside and saying, what were you thinking? What were you thinking? My house is on the ground here. My car is under the rubble. What were you thinking? Now, I guarantee you that conversation is going on in what I would call Hamas-occupied Gaza right now. And so Israel is in an impossible predicament. And I get that. It’s in a morally impossible situation. It feels it needs to restore its credibility, to show, as I wrote the other day, that it cannot be outcrazied by Hamas. But to do it now in a wired world where everyone will see everything, and where it’ll all bounce around and get amplified. So basically, what President Biden did is he gave Israel a green light when he went to Israel. He’s given Israel a green light to fight the perfect war. The war that will go just so deep, just so long, kill just so few civilians and end up with Israel getting out just in time.

michelle cottle

So you think he threaded that needle?

thomas friedman

Oh, I think he’s threaded it intellectually. It’s actually delivering the perfect war in the real world where the challenge is going to come. So Israel’s got permission for the perfect war from Biden. But to actually deliver it against an enemy that will go out of its way to highlight every civilian casualty, every error — and errors always happen in wars — it just worries me a lot. This Netanyahu government, we just have to say one thing — I’ve followed Israeli politics, I mean, since I was 10 years old. Other than the defense minister, I do not know a single member of Netanyahu’s cabinet. And if I may be immodest, I know everyone in Israeli politics. [LAUGHTER] I don’t know a single person in his cabinet. This cabinet is so incompetent, I would not let them be waiters at my grandson’s bar mitzvah, let alone run this kind of complex war. That’s why Netanyahu had to form a National Unity government, bring in Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, two former chiefs of staff, to counterbalance the lunatics that he brought in earlier for a different project. And let us remember, with all due modesty, Israel has not won a war against Arabs, Arab countries, Arab foes, since 1967. Keep that in mind. My attitude is, until I see a solid government with a fixed plan, with a plan for the morning after vis-a-vis the peace process, I’d just wait.

michelle cottle

Ross, you look like you have a very troubled question to ask. [LAUGHS]

ross douthat

No, I just — taking all of those points, I just don’t see how, under democratic conditions where the government of Israel is answerable to the people of Israel, who, for the reasons you suggest, shouldn’t show particular deference to this government, it’s essentially impossible for me to see how an Israeli government of any sort can play the long game as you describe, right? Because, yes, say it conducts a purely surgical war in which some hostages are rescued, a bunch of Hamas officials are killed, and say that the Hamas officials who survive do wake up the morning after the morning after and say, man, probably we shouldn’t have done that because my brother’s dead, my cousin is dead, my house is destroyed, my car is buried. Say all of that happens. From the Israeli perspective in that landscape, Hamas is still in power in Gaza. Hamas’s capacities are reduced but not at all destroyed, their capacities to do the thing that they just did — this extraordinarily traumatic murderous attack beyond anything we’ve seen for a long time. And in that scenario, even if Hamas’s leadership provisionally regrets it, we were just saying we should assume that Hamas is now more ISIS-like, right? So yeah, maybe they have some temporary regrets. But a year or two goes by, they see another opportunity to conduct another massacre. Why would the Israeli public not assume that they would do it again, unless they are actually removed from power, which seems to me to be the sort of inescapable imperative of Israeli politics even with all the risks that you describe.

thomas friedman

So one of the bad jokes I used to say to friends in the Israeli military when I was the Times correspondent there is Israel was always announcing that it had assassinated the number two man in Hamas. [LAUGHTER] If I had a dime for every time Israel assassinated the number two man in Hamas, I’d be a rich man today. By the way, Ross, it’s very interesting, if you check Google, two months ago, I think, or two and a half months ago, Israel assassinated the number one and two leaders of Islamic Jihad. And so I’m just kind of — I’m just so wary of the four most dangerous words I ever heard, in the Middle East, are once and for all. It’s just like trying to do something there once and for all in the broken landscape there is just really difficult. Israel faces hellish choices. And I’m not trying to say — I’m not smarter than anybody here. I’m just saying if I have to flip a coin, my coin says, wait, do it as surgically as possible, frame it globally as an effort to recover my hostages, which I think everyone in the world can understand. Because there’s two groups of Palestinians out there and always have been. There are Palestinians who are ready to live with Israel as a Jewish state. They signed the Oslo treaty. I know them well. They are there and they’re real. And there are Palestinians who are dedicated to wiping that Jewish state off the map. And what happens in our debates, Ross, is that people tend to want to downplay one and emphasize the other. So you have Israel supporters who — “they all want to destroy us, that’s all they want to do.” And you have Palestinian supporters who say, “Look, it’s all about the occupation.” And the fact is it’s complicated. There are both. To think about Israel, I think, today, you have to hold three thoughts in your head at the same time. One is that Israel is an amazing place. What Israel has built in 100 years, in a deeply hostile environment, from science to medicine, to literature, to the ingathering of exiles, and medicine, it’s just amazing, number one. Number two, Israel does bad stuff. Israel does bad stuff sometimes. It steals Palestinian land. It lets settlers occupy land illegally and then legalizes them. Israel does bad stuff. And third, Israel lives in a crazy dangerous neighborhood. Their neighbors are not Canada and Mexico. Now, I have no problem holding all three of those thoughts in my head at the same time. Unfortunately, most people can’t. And so I’m always just looking in my own mind not for a knockout blow — there just aren’t any. I’m looking for the least bad that buys the most time. That’s my whole philosophy of life. Israel, do the least bad that buys the most time because there is no once and for all.

lydia polgreen

Yeah, I mean, it’s interesting, I’ve been spending a lot of time, as I imagine a lot of my colleagues have, reading the English-language Israeli press where you see a much wider range of criticisms of the Israeli government, of the occupation than you see in the mainstream U.S. press, I think, which is fascinating. But I’d be curious to hear you talk about what are the opportunities for the Palestinian cause just more broadly in this moment. Clearly what has been happening has not been working. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which is pro-liberation for Palestine, has essentially been painted as the equivalent of anti-Semitism. There’s been a very, very fierce push to make it so that the nonviolent resistance to the Palestinian — there’s been a lot of criticism of that. But at the same time, crisis creates opportunity, right? We’re in a moment right now where there perhaps will be possibilities for those, as you say, who want to live in peace with Israel and want to see a Palestinian self-governing state in the region.

thomas friedman

What I’d say is, first of all, again, one of my own personal watchwords is, I love Israelis and Palestinians, but God save me from their American friends. So I do not engage with either side because I’m just not interested in the info wars around this thing. I’m interested not to make a point but how to make a difference. And to that point — and it really relates to your second question — with wise leadership, if the United States would now tell Netanyahu what we should have told him many years ago — not one nail, not one brick, not one ounce of cement is going to go into another settlement outside the settlement blocks that will basically prevent a two-state solution. So we’re going to have that argument right now because you have no way of getting out of Gaza, and we have no way of supporting you in the perfect war without some hope for a two-state solution. That has to go with another bit of honesty toward Palestinians and Palestinian supporters. The Palestinian Authority is a corrupt, ineffective organization. Guess what, folks, Palestinians have agency, too. Enough of they’re occupied. There’s nothing we could do. No, they actually have agency. And the reason we know that is they had a prime minister named Salam Fayyad. I even coined a term. I called it “Fayyadism.” Because Salam Fayyad said we’re going to build institutions. We’re going to do this just the way the Yehudis did it. We’re going to build one institution after another, root out corruption, create jobs and opportunities. And at the end, a state will have to be given to us. And you know what happened to Salam Fayyad? Salam Fayyad got pushed out by Abu Mazen, because he was jealous of him, and he didn’t want him around, and he was a little too non-corrupt. Where was B.D.S. when that happened? Where were all the Palestinian supporters on the occupation when the Palestinian leadership pushed out the most effective, meaningful, important leader they ever had? And so if I carry around a lot of anger at all these people it’s because I do, because they don’t know anything about the history of the conflict. So I’ve had my fill of the B.D.S. people and all these people — all of them, OK? And none of them want to face up to the things they did wrong, the things they ignored. And this goes to both sides. None of them have the real interests of the people at heart and none of them are truth tellers. Have I gotten myself in enough trouble yet? [MICHELLE LAUGHS]

ross douthat

I just wanted to ask — because you mentioned earlier that you’re obviously trying to think about this from the American perspective, not just the Israeli or Palestinian perspective, right?

thomas friedman

Yeah.

ross douthat

And that’s — I mean, as are we all, I think. And so my question for you is, what’s the point of maximal danger for the U.S. here in terms of those carrier groups that we have in the Mediterranean becoming involved in some way in terms of an actual regional war breaking out? What are you looking at beyond just images and info wars, what scares you the most about the next few months on that front?

thomas friedman

So Ross, there was a moment, a week ago I believe, where a Israeli radar picked up a massive drone attack from Lebanon. And it was —

ross douthat

Yes, we were recording this podcast — — believe it or not, while that showed up on Twitter.

thomas friedman

Your colleague was sitting at his computer writing a different column —

ross douthat

Yes.

thomas friedman

— and saw that. And I said, I’ve got a whole new problem — column to write. Because if Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah start to go after it with missiles, this is a call your broker moment. This is not a normal thing. Because that could very easily bring America in. And once we’re in, and Putin and Xi are just licking their chops because it completely screws Zelensky in Ukraine. And the Iranians are sitting back there in Tehran. Israel has German submarines in the Persian Gulf right now. And I’m terrified that we are closer to that than people realize.

michelle cottle

Well, now I’m terrified, too, Tom. Thank you.

thomas friedman

I’m really sorry.

ross douthat

But then just what prevents that? Because if that’s in Iran’s interest, and it’s in Russia’s interest, and it’s in China’s interest, is it just that it’s not in Hezbollah’s interest that prevents it? What prevents that from happening?

thomas friedman

So what prevents it — it is, at the end of the day, the last time Iran basically curtailed its nuclear program was when America invaded Iraq, and they thought they were next. So this is a regime that does know how to calculate its interests. If Iran really thinks that it is in danger, it’s possible that they will pull back. That’s why if you ask me, I think it’s still a very 50/50 proposition. I will be more surprised than not, Ross, if they get into this war because they have always used Hezbollah as their second strike. If we think of it in conventional nuclear balance of power terms, Hezbollah’s precision rockets were Iran’s second strike capability against Israel. The idea that they would sacrifice those for Hamas and this war and possibly invite a strategic Israeli and American response against them, it strikes me as quite hard to believe. But at this stage, I’ll believe anything. And we live in a world now where the American president hasn’t talked to the president of China for probably weeks or months. And we’ve got a war in Europe with Ukraine that Putin is just full of revenge for finding a way to enmesh America in another war that will also burn up weaponry that would go to Ukraine. So we’re sitting on a really dangerous moment. I just have a new granddaughter, born two weeks ago. All I’m thinking about is this world that she’s entering into and always remembering just a cardinal rule for me in the Middle East — perfect is not on the menu. Once and for all is not on the menu.

michelle cottle

So, well, on that note, Tom, I think probably we have stolen enough of your time. Thank you so much for coming. Even if this was slightly terrifying for me, it’s extremely useful.

lydia polgreen

Congratulations on the new grandchild.

thomas friedman

I appreciate it very much. It’s a pleasure to be with my great colleagues. And thank you, Ross, Lydia, Michelle, thank you so much. And I should have warned you I can ruin any dinner party and I do weddings and bar mitzvahs.

michelle cottle

Oh, excellent. We’ll be — my people will be in touch.

ross douthat

Thank you so much, Tom. And when we come back, it will be just your three hosts and we’ll be doing hot and cold. [MUSIC PLAYING] We’re back. And to round out the episode, we’re going to do our weekly hot-cold. And which of my co-hosts has something?

michelle cottle

Oh, I have one. I am hot on horror movie season. Now, you can judge if you must, but for my household, we start in October as Halloween approaches. And I basically bully members of my family into watching any kind of horror movie you want to talk about within reason. So last night, my house, it was the original “Omen.” And coming up next, “The Exorcist.” And I view this as a way to escape the kind of real-life monsters and just have a little bit of fun that I don’t have to worry about. There’s a lot of nostalgia. I’m a child of the ‘70s. We grew up with the “Halloween” movies and the “Friday the 13th” movies that came along. That said, we don’t really do a lot of gore and slasher movies. So it needs to be more along the lines of “Nosferatu” or “Night of the Living Dead,” than your kind of “Saw” movies.

ross douthat

“It’s all for you, Damien.”

[laughing]

“It’s all for you.”

michelle cottle

Having grown up religious, I get particularly creeped out by anything having to do with demonic possession or satanic rituals. So that’s what really freaks me out.

lydia polgreen

Wow. My comfort season is I’m just glad that “Great British Bake-Off” is back. I had a slightly traumatic experience seeing the film “Angel Heart” at too young of an age, both for its scary demonic stuff and also there was like way too much sex for me when I was a kid, obviously, to see. [LAUGHTER] And so I really can’t watch scary movies at all. How about you, Ross?

ross douthat

Yeah, I mean, I always feel like I should really like scary horror movies because it is a very reactionary genre. [LAUGHTER] And I appreciate messages like Satan — like Satan is real and misbehaving teenagers will be punished for their sins, those kind of messages. But I have a sort of — I have sensitivities. And when I do watch horror, I will literally sit in a movie theater when I have to review a horror movie and sit there with my ears covered just to avoid the jump scare. The lesson of most horror movies, though, is don’t go seeking the devil out, right? That, I think, is the good baseline message of a lot of possession and exorcism movies. Don’t try and get your wife pregnant by the Prince of Darkness. Good, positive, family-friendly message from “Rosemary’s Baby,” right?

lydia polgreen

That’s a notion we can all get around.

michelle cottle

Yes.

ross douthat

And on that note, it’s not quite Halloween, but happy late October. Thanks for joining us. And we’ll be back next week.

lydia polgreen

See you next time.

michelle cottle

Bye, guys.

ross douthat"

He was shot in the left leg, he said, during a gunfight with two Hamas fighters who ambushed him as he searched for survivors at a music festival that was attacked.

“You’re strong and the people who you saved may never know who you are, but I will know you saved people at their greatest time of desperation,” Ms. Hochul told him, holding his hands.

The governor also met with four families of American citizens who had been taken hostage by Hamas. The meeting, at her Jerusalem hotel, was closed to the press, but at least one of Ms. Hochul’s aides left the room in tears.

Among the relatives she met with was Ruby Chen, a New Yorker whose son Itay Chen, a 19-year-old Israeli soldier, was officially declared a hostage on Wednesday. Mr. Chen said his son, who was stationed near the Gaza border, sent him a text message on the day of the attacks saying his base was being fired at. That was the last he heard from him.

“You wake up in the morning and you think it’s a nightmare,” Mr. Chen said in an interview after the meeting. “You have this black hole in your soul and you think, ‘This is hell.’”"
108,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/world/middleeast/israel-evacuations-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza.html,"The Israeli authorities said on Sunday that they would evacuate 14 more Israeli villages near the northern border with Lebanon amid escalating tit-for-tat clashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia, that have raised concerns that the Israel-Hamas war could ignite other regional confrontations.

Overall, more than 152,000 Israeli residents of cities, towns and villages near the borders of Gaza in the south and Lebanon in the north have evacuated their homes for safer parts of the country over the past two weeks, according to local Israeli authorities.

Haim Bibas, the chairman of the Federation of Local Authorities in Israel, who provided the figure, said it was likely to be the largest internal population displacement in the country’s 75-year history.

The scale of the displacement in Israel does not compare with that in Gaza, where an estimated 700,000 Palestinians in the northern half of the crowded coastal territory are believed to have heeded warnings from the Israeli military to move south amid an ongoing aerial bombardment. The United Nations said on Sunday that 1.4 million residents of Gaza were internally displaced overall. The total population of Gaza is more than two million people, while Israel’s population is over nine million.

The Israeli military said that over the past 24 hours, it had eliminated several squads of fighters trying to close in on Israeli positions and communities along the border with Lebanon and that Israel had attacked Hezbollah assets, observation points and military compounds across the border, including one from which a ground-to-air missile was fired at an Israeli drone. The claims had not been independently verified.

The pace of attacks appeared to be intensifying. On Sunday the Israeli military said it had fired back toward Lebanese territory after fighters launched anti-tank missiles against Israeli targets in three locations and said its aerial defense system had intercepted a drone approaching Israel from Lebanon.

“We will keep responding to every attack,” said Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman. “Hezbollah should not come into this,” he added, echoing messages conveyed by the American and Israeli leaderships that the Lebanese organization would do best to stay out of the fray.

Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, spoke with Najib Mikati, Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, on Friday to “affirm U.S. support for the Lebanese people” and note “growing concern over rising tensions along Lebanon’s southern border,” the State Department said in a statement.

Mr. Blinken “reiterated the importance of respecting the interests of the Lebanese people, who would be affected by Lebanon being drawn into the conflict instigated by Hamas’ terrorist attack on Israel.”

Israelis who survived the deadly Oct. 7 assault by Hamas, the armed group that controls Gaza, on the villages closest to the border with the coastal enclave were evacuated by the authorities in the immediate aftermath of the incursion that left more than 1,400 people dead, most of them civilians. That area of southern Israel is now considered a closed military zone as Israeli troops mass along the border with Gaza in anticipation of an expected ground invasion of the territory.

A week ago, the Israeli authorities began a state-funded evacuation of the nearby city of Sderot. Out of a population of about 30,000, only a few hundred families chose to remain in their homes. On Friday Israel set in motion the evacuation of Kiryat Shmona, its northernmost city with a population of more than 20,000. On the recommendation of local authority heads, villages and towns within two kilometers of the northern border had already mostly emptied out in the days after the Hamas incursion.

Moshe Davidovich, the head of the Mateh Asher regional council in the far north, said about 50,000 residents had already left the north by Sunday morning and only emergency and security teams remained in the villages along the border. The plan announced on Sunday for the additional 14 villages expands the evacuation zone from two kilometers to three kilometers, or 1.9 miles, from the border.

Military officials said Sunday that the voluntary evacuations protected civilian lives and gave the army more freedom in the area.

Israel’s Ministry of Defense said about 120,000 Israelis participating in the government-sponsored plan were now staying in one of the 234 guesthouses and hotels across the country. Local authority officials said that hotel rooms were still available but that they were also beginning to prepare schools and other public facilities to accommodate evacuees in case of need."
109,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/business/israel-oil-embargo-markets.html,"The prospect of an oil embargo arising from the conflict between Israel and militant groups contributed to a sharp but brief jolt in oil prices on Wednesday.

Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, called for Islamic countries to boycott Israel, including stopping oil shipments, according to Iranian media. He was speaking at a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Although Israel imports nearly all its oil, analysts said such an embargo would probably have little immediate impact, because the country does not buy oil from major Persian Gulf producers like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates or Iran.

Instead, Kazakhstan, where oil is mostly produced by joint ventures involving Western companies including Chevron and Exxon Mobil, and Azerbaijan are among Israel’s biggest suppliers. Nigeria is also a substantial supplier."
110,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-gaza-hamas.html,"Mr. Netanyahu called the Hamas video “cruel psychological warfare.”

Hamas is prepared for a long, bloody fight, and its fighters have turned Gaza into a labyrinth of tunnels, stocked with weapons and food. Some of the hostages are hidden in the tunnels, many of which are likely booby-trapped.

After pounding Gaza and its people with artillery and bombs, the Israeli army moved in on Friday. So far, the Israeli military has advanced to the outskirts of Gaza City but not entered the Hamas stronghold. Fierce urban fighting is expected when they do.

Rob Saale, the former head of the F.B.I.-led Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, said Israel was facing an unprecedented situation.

“There are no easy solutions,” Mr. Saale said. “I think the Israelis are pursuing the right course. You can’t let the hostages dictate what you are doing. Continuing to put a lot of pressure on Hamas is probably the best way to get them back. Hamas isn’t going to free hostages from a position of strength.”

Lt. Gen. Mark C. Schwartz, a retired Special Operations commander who formerly served as U.S. security coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority, said that Israel has likely embedded commandos within its advancing ground units so that they can act quickly if they receive fresh intelligence on hostage locations.

Other former senior officers who have served combat tours in the Middle East painted a grim picture of trying to recover the hostages — either through negotiations or military rescue — as Israeli forces pushed deeper into Gaza.

Gen. Richard D. Clarke, a retired head of the U.S. Special Operations Command, said the conditions in Gaza — an active war zone, the large number of hostages, scarce intelligence on their exact locations and Hamas’s preparations to defend against an Israeli assault — make any hostage recovery operation “extremely challenging.”

“Getting the hostages out will be very difficult,” said Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., a retired head of the U.S. military’s Central Command. “Hamas will try to create dilemmas for the Israelis — putting them near command posts, rocket launching sites and ammo dumps — as long as they can.”

The three generals all predicted a lengthy fight, possibly taking months.

“I do not think Hamas will fold,” said General Schwartz. “They want to kill Israeli soldiers, and I expect there to be brutal fighting.”

Yair Golan, a former deputy chief of staff in the Israel Defense Forces who helped rescue partygoers at a music festival that was attacked on Oct. 7, said the hostages have to be a priority as Israel conducts the war against Hamas."
111,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/world/europe/israel-biden-netanyahu-hamas.html,"In the wake of a visit by President Biden, Israelis on Thursday praised his courage in coming at a time of war and for his full-throated support, as he pledged “we will not let you ever be alone” after attacks from Hamas killed at least 1,400 Israelis.

But while the words were welcome, there was also concern that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, badly damaged by his failure to protect Israelis, had given Mr. Biden too much influence over how Israel should now fight its war in Gaza against Hamas, the group that controls the enclave.

Mr. Biden embraced Israel, but also cautioned it not to overreach to its detriment in the region — and implicitly, to the detriment of the United States. He even attended a war cabinet to be briefed on Israel’s plans, as Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken did before him.

This degree of consultation is rare, if not unprecedented, even in a relationship this close, Israeli analysts said. If it has potential benefits for Mr. Netanyahu, it also carries risks. It may give him political cover for an extended war, but it may also constrain how he conducts it."
112,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/arts/music/israeli-palestinian-barenboim-peacemaking.html,"In an interview after a recent rehearsal, Mr. Barenboim said he worried the latest war could morph into a “world catastrophe” in the absence of more efforts to bring Israelis and Palestinians together.

“There’s no use saying, ‘We the Jews have suffered more than anybody else,’ or the Palestinians’ saying, ‘We suffered more than all of you,’” he said. “This has been a very difficult century with little rest. I think we have to keep going, and forget our own positions, and get along with a sense of equality.”

The school year at the Barenboim-Said Academy began this month with the usual orientation sessions on Israeli-Palestinian tensions, how to respect differences and ways to see beyond stereotypes.

Then came the deadly Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7 and the ensuing Israeli strikes on Gaza. Many students, their phones buzzing with frantic messages from friends and relatives and displaying images of devastation, were too disturbed to practice their instruments. The school’s leaders, including Regula Rapp, the rector, and Mr. Barenboim’s son, Michael, who serves as dean, brought in counselors fluent in Hebrew and Arabic.

The students made a point of checking in with each other, and they organized meetings to try to work through some of their differences. Unsure of what to say, they sometimes offered only hugs. At one point, they gathered for a start-of-the-semester dinner, sharing homemade dishes: hummus, baba ghanouj, labneh and bulgur salad.

Their conversations were sometimes tense, as musicians from Israel spoke of losing a sense of security and the Palestinians described life under the suffocating blockade Israel has imposed on Gaza for 16 years. The conversations were also deeply personal, with some students sharing stories of losing loved ones during decades of violence in the Middle East.

The students tried to support each other as they faced new difficulties in German society; the authorities banned many pro-Palestinian gatherings, and a synagogue in Berlin was attacked with firebombs. They met at their dorms or went out for beer and cigarettes and talked about how they felt guilty being away from their families.

Roshanak Rafani, 29, a percussionist from Tehran who is a member of the student government, said the tumult in the region could be shattering; she has at times contemplated abandoning her studies.

“Imagine that people are dying, and now I’m just practicing to see which hand I should put here or there,” she said. “We all feel this inner conflict.”

She added that the young musicians had gotten beyond their differences by embracing the idea that “we’re all students, and there is no side now for us here.”

“We’ve all accepted the fact that we cannot really convince each other about many things,” she said. “People talk and raise their voices and yell and cry, but two hours later, they are hugging each other.”

The war has hung over classroom discussions as well.

In a recent philosophy class, the topic was Plato’s allegory of the cave, a metaphor for contemplating the divide between ignorance and enlightenment."
113,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-arab-bedouins.html,"During their murderous Oct. 7 rampage, Hamas militants attacked Zikkim Beach near the Gaza Strip where Abd Alrahman Aatef Ziadna and his family had been camping along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.

Mr. Ziadna, 26, was slain inside his tent, and four members of his Bedouin family vanished.

Since the slaughter of 1,400 Israelis and foreigners by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, the world’s sympathies have focused on the Jewish communities closest to Gaza, where many of the victims lived. Atrocities were also committed against one of Israel’s more hidden minorities, Bedouin Arabs.

At least 17 people killed in the Hamas attacks were Bedouins from villages scattered around the Negev and Rahat, the biggest city in an impoverished, predominantly Bedouin area of southern Israel. Another victim there was an Arab paramedic from northern Israel who had come to work at the all-night music and dance festival where 260 people were slain.

Ayesha Ziadna, 29, a relative of the Ziadnas who were attacked on the beach, said that the four members of the family who disappeared are still missing, as are a number of other residents of the area, though the exact number was not immediately clear.

Dr. Yasmeen Abu Fraiha, who grew up in the Bedouin town of Tel Sheva, said she rushed to her hospital in Beer Sheva as the staff scrambled to treat hundreds of patients that day, including victims who had lost limbs and others who had been shot, including Bedouins. They treated children, seniors and foreigners too.

Hamas did not directly target Bedouins, but “rockets and bullets don’t discriminate,” Dr. Fraiha said.

In the wake of the attacks many Bedouins have lost their livelihoods at Israeli farms that were ransacked, creating extreme hardships for an already struggling community. “There are a lot of people who are suffering,” Ms. Ziadna said. “Many people are out of jobs. People are scared.”

Even before the recent attacks, Bedouins had long suffered at the hands of Hamas. Because many live in villages not recognized by Israel, they mostly lack the bomb shelters and health clinics that the government has made widely available in southern Israel. Even in Rahat, with a population of about 80,000, there were only about 10 bomb shelters, the city’s mayor, Ata Abu Mediam, told the Israeli news media.

When Hamas fires rockets, the people have nowhere to go, Ms. Ziadna said. The largely aluminum roofs of the Bedouin homes turn into deadly shrapnel, which she called “knives.” Hamas rockets killed several members of one Bedouin community."

From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise, and this is “The Daily.” President Biden arrived in Israel today as the crisis in the region deepened.

archived recording 1 We’re learning new details tonight about an explosion at a hospital in Gaza City. The Palestinian health ministry says hundreds of people killed, many more injured. archived recording 2 These are people who were likely being treated for injuries related to the war already.

sabrina tavernise

After a devastating blast at a Gaza hospital ignited protests across the broader Middle East and drew clashing claims over who was responsible —

archived recording 3 Palestinians in the West Bank, very agitated. archived recording 4 Yes, those chaotic scenes outside the US embassy in Beirut — angry protesters, Lebanese as well as Palestinians.

sabrina tavernise

— my colleague, Edward Wong, on America’s most difficult diplomatic mission —

archived recording 5 Anger is not just toward Israel. People are blaming the US administration.

sabrina tavernise

— support its ally while also preventing a wider war. It’s Wednesday, October 18. So Ed, we have a deteriorating situation in the Middle East. You’ve been very focused on American diplomacy in this moment, and you’ve been traveling with American officials all over the region for the past week. Tell us what they’ve been trying to do.

edward wong

Sabrina, this is the most intense diplomatic scramble I’ve seen among US officials in the time I’ve been covering foreign policy and diplomacy in Washington. And it’s obvious, because the stakes are very high. The US wants to show full support for Israel, which is a very close partner in a region where many countries have been hostile to it. Then, there’s this growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza as Israel carries out its airstrikes and prepares a ground invasion there. And on top of all that, you’ve got the possibility of this becoming a wider regional conflict, and US officials are desperately trying to head that off. So from the very beginning of this crisis, American officials have been involved. We saw the US immediately come out and condemn the attacks by Hamas right after they took place on October 7, on a Saturday. And then, over that weekend, there were a lot of intense discussions between President Biden and foreign leaders in the region to really try and get them on board with a consistent message about the attacks. I know that the US officials and US leaders were intensely focused on showing strong and unwavering American support for Israel at that time and for whatever Israel planned to do — its military strikes, its retaliation against Hamas. And they also wanted to speak with Arab leaders in order to try and persuade the leaders to condemn Hamas and condemn the attacks and show as much support for Israel as they could.

sabrina tavernise

And Ed, why was it so important to get Arab countries to sign on to condemn the attack?

edward wong

Well, given the scale of the attacks, I think that the US felt they had an opening to try and get Arab nations and Arab leaders on board with what Israel is about to do. As you know, Sabrina, the Palestinians are seen as victims by many Arab citizens across the region. I would say that the majority of people who live in the Middle East see Israel as an occupier and see America as the backer of this occupation. So even an attack like the Hamas attack will be seen as justified by many just ordinary people in the region. And I think that the US was hoping that the governments and the leaders of the region would help set the tone, would help guide public opinion, by coming out and being more forceful in their condemnation of these attacks.

sabrina tavernise

So what happens? Do any of them condemn Hamas and the attack?

edward wong

Well, there are a couple Arab countries that do come out strongly against Hamas. Over that weekend to Monday, we see the United Arab Emirates put out a statement that forcefully says Hamas was not right in doing these attacks and naming Hamas. And we also see Bahrain, a smaller country in the Gulf region, also put out a similar statement and naming Hamas. And what’s interesting is that these two countries had signed on a few years ago to what are known as the Abraham Accords, which were these agreements that the Trump administration really pushed in a diplomatic effort to try and get Arab countries to normalize relations with Israel. But Saudi Arabia, for example, makes a statement that essentially says, oh, we told you for years that the Israeli occupation of Gaza would lead to reactions that you won’t like. Qatar, another Arab country, comes out with a statement that says Israel is solely responsible for these attacks. And that did not please US officials at all, of course.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so the US doesn’t get much in this initial round of private calls, this initial flurry of diplomacy. What does it do next?

edward wong

So on the Tuesday after the attacks —

archived recording (joe biden) Good afternoon. You know, there are moments in this life — I mean this literally — when the pure, unadulterated evil is unleashed.

edward wong

— President Biden comes out and gives what many people describe as one of the most emotional speeches of his career.

archived recording (joe biden) Young people massacred while attending a musical festival to celebrate peace, to celebrate peace —

edward wong

He forcefully condemns the attacks. He describes in detail how horrific they are.

archived recording (joe biden) — families hid their fear for hours and hours, desperately trying to keep their children quiet to avoid drawing attention.

edward wong

He evokes the history of persecution against Jews.

archived recording (joe biden) This attack has brought to the surface painful memories, the scars left by a millennia of anti-Semitism and genocide of the Jewish people.

edward wong

He tells Americans —

archived recording (joe biden) We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself.

edward wong

And he described to the American people how he promised to the Israeli leader that the United States would support Israel in whatever actions it takes.

archived recording (joe biden) These atrocities have been sickening. We’re with Israel. Let’s make no mistake. Thank you.

edward wong

And Sabrina, that same day, I was also getting a flurry of messages from the State Department telling me to pack my bags, because Tony Blinken, the Secretary of State, was about to go on one of the biggest diplomatic trips of his career.

sabrina tavernise

So publicly, this overwhelming support for Israel in this moment by the US. But at this point, Israel has also started bombing in Gaza. Right? So how is the US viewing that? And what’s it saying to Israel about it, either in public or behind the scenes?

edward wong

Well, that’s interesting, Sabrina, because this was something that I watched change as I was following Tony Blinken around the region during this past week. So when Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv, he put out a very strong message of unwavering and unconditional support for Israel. He stood next to Netanyahu and talked about how Israel had an obligation to defend itself and that the US completely understood what Israel was about to do in Gaza. But as Blinken is traveling around the region and going to visit with Arab leaders in a total of around a half-dozen Arab countries in the area, he hears a lot of concerns about the civilian casualties. And so I think that this really impacted the thinking of US officials, and President Biden and Blinken were talking intensely during Blinken’s trip. And we saw Blinken as he stood next to Arab officials, giving press conferences across the region, talking more and more also about the need to address the suffering of the two million people in Gaza.

sabrina tavernise

And just to remind listeners here, Israel had shut off power, water, and food to Gaza. The bombing has been causing this deepening humanitarian crisis. I’d imagine this was pretty worrisome to a lot of Arab leaders.

edward wong

That’s right, Sabrina. They really are pushing for the US to tell the Israelis, please, back off from this cutoff of water, this cutoff of electricity, this cutoff of food. And we’re seeing all these images coming out, of people fleeing the cities, of the rubble, and bodies being pulled out of the rubble. And I know that US officials at this time were then really pressing the Israelis to start restoring some of these basic services.

sabrina tavernise

And were Israelis heeding what US officials were telling them? Were they doing that restoration of services?

edward wong

The Israeli officials were very reluctant to change this intense form of warfare that they were waging on the people in Gaza. They felt completely justified in this. They aim to wipe out Hamas, and they felt the siege warfare was important for that. But they did feel pressure from US officials on some of these basic services. And they told the US officials that they were turning on one pipe that could provide water to Gaza. But without electricity, water is apparently still not running through that pipe to the people of Gaza.

sabrina tavernise

And what about food and supplies?

edward wong

Well, Sabrina, there’s only one land border crossing into Gaza, and that’s through Egypt. It’s a place called Rafah. And so US officials start negotiating with people from different governments. So they talk to the Egyptians. The Egyptians say they definitely want to make sure that aid gets through that border. Israelis are very reluctant to open it. They have argued that over the years, Hamas has gotten weapons through that border, and they don’t want that border to be open as they’re waging war on Hamas. They’ve even done some airstrikes, dropping bombs right around the border. And so the Americans are talking to Israel to try and get them to hold back from doing airstrikes or bombing on that border and trying to persuade them that getting humanitarian aid to Gaza is a valid effort. And we have to also remember that it’s not Israel that controls that border. Hamas does control that border. And so the Americans are also trying to pass messages via officials in Qatar to Hamas to try and tell Hamas, we want to bring humanitarian aid through, and please open the border when the trucks start coming through.

sabrina tavernise

Qatar is a country in the Gulf that has, in the past, passed messages to Hamas, had relations with Hamas, and is close. Therefore, that’s how the US is communicating with Hamas.

edward wong

That’s right. And another important point about this border is that American officials have been trying to get Palestinian Americans out of Gaza via this border crossing. So they’ve been trying to talk to these countries to open up the crossing to American citizens with valid documents. And we know that other governments are also talking with Egypt, with Israel, to try and get the border crossing open for their citizens, too.

sabrina tavernise

So Blinken is working on getting Americans out and aid in. But what about everybody else in Gaza? I mean, there are two million people there. Presumably, some number of civilians there would leave if they could. What about them?

edward wong

Well, what we know is that Israel will do its offensive in northern Gaza. They’ve been telling people in the north of Gaza to move down to the south, and there’s a lot of people who want to get out of Gaza through the south, through this land border. But as American officials travel around the region and talk with Arab leaders, they’re discovering that the refugee issue is a very complicated one. Arab nations are reluctant to take the refugees for various reasons. They don’t want a refugee crisis in their own borders, but they also don’t think that Israel should be forcing the relocation of Palestinians. There are intense historical echoes of what happened decades ago to Palestinians. And I was even hearing from Palestinians and Palestinian Americans who were outraged by the fact that Israel was calling for people to move out of northern Gaza. And also, they were afraid that once Palestinians left Gaza entirely, that they would not be able to go back. So there’s a very complicated set of considerations here.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so the stakes are extremely high here, right? I mean, two million Gazans — they have nowhere to go, effectively. There’s a worsening humanitarian crisis. Israel is attacking from the air and clearly preparing for a ground invasion. Is the US exerting pressure on Israel at all to ease its approach, or even to reverse its plans to invade?

edward wong

Well, what we’re hearing from US officials is that they’re still fully behind whatever offensive Israel is planning in Gaza. They know that Israel has been deeply wounded in physical and spiritual and psychological ways by the Hamas attacks, and also that Israel needs to show its adversaries around the region, namely other militias and Iran, that it can protect itself. And so the US feels strongly supportive of that. And for example, we know that Pentagon officials are talking with Israeli officials about lessons that the US has learned over decades of doing urban warfare and what fight in Gaza City might entail. But at the same time, we’re also hearing lots of anxiety from American officials about the prospects of a much wider regional war. They think that once the ground invasion of Gaza starts and we see even bloodier images, that there will be massive concerns around the region and that other armed groups that are supportive of Hamas will start taking part in the war. And the US officials that I’ve been traveling with this week — one of their big pushes is to really try and keep this war from becoming a huge regional conflict that could draw the US in and put the US military squarely back in the Middle East again.

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] So Ed, you said that the US officials you’re talking to are very worried that this war could turn into an even bigger conflict, one that spills out into the broader region. Let’s start to unpack that.

edward wong

Well, Sabrina, we’ve been talking all this time about Hamas, which is this group that’s based in Gaza on the southern side of Israel. But up in the north, Lebanon borders Israel, and there, Israel faces attacks from a very powerful militia, Hezbollah, that’s based in south Lebanon.

sabrina tavernise

And give us a primer on Hezbollah. Remind us why it’s such a threat to Israel and the US.

edward wong

Well, Hezbollah has a very unique position in Lebanon. There’s a political wing that has seats in the government, and there’s also a very powerful military wing. This military wing has many fighters who are well trained. They have thousands of rockets, and they get a lot of backing from Iran, which is one of the most powerful countries in the region. In the 1980s, it carried out some of the most devastating terrorist attacks against US interests. It carried out a bombing of the American embassy in Beirut in 1983. And it also carried out another bombing, this one of Marine barracks in Lebanon. The US has designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.

sabrina tavernise

And Hezbollah has, similar to Hamas, made its mission to fight and destroy Israel.

edward wong

That’s right, Sabrina. But Hezbollah is the much more powerful actor. It’s better funded. It’s better organized. Its fighters are better trained. And its weapons systems are more powerful and more sophisticated.

sabrina tavernise

So Hezbollah, a militia in Lebanon, is similar to Hamas in many ways, including being funded by Iran. But it’s also different, because it’s a more effective, more powerful fighting force. And of course, it kept having wars with Israel right over that border into Israel’s north. I myself covered one of those wars in 2006. And it was extremely taxing for the Israeli military — tied up their ground forces, took them weeks to extract themselves. So it has been quite a force in Israel’s north for many, many years. But what about now, with the attack on Israel last weekend?

edward wong

We’ve seen an uptick in some of the exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah in the north. So Hezbollah has been firing more rockets, and Israel has recently told its citizens who are living up in those towns bordering Lebanon to start moving south. Israel knows that things could heat up very quickly there.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so there’s been rocket fire since the attack on Israel. How has the United States been viewing that?

edward wong

Well, US officials are very anxious about this. They’re afraid that Hezbollah might decide to mount a full-on assault on Israel as Israel carries out its war against Hamas in the south. So the US is watching this very carefully. And to try and deter Hezbollah from doing anything, it has sent two aircraft carriers to the region. One of them, the Gerald R. Ford, is already there, and the other one, the Eisenhower, is moving there right now. It’s also sent a few thousand troops to the region, but it says that those troops, for now, will not get involved in combat.

sabrina tavernise

So the Americans are effectively reading the tea leaves of this bit of rocket fire that started last week from the north, from Hezbollah. They’re worried about a wider war, and they’re sending these ships to the region, presumably to try to stop that from happening.

edward wong

Right. US aircraft carriers are among the most powerful weapons in the US military system, and other countries know that. So the US is hoping that Hezbollah and its main backer, Iran, will read this, and they’ll realize that if Hezbollah starts military assaults in northern Israel, that they will incur a great cost. And so they’re hoping that there’s a big deterrence factor to having these warships there. But you know, we all know that Israel is planning a huge ground invasion of Gaza. And if it goes into Gaza with troops and do street-by-street fighting, it could get very bloody and very violent there. We’ll see many civilian casualties, probably, even beyond what we’re seeing with airstrikes right now. And then, Hezbollah might feel obligated, or they might feel the desire to open up a northern front there in Israel. And many people who’ve looked at Israel’s military say that military, even though it’s very well trained, is not powerful enough to fight a two-front war. And I think US officials are also wary of the other scenario, which is Iran getting directly involved. That’s one of their biggest fears. Their assessment right now out is that Iran doesn’t want to get involved in a regional war. But a downward spiral of events could end up drawing Iran into a war. They can’t discount that possibility.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so these are some of the calculations that US policymakers are making. And the big fear is that there will be a second front in Lebanon with Hezbollah, or even that Iran itself, Hezbollah’s backer, would get involved. What is the US doing to try to head this off?

edward wong

Well, that’s where we’re seeing a lot of urgent diplomacy taking place. So I’ve witnessed that this past week, as I’ve been traveling around the region with Tony Blinken and his aides. They’re trying to communicate to Iran. They’re trying to get partner countries, even some of their rivals, to pass messages on to Iran. So for example, they’ve spoken about this with Qatar, which is a US partner, and they’re telling Qatari officials to talk to one of their other partners, which is Iran, that Iran should hold back. And there was even one day during his travels here when Blinken decided to call Wang Yi, China’s top diplomat, because he wanted to try and tell China to persuade Iran to stay out of the fight.

sabrina tavernise

So Ed, as we know, President Biden has made the choice to travel to Israel at this incredibly sensitive moment. What do you think he’s trying to accomplish with this visit?

edward wong

Well, Biden is trying to do several things. He wants to show full support for Israel, for the war that it’s waging. He also wants to make sure that Israel and other governments in the region commit to getting humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza. That’s becoming a much bigger crisis. And he also wants to, again, send that message of deterrence to other adversaries of Israel and say, I’m here, America is here, and if you get involved in this war, then you’ll feel America’s wrath. But of course, it’s also a very fraught time for him to be going to Israel. The airstrikes are intensifying in Gaza. We’re seeing many more images of civilians who’ve been killed in these strikes. And just today, we got news that there was an explosion at a hospital in Gaza where hundreds of people were killed, and some of the images of the aftermath are absolutely horrific. Hamas came out with a statement saying that this was the result of an Israeli airstrike, and Israel has said that’s not the case. Fighters in Gaza might have fired an errant rocket that landed on the hospital.

sabrina tavernise

Yeah, the videos circulating online do, as you say, show these unbelievably horrific images. Clearly, the details of what exactly happened — they are still coming to light. Israel has said it wasn’t them, but the images are out there circulating and make this an incredibly wrenching moment for the Palestinians. And Biden’s trip is set to place him in the middle of this, which presumably makes his job of preventing the conflict from spreading harder.

edward wong

It definitely ties Biden and America much closer to this war that Israel is waging, this war that Israel feels is justified. But it will evoke a strong reaction from Arabs across the region, and even from some governments that the US usually relies on to be its partners in the region.

sabrina tavernise

So Ed, I want to step back for a minute here. You’ve just spent seven straight days traveling with American officials around the Middle East. They’re racing to contain the threat of wider war. How do you see this moment, based on what you’re hearing from them?

edward wong

Well, I think it’s a very anxious moment. I think it feels like we’re in the edge of an abyss, potentially. If this widens into a regional war, it could be the biggest event in the Middle East in many years, perhaps since the American invasion of Iraq and the Arab Spring and those revolutions. And I think that the American officials are very, very worried about the US getting involved in another major war in the Middle East. They know that our country has been scarred by these wars. And some of the conversations that I’ve had with the US officials as I’ve been traveling around with them have been among the bleakest I’ve had since covering this diplomatic beat. There’s a very grim atmosphere here. They definitely know things could get much, much worse. But also, these US officials tell me they need to stand strong with Israel. They say Israel is a partner, it’s an ally, and that America has promised to defend Israel through the decades against its enemies.

sabrina tavernise

Ed, we started this episode asking how the US was getting involved in this conflict and, you know, how it was trying to thread a needle — support Israel, even if it goes, down the road, to a ground invasion while, at the same time, easing the humanitarian crisis and containing the broader war. In some ways, what we’re seeing now — images from the hospital and the bombings of the past week — is potentially just the beginning. So you’re talking to officials. What price will US officials be willing to pay for this support of Israel.?

edward wong

Well, the officials tell me that their support and their resolve is steadfast. But I think what’s going to happen is when you see that tested many, many times over the coming weeks and the coming months. This is just the start of the war. The Israelis say they’re ready to fight a long war against Hamas and against any other adversaries that get involved. And in these areas, there are many, many civilians. And I think that both the Americans and the Israelis are gritting their teeth and saying, we’re going ahead. But then the question is, as these images keep coming out and as public opinion starts to turn more against Israel, how resolute will these American officials be? Will they start to wonder whether they’ll pay a political price, for example, for continued support of Israel? And will they decide they need to push back against some of Israel’s military tactics in the area? I think these are all questions that will become even greater in relevance as this war goes on.

sabrina tavernise

Ed, thank you.

edward wong

Thanks, Sabrina.

On his diplomatic trip to the Middle East, President Biden had planned to visit Jordan, where he would meet with Palestinian leaders. But on Tuesday afternoon, that summit was abruptly canceled after the blast at the hospital. The situation deteriorated throughout the evening, with defiant crowds of protesters clashing with security forces in Amman and in Beirut. And in Iran, the country’s foreign minister who, on Monday, had warned that multiple fronts would open against Israel if attacks against Palestinians continued, said that time was up. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you should know today.

115,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/opinion/israel-gaza-hamas-kidnapping.html,"Inon is an outlier, but he’s not alone, and I’ve been speaking with several of those here in Israel who lost loved ones to the terror attacks yet argue that the next step should not be further destruction heaped on Gaza, even in the name of destroying Hamas.

These are Israelis in anguish at their own losses and also fearful that their suffering is being used to justify bombardments and a ground invasion of Gaza, killing innocents there and perpetuating bloodshed. I can’t emphasize enough that this attitude is the exception, but perhaps that’s why I find it so majestic.

I’ve been following the Middle East conflict for most of my life, and I can’t remember a time of such despair, trauma and mutual mistrust. It’s heartbreaking to see the collapse of all hope, and this month may be the nadir: the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and a devastating air assault and siege of Gaza that has claimed even more lives there.

In this grim context, people like Inon remind me of the human capacity for empathy and wisdom — two qualities desperately needed across the region. I told him he was out of step with the public mood, for most people have drawn a different lesson from history: that it is important to wipe out enemies who want to kill you.

“We have been doing exactly that,” he said, referring to reliance on military solutions, yet noted that that approach failed to keep his parents alive. “What I’m saying is we have to stop doing what we were doing before. We need a new policy.”

“Someone needs to be brave enough to stop the cycle of blood, dislike and violence that has been going on for a century,” he said.

This may require Gandhian levels of inner fortitude."

Along with another girl that came running to us. “We’re saying again” [Unclear] “We have here 400 people working 24/7 in shifts trying to identify the kidnapped people.” “And you find here people coming from all over Israel, young, old, experts and researchers of artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies.” We actually started as an organization that opposed judiciary reform in Israel. And when the war began, we decided to shift everything that we do. There is so much to do. And there is a huge gap right now between what the government can and do to support and what the civilians are doing on support. We are working really closely with other types of agencies, government agencies. Excuse me for a second. This is the high justice court president. Just a second. “Sorry.” Right now, we have around some hundreds of problems of missing people that we try to understand whether they’re missing or whether they’re dead. We are not the army. We are civilians and can only use open information. You want to look in the Facebook, internet, whatever you can. This is something that tech can help. So let me give you an example. We saw a video of a wife and a husband sitting on the floor where a Hamas person is with a rifle above their head. Using techniques of sound and using techniques of A.I., by identifying the specific fabric of their underwear, we were able to find another video where you don’t see his face. That means that the Hamas took him in captive and we think he’s dead or unconscious. I have another example. A father got interviewed to one of the channels. He showed the movie of his kid and three children where a soldier protects them. We knew that their life — when they came back to find their children, they didn’t find anything, only traces of blood. So they thought they were captured. Two minutes after, a woman calls me and said, I have the two minutes after the video of the father that showed you. And I said, what? What the video shows. She sent it to me. And unfortunately, at that video, we see the children slaughtered. So we know that if they are in Gaza, they are dead or they are somewhere in Israel as a corpse, but they are not, unfortunately, alive. Those are kinds of information that is tragic information, but it’s very important for the families to know that. People are coming day after day, making sure that we find another person, another person. I was not a combat soldier in the army. I was doing tech also in the army. But here, sitting together, shoulder to shoulder, I learned how to fight."
117,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-invasion-secrecy.html,"When Israeli ground forces advanced en masse into the Gaza Strip on Friday evening, just after the Jewish Sabbath began, they did it so secretly that it was hours before the outside world understood what had happened.

In the three days since the long-anticipated invasion began, Israel’s military has operated with a similar ambiguity, defying expectations by carrying out a more incremental ground operation than was initially anticipated. While it has continued to decimate Gaza and its people with aerial bombardments, much of the ground force appears to have hung back from Gaza City, Hamas’s stronghold in northern Gaza, and stayed instead in the countryside on the city’s fringes.

Under U.S. pressure to temper their response to the Hamas killing of more than 1,400 people on Israeli soil, Israel has even avoided describing the operation as an invasion. The loss of life, though, in Gaza continues to rise, with the Palestinian death toll so far over 8,000, according to Hamas officials.

“Everything is happening in darkness,” said Andreas Krieg, a war expert at King’s College, London, adding that “there’s a very small group of people who actually know what’s going on, even inside Israel.”"
118,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/opinion/israel-gaza-war.html,"What should Israel do to ensure that an attack like the one launched by Hamas never happens again? I don’t know right now. I just know that whatever the answer is, it’s not mobilizing 360,000 traumatized Israeli reservists to launch into an urban war in one of the most densely populated places in the world. This will crush the Israeli economy and its international standing.

All these dilemmas must push Biden to sharpen his stance on the crisis.

Biden must realize that Benjamin Netanyahu is unfit to manage this war as a rational player. After such a colossal defeat, the most powerful and unifying thing Netanyahu could have done was call new Israeli elections in six or nine months — and announce that he would not be running; he is ending his career in politics, and therefore Israelis can trust that whatever decisions he makes about Gaza and Hamas now will have only the Israeli national interest in mind; he will not have in mind his own interest in staying out of jail on corruption charges, which requires his holding on to the right-wing crazies in his government (who actually fantasize about Israel reoccupying Gaza and rebuilding the Israeli settlements there) by chasing some big, short-term military victory that he can take to the Israeli electorate as a compensation for the debacle that just happened.

As one of Israel’s best military writers, Amos Harel of Haaretz, wrote on Friday: “There is an unusual combination of people at the top in Israel. On one hand, there is an unfit prime minister, a nearly Shakespearean figure who is facing the personal danger of an ignominious conclusion to an arguably brilliant career. Facing him are a military brass who are smitten and consumed with guilt feelings (and if only Netanyahu would bother displaying a smidgen of that). That’s not a perfect recipe for considered decision making.”

If Israel were to announce today that it has decided for now to forgo an invasion of Gaza and will look for more surgical means to eliminate or capture Hamas’s leadership while trying to engineer a trade for the more than 150 Israeli and other hostages whom Hamas is holding, it would not only avoid further traumatizing its own society, as well as Palestinian civilians in Gaza; it would also give Israel and its allies time to think through how to build — with Palestinians — a legitimate alternative to Hamas.

Such a move would earn Israel a lot of support globally and enable the world to see Hamas for what it is: the ISIS of the Palestinian territories."
119,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/nyregion/jewish-burials-israel-americans.html,"The reasons Jews desire a grave in Israel can be religious: Believers say soil there absolves sin. (Indeed, many interred outside of the country are buried with a sprinkling of Israeli dirt along with them.) Many secular Jews hope to end up in the Jewish state, even as it remains a fault line.

“All the adversity they have endured through decades and decades of hostility, they finally found through the state of Israel, a homeland,” said Peter C. DeLuca, the director of Beth Abraham Memorial Chapel in Greenwich Village, who said he has in the past sent bodies to Israel — including those of several people who had never visited the country while they were alive. “And going home is very, very important.”

With more than 4,000 Palestinians killed since the fighting broke out, and Gaza under bombardment, Israeli Arabs too are struggling to bury their dead. For American Muslims who seek to be buried in Palestinian territory, they typically wish to do so not for religious reasons but because they were born there or have family from there, said Kareem Elmatbagi, the owner of Islamic International Funeral Services in Brooklyn. All soil is considered sacred, according to the Quran, he added.

Mr. Elmatbagi regularly arranges for people to be buried in homelands across the Arab world, but when it comes to Israel, he said, the bureaucratic hurdles for Muslim burials are vastly more complicated — he often flies the coffins to Jordan, where they are shipped overland to avoid the red tape.

When the coffins arrive, the cemeteries where they may finally rest are sharply circumscribed, he said. In 2021, Israel razed part of Al-Yusufiyah, a Muslim cemetery in Jerusalem. “It is heartbreaking,” Mr. Elmatbagi said.

A burial in Israel can be expensive — upward of $3,000 to fly before other burial expenses, according to the United States Embassy in Jerusalem. It can also be fraught: Even in better times, burials on disputed territory, like the Mount of Olives cemetery overlooking Jerusalem, have been subject to attacks. Especially now, with inhabitants of Israel struggling to bury their own dead and with more fighting on the horizon, the practice is daunting.

But the burials have continued, according to rabbis and funeral directors.

Since the war began on Oct. 7, Bais Yisroel Chapel in Spring Valley, N.Y., which provides funeral arrangements mainly for Hasidic Jews, has sent more than a half-dozen New Yorkers to be buried in Israel, according to a person familiar with the situation who did not wish to disclose his name because of concerns of antisemitism.

The bodies arrive via the Israeli airline El Al, he said, one of the few airlines that did not suspend flights immediately following the outbreak of war. (El Al did not respond to a request for comment.) On the tarmac in Lod, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, they are met by chevra kadisha members.

The chevra kadisha (which translates as “holy society,”) exist in all Jewish communities: It is a spiritual designation for those who do things like perform ritual baths for the deceased, dig their graves and ensure Jewish funeral rites are carried out. To serve as one is considered Judaism’s highest, most altruistic good deed — the person you are helping can never return the favor.

“They are at risk,” said the man at Bais Yisroel Chapel. “But they do it because they are chevra kadisha, for the dignity for the bodies.” He added, “Any Jew who has a Jewish heart, this hits them emotionally.”"
120,https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000009138378/biden-israel-netanyahu-visit.html,"In the wake of Hamas’s appalling terrorist assault — it was brutal, inhumane, almost beyond belief what they did — this cabinet came together, and standing strong, standing united. And I want you to know you’re not alone. You are not alone. As I emphasized earlier, we will continue to have Israel’s back as you work to defend your people. I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday. And based on what I’ve seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you."
121,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/business/hamas-attack-hollywood-jews.html,"With the exception of the rare conservative, Hollywood has long seemed to exist in an ideological bubble — a bastion of progressive politics, where Jewish people have thrived, Democratic politicians have been celebrated and stars have espoused liberal ideas from the Oscar stage and rushed to support movements like Black Lives Matter.

For the most part, people in the entertainment world could trust that they were on the same political page.

That changed abruptly with the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Reactions to the assault, and to Israel’s retaliation, have revealed a schism that many in Hollywood did not realize was there, and it has left many Jews feeling like outsiders in an industry they founded and where they have long felt safe and supported.

“There are divides that never really get talked about,” said the veteran screenwriter Barry Schkolnick, whose credits include TV shows like “Law & Order” and “The Good Wife.” “This has brought them to the surface, and it’s hurtful and disorienting.”

Many say they are disillusioned — and angered — by the trickle of public condemnation from Hollywood regarding the Oct. 7 attack. There was no flood of support on social media from celebrities. Most studios initially tried to duck, staying silent. One leading union, the Writers Guild of America, refused to put out a statement, and stuck with its decision in the face of enormous backlash from hundreds of its members.

“The silence has been deafening,” Jonathan Greenblatt, the director of the Anti-Defamation League, told The Wrap, an entertainment trade news site, on Oct. 12.

A few statements and open letters condemning the Hamas attacks started to arrive. But the damage had been done.

To the producer Jeremy Steckler, “the lack of support feels like they’re punching me in my heart and in my identity.”

“I’ve never been somebody who’s been highly attentive to identity or specific religion,” he said. “I’ve always just thought I was in this little bubble and everyone’s supportive and it’s L.A. and no big deal. It’s really in the last week, have I woken up and felt othered.”

While the effect is pronounced in Hollywood, where there is a large Jewish presence, the entirety of liberal America has been similarly convulsed. On Capitol Hill, across college campuses and among progressive activist groups and philanthropies, a raw divide has emerged. On one side, there is ardent support for Israel. On the other is an energized faction who view the Palestinian cause as an extension of the racial and social justice movements that swept through the United States in the summer of 2020. And there are others, including Jewish people, calling for a cease-fire.

In Hollywood, the most prominent example of the fraught nature of the moment is the controversy involving the writers’ guild, which represents more than 11,000 screenwriters.

Jewish writers reacted with horror to the guild’s refusal to condemn the attacks on Israel. Some threatened to leave the union, while others, including the writer and producer Marc Guggenheim (“Arrow,” “Carnival Row”), said they were withholding dues. But an anonymous pro-Palestinian group calling itself WGA for Peace applauded the union’s decision, saying its members were scared to identify themselves because they would be labeled antisemitic.

“After Oct. 7, it wouldn’t have been hard for people to put out statements that said under no circumstances is rape or murder or kidnapping of civilians acceptable — and we need to work toward a just future for Jews and Palestinians in Israel and Palestine,” said Rabbi Sharon Brous, founder and senior rabbi of Ikar, a congregation in Los Angeles where many screenwriters, directors and Hollywood executives are members.

“But that’s not what happened,” she said. “And so as a result, a lot of people are shocked, afraid.”"
122,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-raid-hamas.html,"The Israeli military launched a particularly intense bombardment of the Gaza Strip late on Friday and said it was “expanding ground activity” there overnight, while cellular and internet service abruptly vanished for much of the territory, raising the possibility that a full-scale invasion was underway or imminent.

It was not clear whether the escalation in Israeli operations signaled a coming invasion, which Israeli officials have hinted at since the deadly Oct. 7 incursion into Israel led by Hamas, the armed militant group that controls Gaza. But the military statements came after two consecutive nights of raids into Gaza by Israeli ground forces — incursions it has described as laying the groundwork for the next phase of the war, whatever shape that may take.

Israeli leaders, who have vowed to remove Hamas from power, had been deliberating how, when — and even whether — to invade, as diplomats conducted back-channel negotiations aimed at freeing hostages held by Hamas. The government says that the Oct. 7 attack killed more than 1,400 people and seized more than 200 captives who are being held in Gaza.

Until this week, the Israeli war effort has relied almost entirely on airstrikes and artillery, a campaign that the Hamas authorities say has killed more than 7,000 people and that aid agencies say has displaced more than a million.

International pressure is growing for a cease-fire and for more humanitarian aid to reach Gaza, where conditions are fast deteriorating. But the Israeli government, backed by the Biden administration, so far has shown no openness to a cease-fire, which a White House spokesman said this week “only benefits Hamas.”

Israel was “expanding ground activity” in Gaza during the night, the military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a news briefing on Friday evening, but he did not elaborate on what that would mean, and did not refer to a full-scale offensive."

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING

The House enters another week without a speaker. A vote has been set for as soon as tomorrow on a new leader, but huge divisions remain, prolonging Washington’s legislative paralysis. Republicans have nominated Jim Jordan of Ohio as speaker, but dozens from his party remain opposed to him.

A veteran activist investor takes aim at News Corp. Starboard Value, the hedge fund that has previously taken on Salesforce and the parent of Olive Garden, has amassed a stake in Rupert Murdoch’s news publisher, according to The Wall Street Journal. It wants to make big changes including spinning out News Corp.’s digital real estate arm, but the Murdochs’ 40 percent voting stake in the company is a significant hurdle.

A British billionaire nears a minority stake in Manchester United. Jim Ratcliffe, the owner of the chemicals conglomerate Ineos, is negotiating to invest in the English soccer club after a rival bidder, a Qatari sheikh, dropped out, according to The Athletic. His offer for perhaps 25 percent of United could value the club at over $6 billion — but falls short of the full sale that some investors and fans had hoped for.

Taylor Swift breaks records at the box office, too. The mega pop star’s concert film, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” grossed an estimated $95 million to $97 million in North America this weekend in the biggest-ever debut for the genre. (It may even have surpassed “Joker” for biggest October premiere.) Her movie comes at a tough time for theaters, given that many blockbusters have been delayed; Swift herself is expected to have taken home close to $55 million from this weekend’s sales, taking a higher-than-usual percentage of box office revenues."
124,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/opinion/palestine-biden-activists-israel.html,"Since the heinous Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and Israel’s declaration of war against the terrorist group, I have been going over and over a question I’ve not been able to answer fully: During this episode, why has the Palestinian cause sparked so much passion among veteran activists of the movement for Black lives?

Last week, I wrote that this could be traced to the ideological lens and residual energy of a younger generation attuned to protest and the ideas of equality and justice. But after interviewing several prominent activists in recent days, I realize there’s more to explore in the critical dynamics fueling that passion, which is born, in part, out of longstanding personal connections and a common sense of purpose.

There are two pivotal events that seem to have ignited the new era of solidarity between some young American activists and the people of Palestine. The first came in the form of Palestinian activists expressing support on social media for the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Mo., which activists describe as an uprising, not just a series of protests. Palestinians provided not just moral support, but offered practical tips that, as activist Cherrell Brown told me, included advice for protesters about how to protect themselves from tear gas.

Around that time, a small delegation of Palestinians even traveled to Ferguson and St. Louis to meet with American activists. This all created a moment of bonding around a shared sense of resistance.

The second event was a 2015 pilgrimage to Israel and the Palestinian territories organized by Ahmad Abuznaid, a Jerusalem-born Palestinian American who co-founded the Dream Defenders, a group of activists who came together in response to the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin.

The small delegation included some people who would also become central in the American movement, like the journalist and scholar Marc Lamont Hill."
125,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-netanyahu.html,"Israel continued to warn hospitals in northern Gaza to evacuate, the World Health Organization said overnight. But the W.H.O. said it was impossible to move without risking patients’ lives, and health officials say there is nowhere for them to go, with some hospitals shut down and the remaining ones already overcrowded and dangerously short of essential supplies.

The chief spokesman for Israel’s military, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, declined to say how many Israeli troops were inside Gaza, or where, but confirmed that a combined force of infantry and armored units, operating with air support, was engaging in “expanded ground operations,” but was moving gradually. He said Hamas gunmen typically gather at “staging sites” before trying to attack Israeli soldiers, “after which we strike them from the air.”

Overnight, he added, “dozens of terrorists were eliminated” after they barricaded themselves inside buildings and attempted to attack the soldiers who were moving in their direction. It was not possible to verify Israel’s account of the fighting.

Hamas’s armed wing released a video showing three women who were kidnapped on Oct. 7; one of them sharply criticizes Mr. Netanyahu, saying the hostages are being held in “unbearable conditions” and demanding that he exchange them for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

“When I saw Daniel on television, my heart almost stopped,” said Ramos Aloni, the father of Daniel Aloni, one of the hostages in the Hamas video. “My wife and I were shocked, but we also felt relief — she was alive and we were seeing her.”

Mr. Netanyahu has been under pressure from the families of some hostages held in Gaza, who have accused his government of prioritizing the military campaign over the effort to bring back their loved ones. Some have even expressed willingness to consider a deal that would exchange Israel’s Palestinian prisoners for the hostages.

Mr. Netanyahu’s office called the Hamas video “cruel psychological propaganda,” and in his news conference, the prime minister said the invasion of Gaza “actually creates the possibility of getting our hostages out.”

The Israeli military also said it had rescued a woman, a 19-year-old soldier taken hostage in the Hamas incursion and held in Gaza — the first known rescue operation since the mass abduction on Oct. 7 — as its forces continued their ground invasion there.

Conditions are dire for civilians in Gaza, under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade. Forty-seven trucks carrying food, water, medical supplies and other humanitarian aid entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt on Sunday, according to a Palestinian official at the crossing. That was the largest one-day total in the nine days since the shipments began, but less than half of what the United Nations says is needed."

For decades, Hezbollah has been a significant force in Lebanon, wielding both political power and military strength — all while engaging in tit-for-tat skirmishes with its southern enemy, Israel.

What is going on?

Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire almost daily since Oct. 7, when Hamas mounted attacks in Israel that killed 1,400 people, according to the Israeli authorities. With Israel threatening a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, many in the region fear that the fighting with Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, could also escalate into a war involving Lebanon, too. This would leave Israel fighting on two fronts, a situation it wants to avoid.

Israel’s northern border has become increasingly tense: On Monday, the Israeli military said it would evacuate 28 communities near Lebanon, affecting about 10,000 people. At least three Lebanese civilians have died over the past week, including the Reuters journalist, Issam Abdallah. One Israeli civilian has been killed. A number of fighters from Hezbollah and Hamas also have been killed.

Mohamad Srour, the mayor of the Lebanese border town of Aita al-Shaab, has said that Israeli bombings have struck homes, ambulances and a school for people with special needs, leading to injuries. At least 3,650 civilians displaced by the fighting have so far been registered in Tyre, a Lebanese city close to the border with Israel, and in recent days, U.N. peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon have begun to shelter some civilians."

“During these difficult times, it’s more important than ever for New York to show up in support of Israel,” she said in a statement. “New York will show the world that we stand with Israel — today, tomorrow and forever.”

The governor’s impromptu trip, just as Israel prepares for an expected invasion of Gaza, is expected to overlap with President Biden’s own visit to Israel on Wednesday."
128,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/world/middleeast/biden-israel-gaza-hospital.html,"President Biden on Wednesday backed Israel’s contention that a Palestinian group had caused an explosion at a Gaza hospital that killed hundreds of people. He also announced that the Israeli government would allow critically needed aid into the besieged Gaza Strip.

It was not clear whether the statements by Mr. Biden, who was in Tel Aviv, would dampen widespread anger over the war and the carnage on Tuesday at Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, which have prompted widespread anti-Israel protests from Tehran to Rabat, Morocco. Many civilians had taken shelter from Israel’s bombing campaign on the hospital grounds.

Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls Gaza and is battling Israel, blamed an Israeli airstrike without citing evidence — a claim that was widely accepted across the Middle East.

But American officials said evidence from a variety of sources pointed to a failed rocket launch aimed at Israel from within Gaza as the cause of the explosion. That was the conclusion Israeli officials began presenting on Tuesday night."
129,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/opinion/israel-gaza-war.html,"Some lessons probably don’t apply to the current moment at all — particularly the elements of American folly that reflected our universalist overconfidence hyped up by our unique post-Cold War position as a globe-bestriding superpower. In 2003 we imagined ourselves capable of remaking the Middle East and, indeed, the world, on a scale that today’s Israel, a small country set about with enemies, is extremely unlikely to envision.

Other lessons do apply, but not in any simple way. For instance, one basic lesson you could take from America’s post-9/11 disasters is the importance of restraint in moments of maximal emotional trauma, of thinking it through and counting the cost rather than just obeying a do-something imperative.

Among all the various factors that led us into Iraq, one shouldn’t underestimate the impulse that we just hadn’t done something big enough in response to the terror attacks, that the Afghanistan intervention alone wasn’t enough to satisfy our righteous rage or prove our dominance. And you can see this as a temptation for the Israelis now, with the horror so fresh — an impulse to reject anything that smacks of half-measures or limitations, to wave away the risks of civilian casualties or regional chaos, to treat any hesitation as a form of cowardice.

But not every aggressive path America took after 9/11 looks mistaken in hindsight. The long-term debacle of our Afghanistan occupation doesn’t make our initial decision to topple the Taliban unwise. The moral failures of our interrogation program don’t mean that we were wrong to take a generally aggressive posture toward Al Qaeda and its satellites. Setting out to destroy the Islamic State’s caliphate rather than seeking stable coexistence was a correct and successful call.

In each of these cases, the achievement of something relatively basic — preventing terrorist groups from existing in the kind of comfort required to pull off another Sept. 11 — required much more maximalist strategies than, say, the Clinton administration undertook in the 1990s. Reportedly that kind of cruise-missile minimalism is what bin Laden expected from America after Sept. 11 as well. And not only was it a good thing we didn’t give to him; we couldn’t really have avoided escalation. A restraint that allowed for frequent repetitions of Al Qaeda’s 2001 triumph — for mass-casualty terrorism as a consistent fact of American life — would have been politically untenable and would have eventually yielded an even more disproportionate response."
130,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/world/europe/biden-israel-putin-china.html,"As President Biden visited Israel on Wednesday, seeking to display steadfast American support for the country, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was in Beijing, seeking to display his “no limits” partnership with China’s top leader, Xi Jinping.

The two contrasting trips show how vastly the global political landscape has been redrawn by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and how that changed landscape is on full display in the war in Gaza.

Russia, China and Iran were already forming a new axis over Ukraine, one they have pursued diplomatically, economically, strategically and even ideologically. Russia relies on weapons from Iran and diplomatic support from China to fight in Ukraine. Iran has been isolated and only too happy to have new trading partners and some source of international legitimacy. China, whose economy is ailing, has saved billions of dollars by importing record amounts of oil from countries under Western sanctions, like Russia and Iran.

Together, they find a common ideological cause in denouncing and defying the United States in the name of reforming the existing international order dominated by the West since World War II."
131,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-war-russia-exiles.html,"Days after Russia invaded Ukraine last year, Matvey Kukuy, a technology entrepreneur, fled the country for Israel, more out of shame than fear. But when Hamas attacked his new home two weeks ago, he did the opposite: While at a conference in Portugal, he booked tickets to go back to Israel in one of its greatest moments of crisis.

“I felt I was on the right side of history this time,” Mr. Kukuy, 30, said in a phone interview from Tel Aviv.

Mr. Kukuy, who is from Moscow, was one of thousands of Russians with Jewish heritage, including many prominent figures, who left for Israel after the invasion of Ukraine. Some stood in lines in front of Israeli diplomatic missions in Moscow, some sought to prove their Jewish roots inside Israel. To resettle in Israel, Russians need to show that one adult family member has Jewish heritage.

In the early weeks of 2022, when a Russian invasion of Ukraine seemed imminent, a steady stream of people left Russia. That turned into a flood of such proportions after the war started that Russian prosecutors soon sought to impose an operational ban on a major Jewish nonprofit agency that helps people emigrate to Israel. A Russian court has yet to rule on the matter.

The exodus of Russian families and Israel’s decision not to endorse the Kremlin’s rationale for the war — the false assertion that Ukraine is run by Nazis — strained the relationship between the two countries.

But it also highlighted the deep divisions within Russian society over President Vladimir V. Putin’s decision to attack Ukraine. Thousands opposed to the war no longer live in Russia. Others — with their voices amplified by the country’s state-run media — labeled the exiles as treacherous traitors who should never return to Russia.

The war between Israel and Hamas, the armed group that controls Gaza, exposed the fact that these divisions are deep and enduring.

Lev Sotnikov left Russia shortly after Mr. Putin announced a call-up of reservists to join the fighting in September 2022. He said that while all wars carry some similarities, the one between Israel and Hamas is different from the one in Ukraine because, unlike Russia, Israel is “fighting for its survival as a state.”

This war was also a crash course for him on life in the country, said Mr. Sotnikov, 37. This summer, after he settled with his family in the town of Nahariya, six miles from the border with Lebanon, he felt “absolutely safe,” he said.

Since the attack by Hamas, tensions have flared in the north near Lebanon, with some analysts and officials fearing an escalation of hostilities in the area.

“Now I understand that even when everything will end,” Mr. Sotnikov said, referring to the current war between Israel and Hamas, “nothing will actually end.”

After Hamas’s attack, many Russian families decided to leave Israel, at least for the initial period of open hostilities. Russian aviation authorities said on Friday that around 7,000 people had flown from Israel to Russia after the attack by Hamas and that around 3,000 had flown back. Russian community chats in some of the main centers of postwar immigration, such as Tbilisi, Georgia, or Yerevan, Armenia, were filled with requests for temporary apartments and other help.

Some Russian exiles in Israel said they were surprised that, despite deep political divisions, there was a consensus among Israelis about the need to help each other and their army.

Yuri Podkopayev, a math teacher who left Russia last November, said that unlike in Russia, in Israel people were free to criticize the government but that they were also all united around one cause — the protection of their country.

“No one questioned Russia’s right for existence,” said Mr. Podkopayev, 40. “That’s why there wasn’t any kind of massive support of the war in Ukraine.”

However, even exiles against the Kremlin’s war still see Russia as their motherland, they said. While Mr. Podkopayev has settled in Israel for good and is learning Hebrew so he can resume teaching math, he said that he considers himself to be a patriot of both Russia and Israel.

“I have two countries, and I worry about both of them,” Mr. Podkopayev said. “One of them is just seriously sick now.”"
132,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/opinion/israel-hamas-hostage.html,"Israelis have been held hostage many times over the nation’s 75 years. In May 1974, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine held 115 hostages, most of them high school students in the town of Maalot, in northern Israel, for two days, an episode that ended in the murders of 22 hostages. An Air Force officer, Ron Arad, was shot down over Lebanon in 1986 and was never returned. In May 1985, Israel released 1,150 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the return of three Israeli soldiers captured in Lebanon.

Over the course of those painful episodes, the nation learned a great deal about how to work for its hostages’ release, whether through third-party negotiations, secret back channels or force. But today’s hostage crisis is unlike any other. It’s not just a few people being held by hostile forces. It’s about 200 people, including women, children and the elderly, and it’s unfolding in the midst of a full-blown war. None of the old rules apply.

Hamas held Mr. Shalit in a secret location. Is that possible with such a large group? Gaza is a very small territory with a very dense population, not all of whom support Hamas. The inevitable intelligence leaks could enable Israel to conduct rescue operations. Israeli intelligence analysts will be looking for leads anywhere they can find them, such as data from cellphones found on the bodies of terrorists killed since the attack on Oct. 7.

It is equally unclear how this group of hostages will be treated. Hamas treated Mr. Shalit surprisingly well during his years of captivity. He was never physically tortured. Could the same be the case with so many hostages? Hamas has said that some of them are being held by other groups, including Islamic Jihad. Whatever Hamas’s approach is toward these hostages, there is no guarantee that another group will share it.

Killing hostages is not what I would previously have expected from Hamas. But the killing spree of Oct. 7, including the butchering of whole families, the burning of homes, the destruction of whole communities, changed that. On Monday, it released a video of a 21-year-old hostage who appeared to have been wounded and was being treated on camera. There were no signs that she had been tortured but it was clear that she was under duress.

Negotiating for the release of hostages may also be less popular this time around. The Shalit deal was very difficult for Israel to accept. More than 300 of the Palestinians who were released from prison had been serving life sentences for violent acts, including killing Israelis. It was hard for me, too: My wife’s first cousin, Sasson Nuriel, was kidnapped and killed by Hamas in September 2005. Four of the people responsible for murdering him were released as part of the agreement that I negotiated. Still, in the end, nearly 80 percent of the public, according to one poll, along with 26 government ministers and the entire national security establishment, supported the deal. Prime Minister Netanyahu signed off on the agreement.

Today, Israel holds about 7,000 Palestinian prisoners, of whom 559 are serving life sentences for killing Israelis, according to Addameer, a Palestinian prisoners’ rights group. Will Israelis, still reeling from the atrocities of Oct. 7, be willing to accept this kind of bargain again? Is it safe to do so? One of the men who killed my wife’s cousin, who was released in exchange for Mr. Shalit, was among the leaders of the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, according to Israel’s report of his recent killing.

I have no official authorization as a negotiator, but as far as I know, I’m the only Israeli citizen who has contacts both with the leadership of Hamas and the leadership of Israel, so I have been in continual touch with both sides in hopes of advancing some long-term agreement. The release of those first two hostages is a positive development, but overall, prospects remain dim. Hamas continues to demand an end to “Israel’s aggression against Gaza,” and Israel says it has no intention of ending this war “until the job is done.” Mr. Hamad has not backed down from Hamas’s brutal attacks.

In my conversations with Hamas leaders, I have pushed them to release the women, children, elderly and sick as a humanitarian gesture. Hamas rejected the idea. I believe that Israel is open to accepting a small deal in exchange for such a group, so I proposed to my Hamas contacts that they trade them for the 33 Palestinian women and 170 Palestinian minors currently in Israeli prisons, according to Addameer. Hamas rejected that, too. Right now, Hamas’s focus is achieving a comprehensive cease-fire.

There are still official talks taking place. Qatar is speaking with Hamas and the United States is speaking with Qatar and Israel. This is too convoluted and complex. There need to be direct talks among Israel, Qatar and Hamas and no one else. Not the United States and not Iran. The agreement of Hamas to release the two Americans was apparently negotiated by the Qataris and assisted by the International Committee of the Red Cross.

The United States still has a role to play. It should continue to pressure Qatar, which should give an ultimatum that if hostages are not released within, say, 24 hours, all of Hamas’s leaders will be expelled from Qatar, where many are based. I don’t believe that Qatar will agree to that — and certainly not without an Israeli cease-fire — but the American government and others have leverage over Qatar and it should be used.

There is still a small chance and a limited window of opportunity before the ground assault begins to attain the release of some of the hostages through this kind of agreement. After the invasion begins, it will depend on Israeli special forces to try to save them.

Some will again see their homes; others may not.

At the other end of this war, I hope that the trauma and suffering we are all feeling on both sides of the conflict will spur us to figure out how to share this land that belongs to both Israelis and Palestinians. Maybe our collective suffering and pain can be channeled to focusing on how to live together rather than killing each other. That will be a long process and cannot include the leaders on both sides who have brought us to where we are.

We need a new generation of leaders with new vision, new hopes, new dreams and the ability to lead. I hope that many of the hostages, together with their families, will soon be able to join the voices calling for change."
133,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/us/politics/gazas-tunnels-israel-ground-war.html,"Just after midnight on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces announced that they had struck a tunnel that allowed Hamas to “infiltrate Israel through the sea.”

The sea tunnel was unusual, a sign that Hamas has designed deadly new ways to attack Israel. The armed group has miles of tunnels under the Gaza Strip — a U.S. official likened them to “miniature cities” — but the exit to this one was on a beach.

Among the possible reasons Israel delayed sending troops into Gaza after the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, one stands out, military experts say: the tunnels.

Underneath the tiny coastal strip and its more than 2 million people is a vast network of subterranean pathways, rooms, cells and even roads for vehicles. Hamas, which oversees Gaza, is believed to hide weapons, fighters and even command centers in the warren of underground chambers.

Overnight on Saturday, Israeli fighter planes struck 150 underground targets in the northern Gaza Strip, the Israeli military said.

For the Israeli forces who take part in any large-scale ground invasion, one of the most daunting challenges will be the tunnels, which Hamas has spent years refining. For the people who live above the tunnels, one of the most frightening propositions will be how to survive the subterranean warfare."

A fitness instructor, aged 26, she was drawn to trance music festivals as a means, she said, “to disconnect your mind from all the tension in Israel.” The Tribe of Nova gathering, celebrating the Jewish holiday of Sukkot amid groves of eucalyptus trees only three miles from Gaza, seemed particularly well organized, so the fireworks struck her as no more than an extravagant flourish.

Her fellow bartender, whom she had met just hours before, turned to her: “I don’t think those are fireworks.”

They were, in fact, the white flashes of Hamas rockets from Gaza, the fire at dawn signaling an attack that would turn fields full of young Israelis dancing to psychedelic music into a slaughterhouse. In this massacre of its youth, Israel’s 75-year-old quest for some carefree normalcy met the murderous fury of those long-oppressed Palestinians who deny the state’s right to exist."

The trip by Mr. Biden — announced by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken early Tuesday morning in Tel Aviv, on the eve of a potential escalation of the conflict in the Middle East — will be a remarkable gamble less than two weeks after the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks that killed more than 1,400 people in southern Israel.

His acceptance of the Israeli invitation by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demonstrates American solidarity with Israel, signaling to its rivals like Iran, Syria and Hezbollah that it has the power of the United States behind it at a time of increasing anxiety about a regional war. But it also ties Mr. Biden, and the United States, to the bloodshed in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, the group that attacked Israel.

Airstrikes that Israel says target Hamas forces have killed more than 2,808 people and wounded 10,850 others in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes. And an Israeli siege has caused shortages of food, water and fuel, drawing warnings from the United Nations of a humanitarian calamity."

The screen showed a live map of northern Gaza, the densely populated area of roughly 1.1 million residents who were told on Friday by the Israeli military to head south for their own safety. Using data harvested mainly from more than one million mobile phones, the map gave the soldiers a real-time assessment of how many Gazans had heeded Israel’s demand.

The Israel Defense Forces have telegraphed for days that they will soon begin a ground operation in northern Gaza to oust Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that controls Gaza and orchestrated the worst terrorist attacks in Israel’s history on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,400 people and abducting at least 199 others. Israeli counterattacks have killed more than 2,800 Palestinians, according to the Gazan health authorities.

The resolution had the support of the majority of the Council members and had been expected to be adopted. The U.S. veto generated criticism of American double standards and accusations that the United States, which had criticized Russia for paralyzing the Council on the war in Ukraine, was impeding the work of the Council. But the American ambassador said the U.S. couldn’t support the resolution without a mention of Israel’s right to self-defense.

Brazil, which holds the rotating presidency of the Council this month, had put forth the resolution, which called for humanitarian access and protection of civilians in Gaza, the immediate release of Israeli hostages and condemned Hamas’s terrorist attack on Israel.

The ambassador from the United Arab Emirates, Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, said the resolution may not have been perfect but that it clearly stated “basic principles” that the Council “is obliged to reinforce and uphold.”

Brazil’s ambassador, Sérgio França Danese, said the resolution’s failure was “very sad” and that silence and inaction from the Council did not serve anyone’s interests, especially Palestinians in Gaza, who, she said, “cannot wait any longer.”

The United States was the only no vote, but as the holder of a permanent seat on the Council, its vote carried veto power. Two other permanent members, Russia and Britain, abstained, and the two others — France and China — joined with the remaining 10 Council members, including the United Arab Emirates, in voting for passage.

A day earlier, a resolution from Russia on the war that condemned violence against civilians but did not mention Hamas failed to garner the nine required votes.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the ambassador from the United States, said that the latest resolution, which would have been legally binding, could hamper President Biden’s diplomatic efforts. She was speaking on the eve of his whirlwind visit to Israel. To the Council, she said that the United States “is disappointed this resolution made no mention of Israel’s right of self-defense.”

The Security Council has struggled to respond to Hamas’s terrorist attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, which killed more than 1,400 people and left nearly 200 others as hostages. Israel has replied with retaliatory strikes on Gaza, killing more than 3,000 Palestinians and injuring more than 9,000, including nearly 1,000 children, according to the U.N.

The Israeli ambassador, Gilad Erdan, and the Palestinian representative at the U.N., Riyad Mansour, both said the Council had failed them.

Mr. Erdan said he was unable to fathom how the Council could fail to collectively condemn Hamas’s terrorist attacks. “Calling for calm, restraint and cease-fire is like putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound,” he said. “Such steps would not eradicate the cancer that is Hamas.”

Mr. Mansour called on the Council to demand an immediate cease-fire. “The Security Council of the United Nations is unable to say the one thing that truly matters: stop the bloodshed,” he said.

The U.N.’s special coordinator for the Israel-Palestine peace process said the organization was engaging with all sides to open a humanitarian channel from the Rafah border in Egypt where convoys carrying aid have lined up.

“I fear that we are at the brink of a deep and dangerous abyss that could change the trajectory of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, if not of the Middle East as a whole,” said the official, Tor Wennesland."

President Biden is considering a trip to Israel in the coming days to demonstrate American solidarity. The trip would be a remarkable gamble and could tie Biden and the U.S. to bloodshed in Gaza.

The extraordinary invitation to Biden from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came as Israelis learned more about the attacks by Hamas that killed more than 1,400 people on Oct. 7. The Israeli military now believes the group took 199 people hostage, it said, nearly 50 more than previously thought.

“This will be a long war,” Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said after meeting with Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, in Tel Aviv. “The price will be high, but we are going to win for Israel, for the Jewish people and for the values that both countries believe in.”

The following is a transcript of his remarks, as recorded by The New York Times.

Good evening, my fellow Americans.

We’re facing an inflection point in history. One of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come. That’s what I’d like to talk with you about tonight.

Now earlier this morning I returned from Israel. They tell me I’m the first American president to travel there during a war. I met with the prime minister and members of his cabinet, and most movingly, I met with Israelis who had personally lived through the horrific horror of the attack by Hamas on the 7th of October. More than 1,300 people slaughtered in Israel, including at least 32 American citizens. Scores of innocents from infants to the elderly, grandparents, Israelis, Americans taken hostage. As I told the families of Americans being held captive by Hamas, we’re pursuing every avenue to bring their loved ones home. As president, there is no higher priority for me than the safety of Americans held hostage.

The terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure unadulterated evil in the world, but sadly, the Jewish people know, perhaps better than anyone, that there is no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on others.

In Israel, I saw a people who are strong, determined, resilient and also angry, in shock and in deep, deep pain. I also spoke with President Abbas, the Palestinian Authority, and reiterated that the United States remains committed to the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and to self-determination. The actions of Hamas terrorists don’t take that right away.

Like so many others, I’m heartbroken by the tragic loss of Palestinian life, including the explosion at the hospital in Gaza, which was not done by the Israelis. We mourn every innocent life lost. We can’t ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians who only want to live in peace and have an opportunity."

As long as the United States stands and we will stand forever, we will not let you ever be alone. You can’t look at what has happened here to your mothers, your fathers, your grandparents, sons, daughters, children, even babies, and not scream out for justice. Justice must be done. But I caution this while you feel that rage, don’t be consumed by it. After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes. I’m the first U.S. President to visit Israel in time of war. I’ve made wartime decisions. I know the choices are never clear or easy for the leadership. There’s always cost. But it requires being deliberate. It requires asking very hard questions. When we’re faced with tragedy and loss, we must go back to the beginning to remember who we are. We are all human beings created in the image of God with dignity, humanity and purpose. In the darkness to be the light unto the world is what we’re about. You inspire hope and light for so many around the world. That’s what the terrorists seek to destroy. That’s what they seek to destroy because they live in darkness. But not you. Not Israel. Nations of conscience like the United States and Israel are not measured solely by the example of their power. We’re measured by the power of our example."
141,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-military-incursion.html,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised news conference on Saturday that Israel’s forces had entered the Gaza Strip, calling it his country’s “second war of independence” and warning Israelis to expect a “long and difficult” campaign to eradicate Hamas.

Mr. Netanyahu said the troops had gone into Gaza on Friday evening, beginning “the second stage of the war.” The Israeli military has not publicly described the current operation as an invasion, and has released only brief footage of its advance.

The ground assault in the northern part of the Gaza Strip was shrouded in secrecy and ambiguity and accompanied by an enormous aerial and artillery bombardment. It was the most sustained fighting against Hamas since the war began three weeks ago, when gunmen from the group that controls Gaza launched a surprise cross-border attack into Israel on Oct. 7, killing at least 1,400 people and spurring retaliatory airstrikes by Israel in the Gaza Strip.

Hamas’s armed wing confirmed on Friday night and Saturday afternoon that the battle with Israeli ground forces had been joined. Shortly before Mr. Netanyahu’s remarks, a spokesman for the group, Abu Obeida, greeted the relentless airstrikes and the ground incursion with defiance. Hamas would make Israel “taste new ways of death,” the spokesman said.

With Gazan internet connections and phone lines down, few Palestinian accounts have emerged, making it difficult to assess the extent of the military action.

Palestinian telecommunication companies blamed Israel’s bombardment for the wide-scale communications blackout, which left most people in Gaza unreachable by phone. The blackout sparked fear and panic, according to residents who were able to reach the outside world, as people struggled to get information or check on family and friends.

“The explosions were happening to our left, to our right — from all directions,” Helmi Mousa, a Gaza City resident who huddled with his wife in their ninth-floor apartment, said on Saturday. The bombardments were so intense overnight, he said, that even amid a sustained electricity blackout, their apartment was filled with the light of explosions.

“Our building was shaking, swaying back and forth,” added Mr. Mousa, who was reached on his foreign-registered cellular phone, one of the few connections still working. “We could hear the booms, the airplanes, the strikes.”"
142,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/us/politics/republican-jewish-coalition-israel.html,"A series of speeches by Republican presidential candidates on Saturday to a large gathering of Jewish donors and activists demonstrated how the escalating conflict in the Middle East has elevated foreign policy into a dominant campaign issue and exposed fresh divides within the primary contest.

Nikki Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations, attacked former President Donald J. Trump as “confused” on the threats facing the United States and Israel. Mr. Trump promised to fight the “jihadists, the terrorists, the Marxists” abroad and at home. And Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida denounced the “false moral equivalency” between Hamas and Israeli deaths.

The remarks to the Republican Jewish Coalition, set in a sprawling convention center at the Venetian in Las Vegas, took place as Israel expanded its ground operations in Gaza, and at a critical moment for the primary contest. With Mr. Trump far ahead in the polls, time is growing short for his challengers to distinguish themselves. And Ms. Haley and his other rivals see new opportunities in his clumsy response to attacks in Ukraine and Israel, which threaten to expand into broader regional conflicts.

Mr. Trump, who spoke last, ignored the other candidates during his remarks, focusing squarely on attacking President Biden as weak, while arguing that the world would be safer if he were still in the White House.

“If I were president, the attack on Israel would never ever have happened,” he told the 1,500 attendees who packed the ballroom. “I think you believe that. Ukraine would never have happened. Inflation would have never happened.”

Mr. Trump struck the most militaristic tone of the speakers, warning attendees of threats from “a lot of young strong men” entering the country who are the “same people that attacked Israel.” And he praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the neo-authoritarian leader who is admired by far-right nationalists in the United States and Europe and who has been accused of employing antisemitic tropes for political gain.

In his remarks, Mr. Trump cast himself in a similar vein as Mr. Orban — a “very strong man,” he said — promising to keep the country safe with threats of force.

“If you spill a drop of American blood, we will spill a gallon of yours,” he said, arguing that the world had become less safe under the leadership of Mr. Biden. “I will defend America, and I will defend Western civilization from the barbarians and savages and fascists that you see now trying to do harm to our beautiful Israel.”

Mr. Trump did not comment on the departure from the race of his former vice president, Mike Pence, who had announced he was ending his presidential bid before Mr. Trump took the stage. In the final speech of his campaign, Mr. Pence warned his party against adopting an isolationist foreign policy — like the policies put forward by Vivek Ramaswamy, who preceded him on the stage.

The annual meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition was perhaps the highest-profile gathering of the fall Republican primary season, taking on greater urgency after Hamas’s attack on Israel three weeks ago. Last week, the organization was added as a sponsor of the third Republican debate, a reflection of how Israel unified a broad coalition of party voters and officials, including foreign policy hawks, business leaders and evangelical Christians.

It is also a galvanizing moment for Republican officials: In a last-minute pivot, the event’s schedule changed to accommodate the first national appearance by the newly elected House speaker, Mike Johnson, who addressed the group on Saturday night.

“We are going to stand like a rock with our friend and our ally Israel,” said Mr. Johnson, an evangelical Christian who noted how his faith led him to support the nation. “As a Christian, I know, and we believe, the Bible teaches very clearly that we’re to stand with Israel.”

Ms. Haley used her address to launch some of the most scathing attacks of her 2024 primary race, questioning Mr. Trump’s capacity to manage the foreign affairs of a country facing multiple military entanglements abroad. She highlighted remarks by the former president criticizing Israeli intelligence and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as weak just days after the attack.

“As president, I will not compliment Hezbollah. Nor will I criticize Israel’s prime minister in the middle of tragedy and war. We have no time for personal vendettas,” she told the crowd of donors, activists and officials. “With all due respect, I don’t get confused.”

Ms. Haley, known for her staunch support of Israel as Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, has been climbing in the polls after two strong debate performances.

“Eight years ago, it was good to have a leader who broke things. But right now, we need a leader who also knows how to put things back together,” she said. “America needs a captain who will steady the ship, not capsize it. And Republicans need a candidate who can actually win.”

All eight candidates who appeared offered their strong support for Israel, pledging to back the military operations and fight against rising antisemitic threats at home, particularly on college campuses.

Of all the candidates, only Mr. Ramaswamy qualified his support, signaling that he would be less inclined to provide military support to Israelis for the escalating conflict. The entrepreneur and author tried to win over the crowd, entering to the music of Matisyahu, an observant Jewish hip-hop artist, reciting a line of a Jewish prayer in Hebrew and quoting liberally from David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister of Israel.

In his address, which involved a meandering recounting of modern Israeli military history, Mr. Ramaswamy attempted to recast a more isolationist stance as supportive of Israel’s right to self-defense.

“If Israel wants to destroy Hamas, it should go ahead and destroy Hamas,” he said. “But these are decisions for Israel to make, not America. I am not running for president of Israel. I am running for president of the United States.”

Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey who has for months been Mr. Trump’s chief antagonist on the campaign trail, struck a more somber tone in his remarks, saying “this is too serious a moment for pettiness.”

Mr. Christie and Mr. Ramaswamy were the only candidates whose speeches were met with resounding boos, though from different corners of the audience: Mr. Christie has been a target of Trump supporters, and Mr. Ramaswamy has been widely criticized for his hesitation to provide military support.

Mr. Trump entered Saturday’s event as the crowd favorite, beloved for his record on Israel as president, which included moving the American embassy to Jerusalem and signing the Abraham Accords, an agreement normalizing relations between Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. He also cut aid for Palestinians, and his administration took steps to designate a campaign to boycott Israel as antisemitic.

But his criticism of Israeli intelligence and Mr. Netanyahu as weak, and his description of Hezbollah attackers as “very smart,” has invited attacks from his rivals.

Amid the expression of concern and solidarity for one of America’s closest allies, Republican politicians saw political opportunities in the divisions that the conflict has opened up at home.

Several of the speakers on Saturday disparaged progressive Democratic lawmakers, particularly Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, whose names drew loud boos from the audience. Others spoke about the tensions on college campuses, where students have clashed over the war.

“Progressives say they’re all about the safety and feelings of minorities, the oppressed, the marginalized,” said Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina. “But when it comes to Jewish Americans who are hurting — they are silent.”"

Amid our coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, two recent episodes of “The Daily” stood out, connecting listeners to the raw personal testimony of civilians. They included a father of four who survived at the center of Hamas’s brutal attack on Israelis, and two Gaza residents who shared accounts of the chaos and fear there. Beyond this coverage from the ground, Ezra Klein’s audio essay, with lessons for Israel from the American response to the Sept. 11 attacks, was just one textured and nuanced example of the range of perspectives we have featured.

144,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/world/middleeast/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-gaza.html,"One motivation for the Biden administration’s bringing the aircraft carriers closer to Israel is to try to convince Hezbollah to stay out of the fighting to avoid any possible intervention by the United States.

Changes in the Middle East in recent years have made it more likely that violence in one place could ignite violence elsewhere. That’s because Iran has worked to knit anti-Israel forces in different countries into an increasingly tight web.

Armed groups in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen that once largely fought separately now see themselves as being on the same team. Many of their commanders have received similar training from Iran or Hezbollah and their members share knowledge on how to increase the firepower of rockets and to surveil their enemies with drones.

Iran may lead the network, but Hezbollah, which was formed in Lebanon by the Islamic Republic more than three decades ago, is the primary enforcer. Its members played a key role in helping Syria turn the tide against anti-government rebels during the country’s civil war, which began in 2011. And its operatives have increased the fighting abilities of pro-Iranian militias in Iraq and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Israel, the United States and other countries have designated Hezbollah and some of its regional partners, including Hamas in Gaza, as terrorist organizations.

Israel has viewed Hezbollah as its most formidable foe since they fought to a standstill in a monthlong war in 2006 that killed more than 1,000 Lebanese and 165 Israelis. Hezbollah’s members are highly trained, have an arsenal of tens of thousands of rockets and possess precision-guided missiles that can pummel targets deep in Israeli territory."

But some in her family could not get out in time.

“The Israelis bombed the house over the heads of my father-in-law and his wife and their children,” said the 48-year-old homeopathic clinician. “My husband and his brothers couldn’t get them out.”

As Israel continues its bombardment of Gaza in retaliation for the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on southern Israel that killed more than 1,400 people, the territory’s rescue crews are struggling to save the wounded and recover the bodies. Their work is both difficult and dangerous."
146,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/15/us/politics/biden-israel-gaza.html,"President Biden warned Israel in an interview aired on Sunday not to reoccupy Gaza, his first significant public effort to restrain America’s ally in the wake of the Hamas assault that killed more than 1,300 people, including at least 29 Americans.

Mr. Biden has offered staunch support for Israel since the Oct. 7 attack and refused to criticize Israel for its retaliatory siege of Gaza, the coastal enclave controlled by Hamas, even as U.N. officials have warned of a humanitarian crisis there. But in the new interview, he cautioned against a full-scale occupation of Gaza.

“I think it’d be a big mistake,” Mr. Biden told “60 Minutes” on CBS in a conversation taped on Thursday and aired on Sunday night. “Look, what happened in Gaza, in my view, is Hamas and the extreme elements of Hamas don’t represent all the Palestinian people. And I think that it would be a mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza again.” But “taking out the extremists” there, he added, “is a necessary requirement.”

The president’s comments came as he was considering whether to visit Israel in the coming days to demonstrate solidarity with Israelis still reeling from the Hamas attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu extended the invitation to the president over the weekend, according to an administration official, confirming a report on Israeli television, but Mr. Biden has not decided yet whether to go at this time."
147,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/us/politics/biden-israel-hamas-democrats.html,"When President Biden delivers a prime-time Oval Office address on Thursday about the wars in Israel and Ukraine, it will be his third major speech on the Mideast conflict as he grapples with a fragile Democratic coalition that is closely watching how he handles the outbreak of violence.

In his remarks last week and again on Wednesday in Tel Aviv, Mr. Biden sought to put no daylight between the United States and Israel — though in his second speech, he warned the Israelis not to “be consumed” by their rage about the Hamas attack this month that killed more than 1,400 people. He pleaded with the Israelis not to overreact, as he said the United States did after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.

Mr. Biden’s speech comes as his political coalition has begun to fray over the Israeli conflict. Progressives and young Democrats are demanding that he press Israel to stop its incursion on Gaza, while more centrist Democrats who make up the core of his political base were nearly unanimous in their praise of his Tel Aviv speech.

“I am grateful to have @POTUS thoughtful leadership in this moment,” Representative Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri wrote on social media. “As we continue working save the lives of hostages and hold Hamas accountable, I encourage him to continue using his platform to call for restraint and the protection of innocent Israelis and Palestinians alike.”

Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland said Mr. Biden “speaks for me and speaks for all of America” on Israel. And Richard Haass, the former chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, called the Wednesday speech “nothing less than masterful.”

And while Biden campaign officials insist they aren’t planning to use the Israel trip as campaign fodder, Representative Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts forecast what could become the sort of contrast the president’s aides and allies make with former President Donald J. Trump should he win the Republican presidential nomination.

“Joe Biden flew into a war zone to stand with Israel,” Mr. Auchincloss said late Wednesday. “Trump wouldn’t even visit a cemetery of American war dead.” (Mr. Trump, in 2018, canceled a planned trip to a French cemetery, and his aides cited the rainy weather.)

Liberal Democrats who have been critical of how Mr. Biden has tethered the White House to Israel as the Israelis carry out attacks on the Gaza Strip focused their attention Wednesday on amplifying attention on antiwar demonstrators who marched around the Capitol and renewed their calls for a cease-fire.

“We cannot bomb our way to peace,” wrote Representative Cori Bush of Missouri. “We need a cease-fire,” said Representative André Carson of Indiana. And several left-wing members of Congress reposted a message from Pope Francis in which he called the situation in Gaza “desperate” and pleaded that “the weapons be silenced; let the cry for peace be heard from the poor, from the people, from the children!”

Some used especially heated language: Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, speaking outside the Capitol, said, “We are literally watching people commit genocide and killing a vast majority, just like this, and we still stand by and say nothing.”

Some Democrats began attacking their party colleagues who are skeptical of the Israeli war effort. Representative Jerry Nadler of New York condemned the organization behind the Capitol protest, and Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida told Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota that “you have been training your outrage on the wrong party” after Ms. Omar reiterated her call for Mr. Biden to seek a cease-fire.

Progressive activists circulated a video of Dilawar Syed, a deputy administrator of the Small Business Administration, being booed while speaking at a vigil for Wadea Al-Fayoume, the 6-year-old Palestinian boy from the Chicago suburbs who was killed in what prosecutors said was an attack motivated by hate for Muslims amid the fighting in Israel and Gaza.

Another meme circulating on left-wing social media showed a stylized Mr. Biden behind the wheel of a convertible with the caption “Genocidin’ with Biden.”

And Josh Paul, a career State Department official, announced his resignation because of the Biden administration’s “blind support for one side,” which he said was leading to policy decisions that were “shortsighted, destructive, unjust and contradictory to the very values we publicly espouse.”"
148,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/arts/92ny-pauses-season-israel-hamas-war.html,"92NY, one of the city’s leading cultural organizations, announced Monday that it was putting its prestigious literary reading series on pause, following an outcry over its decision to cancel an appearance last week by a prominent writer who had been critical of Israel.

The controversy started on Friday afternoon when 92NY, formerly known as the 92nd Street Y, decided to pull an event that evening featuring the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen, who had planned to discuss his memoir. The reading, organized by 92NY’s Unterberg Poetry Center, instead moved to a bookstore in downtown Manhattan, without any sponsorship from the Y.

92NY confirmed afterward that the decision not to go ahead with the event stemmed from Nguyen’s public statements about Israel.

The decision drew criticism from advocates for free expression. And over the weekend, a number of writers scheduled to appear at 92NY in the coming months announced their intentions to pull out, and some members of the poetry center’s staff resigned.

On Monday afternoon, 92NY said that the 2023-24 literary series was “on pause given recent staff resignations.”

92NY, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year, was founded as the Young Men’s Hebrew Association, with the mission of serving “the social and spiritual needs of the American Jewish community,” according to its website. In the 20th century, it transformed into the 92nd Street Y, a culture and arts organization widely known to New Yorkers as “the Y.” Last year, as it began a $200 million renovation, it rebranded itself as “92NY.”

In a statement on Saturday about calling off Nguyen’s event, the Y said the decision was made was out of concern with Nguyen’s criticisms of Israel.

“We are a Jewish institution that has always welcomed people with diverse viewpoints to our stage,” the statement said. “The brutal Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel and the continued holding of hostages, including senior citizens and young children, has absolutely devastated the community. Given the public comments by the invited author on Israel and this moment, we felt the responsible course of action was to postpone the event while we take some time to determine how best to use our platform and support the entire 92NY community.”

The Y’s Unterberg Poetry Center, founded in 1939, has long been one of the city’s most storied literary venues, with a roster of speakers which has included Dylan Thomas, Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Philip Roth, Salman Rushdie and Toni Morrison.

Before the season was paused, upcoming events included appearances by Richard Ford, John Edgar Wideman and Roxane Gay, as well as an event on Thursday featuring two former United States poet laureates, organized in conjunction with the Academy of American Poets.

On Saturday, as news of the cancellation of Nguyen’s event spread, writers began announcing they would withdraw from upcoming appearances. The critics Christina Sharpe and Saidiya Hartman and the poet and novelist Dionne Brand said they would not appear at an event on Wednesday called “Writing, Form and Black Life.”

“As writers of conscience, as anti-imperialist, anti-racist and anti-colonial thinkers, we have cancelled our appearance,” they said in a joint statement posted on Sharpe’s account on X, formerly Twitter.

The poet Paisley Rekdal and the critic Andrea Long Chu also wrote on X that they were pulling out of their events.

“I am aware of the very difficult position that the Y is in, and I’m deeply sympathetic to it,” Rekdal said in an email on Monday. “However, the Y’s decision has unintentional knock-on effects for the writing community as a whole, in particular an implicit chilling effect on free speech.”

Chu, in her social media announcement, called 92NY a “pro-war nonprofit.” In an email, Chu said the organization had the right to invite or disinvite who it pleased.

“I don’t judge the Y for being political,” she said. “I judge it on the substance of its politics, which I find horrific.”

Meanwhile, Sarah Chihaya, the poetry center’s director, and Sophie Herron, the senior program coordinator, confirmed they had resigned, but declined to comment further.

The turmoil at the Y is part of continuing cultural repercussions over the war between Israel and Hamas. In the arts world, there have been numerous open letters criticizing Israel’s bombardment of Gaza and broader policies toward Palestinians. Some of those letters have in turn prompted counter-letters criticizing what the signatories see as the minimizing, or even the endorsement, of the surprise attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7 that killed some 1,400 people, most of them civilians.

Nguyen, whose novel “The Sympathizer” won the Pulitzer Prize in 2016, was among more than 750 artists who signed an open letter in The London Review of Books calling for an immediate cease-fire, and charging that Israel’s “unprecedented and indiscriminate violence” in Gaza constituted “grave crimes against humanity.” On Instagram, Nguyen also reiterated his support for the movement calling for boycotting, divesting from and sanctioning Israel, known as B.D.S.

His appearance at 92NY, which was to feature him in conversation with the novelist Min Jin Lee, was pulled at around 2 p.m. on Friday, six hours before it was supposed to start. It was held instead, without any sponsorship from the Y, at a McNally Jackson bookstore in Lower Manhattan.

At that event, Bernard Schwartz, the poetry center’s executive director, called 92NY’s decision “unacceptable.”

“What other events will the Y say can no longer happen on its stages?” he asked. When contacted on Monday, Schwartz declined to comment further."
149,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-israel-us-invasion.html,"An invasion could also fuel unrest in neighboring countries and could be particularly destabilizing for governments already struggling to contain discontent over economic pain or political repression, such as Bahrain, Egypt and Jordan.

Iran has long backed Hamas, and Iran-backed regional militias hostile to Israel have threatened to open new fronts in the war, depending on Israel’s military response. Saudi Arabia is a potential target.

Since the war began, Saudi officials have returned to specific calls for a substantive Israeli-Palestinian peace process and for the creation of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.

“If we are not willing to overcome all of the difficulties, all of the challenges, all of the history that is involved in this issue, then we will never have a real peace and security in the region,” Prince Faisal bin Farhan, the Saudi foreign minister, told reporters this week.

Despite the escalating violence, it appears that American and Saudi officials are holding on to hopes of a normalization deal with Israel.

Without that formal step, the limited ties that exist between the two countries — separated by a 22-mile drive through Jordan — have remained largely clandestine.

Senators said they left Riyadh with the impression that Saudi leaders would still like to recognize Israel when the right moment arrives.

American and Israeli officials often frame normalization as a way to help contain Iran.

Iran is Saudi Arabia’s most prominent regional rival. Prince Mohammed launched a disastrous Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen in 2015 aiming to oust the Iran-backed Houthi rebels who nonetheless remain firmly in power there.

But the crown prince, racing to diversify the kingdom’s oil-dependent economy, has recently pursued a less aggressive approach and sought to build bridges. Earlier this year, he re-established diplomatic ties with Iran. Mr. Blumenthal, however, said that a Saudi Arabia-Israel pact seemed unlikely before Israel “concludes its operation.”

During the call on Tuesday, Prince Mohammed and Mr. Biden “affirmed the importance of working toward a sustainable peace between Israelis and Palestinians as soon as the crisis subsides,” the White House said in its statement.

Prince Mohammed stressed the urgent need to halt military operations and return to a peace process to ensure that the Palestinians “obtain their legitimate rights,” the Saudi government said in its own statement. Neither statement mentioned a Palestinian state.

The potential deal that Saudi officials had been working on before the war included a path to a state for the Palestinians, the person with knowledge of the talks said.

Framing the prospect of building ties with Israel as a way to obtain greater rights for the Palestinians could allow Prince Mohammed to limit popular backlash in his own country, where hostility toward Israel and support for the Palestinians is widespread.

In response to questions about the Saudi warnings, the State Department said that “although U.S. diplomatic efforts are currently focused on the immediate crisis, we remain committed to the long-term goal of a more stable, prosperous and integrated Middle East region, including through normalization and advancement of a two-state solution.”

Before the Hamas attacks, however, American officials and analysts in Washington briefed on the talks said that the U.S.-Saudi discussions had been focused mainly on the Saudi security demands of the United States. Those officials and analysts said there had been no detailed discussion of the Palestinian issue.

An essay by Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, posted on the Foreign Affairs site this week, said that American officials were “committed to a two-state solution.”

But editors had allowed Mr. Sullivan to rewrite an earlier version of the essay from before the Oct. 7 attacks. The original version, published in the print edition of the magazine, makes no mention of Palestinian nationhood. It merely said that, although tensions persisted between Israel and the Palestinians, the Biden administration had “de-escalated crises in Gaza.”"
150,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-invasion-delay.html,"Its troops are massed on the Gaza border and described as ready to move, but Israel’s political and military leaders are divided about how, when and even whether to invade, according to seven senior military officers and three Israeli officials.

In part, they say, the delay is intended to give negotiators more time to try to secure the release of some of the more than 200 hostages captured by Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups when they raided Israel three weeks ago.

But Israeli leaders, who have vowed to retaliate against Hamas for its brutal massacre of civilians, have yet to agree on how to do so, though the military could move as soon as Friday.

Some of them worry that an invasion might suck the Israeli Army into an intractable urban battle inside Gaza. Others fear a broader conflict, with a Lebanese militia allied to Hamas, Hezbollah, firing long-range missiles toward Israeli cities.

There is also debate over whether to conduct the invasion through one large operation or a series of smaller ones. And then there are questions about who would govern Gaza if Israel captured it.

“You have a cabinet with different opinions,” said Danny Danon, a senior lawmaker from Likud, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing party.

“Some would say that we have to start — then we can think about the next stage,” said Mr. Danon, a member of the foreign affairs and defense committee in the Israeli Parliament. “But we as the leadership, as statesmen, we have to set the goals, and the goals should be very clear,” he said. “It shouldn’t be vague.”"

Now, he has turned to documenting daily life under Israeli bombardment. On Sunday, he posted a story about the daily struggle to find drinking water.

He records snippets as he walks, carrying a bright yellow jug to one of the few water stations still functioning in the southern city of Khan Younis. At the station, people — many of them children who struggle to carry the full jugs home — jostle for position in a chaotic line to fill up on well water.

“There’s no more water in the taps, so we have to go get water in this way,” Mr. Aborjela, a project coordinator with the development organization Youth Without Borders, told The New York Times. “The conditions for filling up water are not healthy. People are on top of one another and people are getting sick.”"

In some cities, posters have been torn down soon after they were put up. The artists were not shocked. “We knew it would happen,” Ms. Mintz said. “We are street artists — our art doesn’t last long.”

She added, “Our goal is to put up 10,000 for each that is take away. We need to keep it alive.”

For Ms. Mintz and Dede, life has become a cycle of canvassing unfamiliar New York neighborhoods looking for print shops, yanking intractable packing tape off its roll and trying to do their part to help absorb the horror felt by their fellow Israelis. The Israeli government now says nearly 200 people were kidnapped by Hamas terrorists.

“Grandparents kidnapped!” said Ms. Mintz as she looked through a ream of just printed fliers. “I can’t believe I am even saying those words.”

Now, with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians rendered homeless as the Israeli government urged them to flee to the south of Gaza in advance of a likely ground invasion, the artists said they were praying for peace. “I am not happy about what is happening in Gaza, it is awful,” Ms. Mintz said. “I want the Palestinians to be free from Hamas, I want our children to learn together, I want Palestine to prosper and to be wealthy, but they need different leadership.”"

The accelerated time frame means that eligible Israelis looking to flee the Israel-Hamas war will be able to get to the United States sooner than expected, without having to go through the typical process to apply for a visa, which can delay travel.

Last month, the Homeland Security and State Departments announced that Israel would be added to its visa-waiver program, an agreement between the United States and 40 other countries that allows citizens to travel without the hassle of getting a visa. At the time, the Biden administration set a Nov. 30 date for when Israelis could begin applying online for the new program.

To participate, countries must share information about passengers faster, including providing names on passenger lists.

To be eligible, Israeli citizens must have a biometric passport. And they must commit to staying no longer than 90 days. The application comes with a $21 fee.

Allowing Israel into the program has been a decade-long process. Some prominent groups have objected to Israel’s being allowed into the program out of concerns that the Israeli government would not treat Palestinian Americans equally."
154,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/us/ukraine-israel-aid-johnson.html,"That approach is at odds with the one favored by the White House, congressional Democrats and many mainstream Republicans who believe that the best way to ensure funding for both wars is to keep them together in one large package. The $105 billion measure Mr. Biden has requested includes $14.3 billion for Israel and $61.4 billion for Ukraine, as well as funds for Taiwan and border security in the United States.

“At the end of the day, these are all going to be linked together, and we’re going to be voting on a package,” said Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, who has been working to persuade Mr. Johnson to embrace such a measure.

But Mr. McCaul conceded that, given the pressures inside his own party, Mr. Johnson could act as soon as next week to push through an emergency spending bill covering only Israel.

Since the start of the war, Mr. Johnson has routinely offered praise and prayers for Ukraine’s fight against Russia, but he has voted against successive emergency spending measures. Scores of House Republicans have adopted a similar stance, and last month, a majority of them, including Mr. Johnson, voted against a bill to send Ukraine $300 million to arm and train its fighters.

Mr. McCaul, Representative Michael R. Turner, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and other top national-security-minded Republicans have been trying to impress upon Mr. Johnson that his new post requires a different approach to foreign policy than he has taken to date. During a Thursday meeting in the Situation Room with their Democratic counterparts and Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, they stressed to Mr. Johnson that if he moved ahead with an Israel-only funding bill, he must offer Ukraine some assurances that its plight against Russia would not be forgotten.

“This is not something we want to play politics with; it’s a very urgent national security issue,” Mr. McCaul said after the meeting. “I think pulling out of Ukraine would be a terrible mistake.”

Mr. Johnson’s comments to Mr. Hannity suggested he had taken the warning to heart. He promised not to abandon Ukraine, and noted that allowing Russia to win would embolden other U.S. adversaries. But he has yet to specify when he might bring up an aid package for Ukraine, how large it might be or what restrictions would have to be included.

Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, has pledged that his chamber will produce legislation to address multiple global threats, including Ukraine and Israel. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, has also stressed the urgency of addressing multiple crises at once, arguing in several floor speeches and a rare television interview that Congress must approve assistance for both Israel and Ukraine in order to counter Russia, Iran and China.

But bands of both House and Senate Republicans have been trying to stop that from happening.

On Thursday, five Republicans led by Representative Michael Waltz of Florida, a former Green Beret, wrote to Senate leaders warning them against including Ukraine funding in an aid package for Israel and the southern border.

“We are concerned that President Biden has used Israel’s existential struggle as an excuse to force billions more in additional spending through Congress, rather than address the nation’s most pressing emergencies,” they wrote.

A separate group in the Senate led by Senators Roger Marshall of Kansas and J.D. Vance of Ohio introduced legislation Thursday to provide military aid to Israel alone.

“Israel has an achievable objective,” Mr. Vance wrote in a memo he circulated among Senate Republicans before introducing the bill. “Ukraine does not.”"
155,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/opinion/israel-cancel-culture-debate.html,"Nathan Thrall’s searing new book, “A Day in the Life of Abed Salama,” struck me as important even before the obscene massacres and mass kidnappings committed by Hamas this month lit the Middle East on fire. Today, with people still struggling to understand the contours of this deeply complicated conflict, the book seems essential.

An expanded version of Thrall’s widely praised 2021 New York Review of Books article of the same name, the book follows a Palestinian man named Abed Salama as he searches for his 5-year-old son after a deadly school bus crash in the West Bank, a search hindered by Israel’s restrictions on Palestinian movement. Thrall, the former director of the Arab-Israeli project at the International Crisis Group, uses his reported account of the Salama family’s tragedy to offer a panoramic look at life under Israel’s occupation. He is deeply concerned with Palestinian grief, but also writes rich portraits of Israelis, including Beber Vanunu, founder of a settlement in the West Bank, and Dany Tirza, architect of the separation wall that cuts through the territory.

The day before Hamas’s attack on Israel, DAWN, an organization founded by the slain Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi to promote democracy in the Middle East, published an interview with Thrall. In it, Thrall was asked about his depictions of Israelis, and whether he had qualms about “humanizing the occupation.”

“I was very glad to be asked that question,” Thrall told me. “Because that was absolutely the ambition of the book, to depict real people” rather than villains and saints.

Because I admire “A Day in the Life of Abed Salama” so much, I agreed to moderate a talk with Thrall this Thursday in Brooklyn. But I’ve been shocked to learn that several of his other events, both in the United States and in Britain, have been canceled, either because of security fears or because it’s considered insensitive, right after the killings and abductions in Israel, to dwell on the plight of Palestinians.

“How does one promote a program on this subject to a largely Jewish audience when people on all sides are being bombed, killed and buried?” Andrea Grossman, whose Los Angeles nonprofit called off an event with Thrall, said in The Guardian. American Public Media, which distributes content for public radio stations nationwide, even pulled ads for the book. “We aim to avoid any perception of endorsing a specific perspective,” an APM spokesman said in an email, insisting that airing sponsorship spots for Thrall’s book would be “insensitive in light of the human tragedies unfolding.”

Thrall is not alone; in recent weeks several literary and cultural events by pro-Palestinian speakers or groups have been either scrapped or relocated. On Friday, the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen was supposed to speak at 92NY, a major literary venue in Manhattan formerly known as the 92nd Street Y. That afternoon, however, the talk was abruptly called off, apparently because of an open letter Nguyen had signed about the “violence and destruction in Palestine,” as well as because of his past support for the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel. (The talk ended up happening instead at a downtown bookstore.) The Boston Palestine Film Festival moved online, nixing its live screenings. A Hilton hotel in Houston canceled a conference of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, citing “security concerns.”

Part of me shudders to view the unfolding catastrophe in Israel and Gaza through the provincial lens of America’s cancel culture debate. In some ways, that debate has now come full circle, because pro-Palestinian voices were being censored long before the phrase “cancel culture” existed, one reason the left was unwise in recent years to prevaricate about the value of free speech. But if someone as evenhanded as Thrall now finds his talks being dropped, we’re in an especially repressive period. And in a time of war, particularly a war shrouded in fiercely competing narratives, free speech is more important than ever.

I don’t like the fact that the statement Nguyen signed gestured only vaguely at Hamas’s slaughter of Israeli civilians. In calling off his Friday evening appearance, 92NY, a Jewish organization, was playing by rules much of the left established, privileging sensitivity to traumatized communities ahead of the robust exchange of ideas. And supporters of Israel are hardly alone in creating a censorious atmosphere; particularly on college campuses, it is Zionists who feel silenced and intimidated. A professor at the University of California, Davis, is facing investigation by the university for a social media post calling for the targeting of “Zionist journalists,” which said, “They have houses with addresses, kids in school,” and included emojis of a knife, an ax and three drops of blood.

Nevertheless, a commitment to free speech, like a commitment to human rights, shouldn’t depend on others reciprocating; such commitments are worth trying to maintain even in the face of unfairness. “Art is one of the things that can keep our minds and hearts open, that can help us see beyond the hatred of war, that can make us understand that we cannot be divided into the human versus the inhuman because we are, all of us, human and inhuman at the same time,” Nguyen wrote on Instagram.

If the statement he signed didn’t live up to his own words’ generous spirit, 92NY would have been a good place to ask him why. The moments when dialogue is most fraught and bitter are when leaders most need to model it."

And Ms. Shehada, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, is afraid, to put it mildly, of what may come now, after the massacre of Israeli civilians by Hamas. “Everyone is in great distress,” she said. “There is a great fear that there will be a mighty revenge.”

In Lod, which lies just south of Tel Aviv, Jews and Arabs often live in the same building, she said, but now Arabs are reluctant to go into the air-raid shelters. “They say they see hate in the eyes of the Jews,” Ms. Shehada said. “They say they see hate, but I think what they really see is distress and fear.”

Arab citizens of Israel, many of whom want to be identified as Palestinians, make up some 18 percent of the population. They have been caught for years between their loyalty to the state and their desire for an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands, the creation of an independent Palestine and a better life for themselves."

158,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/us/politics/biden-funds-israel-ukraine-taiwan.html,"President Biden is expected to ask Congress in the coming days to approve about $100 billion in emergency funds to arm Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan and fortify the U.S.-Mexico border, according to multiple people familiar with the plan.

The funding request, which lawmakers expect to receive by Friday morning, would cover a full year and is aimed at insulating the security funding from the partisan spending battles that have hamstrung recent efforts to supply Ukraine with weapons and other assistance to beat back a Russian invasion.

The package is expected to include about $10 billion in mostly military assistance to help Israel, as well as around $60 billion for Ukraine, according to aides familiar with the discussions, who described the emerging proposal on the condition of anonymity because it has yet to be announced. The balance of the $100 billion is expected to be dedicated to border security and helping beef up the defenses of Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific region, in order to better counter threats from China.

Mr. Biden is scheduled to deliver remarks Thursday night from the Oval Office on the American response to the wars in Israel and Ukraine.

Over the last week, senior White House officials and Senate leaders signaled their intention to link aid for multiple national security objectives. The strategy reflects the growing urgency surrounding the war in Ukraine and the sudden outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas.

They are pursuing one large package of aid despite objections from Republicans in the House, where the majority of G.O.P. members enthusiastically support equipping Israel with the weapons to fight Hamas but have soured on continuing to send military assistance to Ukraine for its fight against Russian aggression.

Last month, the majority of House Republicans voted against continuing a $300 million program to train and equip Ukrainian fighters. While the measure ultimately passed with Democratic support, the vote reflected a dampening of support in the Republican Party for helping Ukraine. Some G.O.P. lawmakers argue doing so siphons money away from domestic security concerns and could put the United States closer to a direct confrontation with Russia.

Republicans in both the Senate and House have insisted that they would need concessions from Democrats to support additional funds for Ukraine, including strict immigration restrictions and border security funding. Accomplishing that became easier in recent days, after the Biden administration announced that it would revive construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

On Wednesday, some Republicans expressed cautious support for the idea of a combined national security package.

“From what I know generally, I’d be inclined to, presuming that the border security piece of it is real border security,” Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, told reporters Wednesday.

But it is not clear how swiftly Congress might be able to pass such a bill. Legislative activity in the House has been at a standstill for more than two weeks, as Republican lawmakers struggle to elect a speaker.

In the Senate, however, leaders are promising to move quickly on the measure.

“I asked Secretary Austin when he needs funding for our ongoing efforts. His answer was crystal clear: Yesterday,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, told reporters after a classified briefing at the Capitol with Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and other top defense, diplomatic and intelligence officials.

“The Senate will not wait” to act on such requests, Mr. Schumer added. The New York Democrat has previously said he intends to put an emergency national security spending package on the Senate floor within a couple of weeks."
159,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/us/politics/israel-hezbollah-us-gaza-hamas.html,"U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies are working to determine whether Israel’s expected ground offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip could prompt Hezbollah to launch a large-scale military campaign against Israel from Lebanon, American and Israeli officials said.

American officials said they believe the deployment of two carrier strike groups, each of which consists of an aircraft carrier, its planes and several escort warships, has — for now — appeared to deter Hezbollah from attacking Israel in a major way. Israel has also reinforced its northern border after the attack by Hamas on Oct. 7, in which 1,400 people were killed.

Israeli and American officials currently assess that Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, does not want an all-out war with Israel, for fear of the damage it would do to his group and Lebanon. U.S. officials said that assessment could change as more intelligence is gathered and events unfold.

In addition, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has vetoed proposals from his government of a pre-emptive strike against Hezbollah, according to American officials and others briefed on the discussions."

The second carrier, the Dwight D. Eisenhower, is expected to arrive in the next few days.

The Air Force is also rushing additional land-based attack planes to the Persian Gulf region, doubling the number of F-16, A-10 and F-15E squadrons on the ground. Combined with the four squadrons of F/A-18 jets aboard each carrier, the United States will have an aerial armada of more than 100 attack planes, officials said.

161,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/opinion/israel-gaza-palestine-war.html,"If you care about Israel, you should be more worried than any other time since 1967. Back then, Israel defeated the armies of three Arab states — Egypt, Syria and Jordan — in what became known as the Six-Day War. Today, if you look closely, you’ll see that Israel is now fighting the Six-Front War.

This war is being fought by and through nonstate actors, nation-states, social networks, ideological movements, West Bank communities and Israeli political factions, and it is the most complex war that I’ve ever covered. But one thing is crystal clear to me: Israel cannot win this six-front war alone. It can win only if Israel — and the United States — can assemble a global alliance.

Unfortunately, Israel today has a prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and a ruling coalition that will not and cannot produce the keystone needed to sustain such a global alliance. That keystone is to declare an end to the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and overhaul Israel’s relations with the Palestinian Authority so that it becomes a credible, legitimate Palestinian partner that can govern a post-Hamas Gaza and forge a broader two-state solution including the West Bank.

If Israel is asking its best allies to help the Jewish state seek justice in Gaza while asking them to look the other way as Israel builds a settlement kingdom in the West Bank with the express goal of annexation, that is strategically and morally incoherent.

It won’t work. Israel will not be able to generate the time, the financial assistance, the legitimacy, the Palestinian partner or the global allies it needs to win this six-front war.

And all six fronts are now hiding in plain sight.

First, Israel is fighting a full-scale war against Hamas in and around Gaza, in which, we can now see, Hamas still has so much residual capacity that it was able to launch a seaborne attack on Israel on Tuesday and on Wednesday fired long-range rockets toward Israel’s southern port city of Eilat and northern port city of Haifa.



It is terrifying to see how many resources Hamas diverted to build weapons rather than to aid Gaza’s human capital — and how effectively it hid that from Israel and the world. Indeed, it is hard not to notice the contrast between Gaza’s evident human poverty and the wealth of weaponry Hamas has built and deployed.

Hamas’s dream has long been the unification of the fronts surrounding Israel, regionally and globally. Israel’s strategy has always been to act in ways to prevent that — until this Netanyahu coalition of ultra-Orthodox and Jewish supremacists came to power last December and began behaving in ways that actually helped foster the unification of the anti-Israel fronts.

How so? The Jewish supremacists in Netanyahu’s cabinet immediately began to challenge the status quo on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, which is revered by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and where one of Islam’s holiest sites, the Aqsa Mosque, stands. The Netanyahu government began taking steps to impose much harsher conditions on Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza held in Israeli jails. And it laid plans for a huge expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank to prevent a contiguous Palestinian state from ever coming into being there. This is the first Israeli government ever to make annexation of the West Bank a stated objective in its coalition agreement.

On top of all of this, the United States appeared to be getting close to forging a deal for Saudi Arabia to normalize diplomatic and commercial relations with Israel — which would have been the crowning achievement of Netanyahu’s effort to prove that Israel could have normal relations with Arab and Muslim states and not have to give one inch to the Palestinians.

Which leads to the second front: Israel against Iran and its other proxies. That is, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, Islamist militias in Syria and Iraq and the Houthi militia in Yemen.

All of them in recent days have launched drones and rockets toward Israel or at U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. I believe that Iran, like Hamas, saw the U.S.-Israel effort to normalize relations between Israel and Arab-Muslim states as a strategic threat that would have left Iran and its proxies isolated in the region. At the same time, I believe Hezbollah came to realize that if Israel obliterated Hamas, as it declared it would, Hezbollah would be next. It would also be much weaker without Hamas draining energy and focus from Israel’s military. Therefore, Hezbollah decided that, at a minimum, it needed to open a low-grade second front against Israel.

As a result, Israel has been forced to evacuate some 130,000 civilians from its northern border along with the tens of thousands of Israelis evacuated from the southwestern border with Gaza. This whole displacement puts a huge stress on housing and the Israeli treasury.

The third front is the universe of social networks and other digital narratives about who is good and who is evil. When the world gets this interdependent, when — thanks to smartphones and social networks — nothing is hidden and we can hear one another whisper, the dominant narrative has real strategic value. That social media was so easily manipulated by Hamas that the episode of a misfired Palestinian missile hitting a Gaza hospital was initially blamed on Israel is deeply disturbing, because these narratives shape the decisions of governments and politicians and the relationship between chief executives and their employees. Be advised: If Israel does invade Gaza, corporations everywhere will be facing competing demands from employees to denounce Israel or Hamas.

The fourth front is the intellectual/philosophical struggle between the international progressive movement and Israel. I believe that some elements of that progressive movement, which I realize is big and diverse, have lost their moral bearings on this issue. For instance, we’ve seen numerous demonstrations on American college campuses that essentially blame Israel for the barbaric Hamas invasion, arguing that Hamas is engaged in a legitimate “anticolonial struggle.” These progressive demonstrators seem to believe that all of Israel is a colonial enterprise — not just the West Bank settlements — and therefore the Jewish people do not have the right either to self-determination or self-defense in their ancestral homeland, whether it’s within post-1967 borders or pre-1967 ones.

And for an intellectual community seemingly concerned about nations occupying other nations and denying their right to self-rule, you don’t see a lot of progressive college campus demonstrations against the biggest oppressing power in the Middle East today: Iran.

Besides crushing its own women seeking greater freedom of thought and dress, Tehran is effectively controlling four Arab states — Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq — through its proxies. Lebanon, a country I know well, has not been able to elect a new president for a year in large part because Iran refuses to allow the Lebanese to have any president who will not always bend to Tehran’s wishes and interests. Unfortunately, independent Lebanese are powerless to remove Iran’s grip over their Parliament and government, exercised largely through the barrel of Hezbollah guns. Middle East Eye reported that back in 2014 Ali Reza Zakani, a Tehran city representative in the Iranian Parliament, was boasting about how Iran now rules in four Arab capitals: Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut and Sana, Yemen.

To reduce this incredibly complex struggle of two peoples for the same land to a colonial war is to commit intellectual fraud. Or as the Israeli writer Yossi Klein Halevi put it in The Times of Israel on Wednesday: “To blame the occupation and its consequences wholly on Israel is to dismiss the history of Israeli peace offers and Palestinian rejection. To label Israel as one more colonialist creation is to distort the unique story of the homecoming of an uprooted people, a majority of whom were refugees from destroyed Jewish communities in the Middle East.”"
162,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/climate/gaza-war-climate-change.html,"Global efforts to address climate change are already clouded by bitterness and distrust among countries of the world.

Now a widening gyre of conflict in the Middle East threatens to fracture an already divided world, raise oil and gas prices at a time of persistently high global inflation and direct financial resources to the business of fighting wars instead of the business of slowing down climate change.

That the fighting between Israel and Hamas is in the middle of an energy-rich region amplifies the risk. It tempts countries to secure their supplies of oil and gas rather than transitioning away from them, even after the hottest summer on record.

The winners so far are the producers of weapons and, to a lesser degree, of oil. Defense stocks have rallied. Oil prices inched up. The historical echoes are chilling, coming 50 years after the Arab oil embargo roiled energy markets. That episode was provoked by the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.

All of this makes the next round of climate negotiations, scheduled for late November in the United Arab Emirates, itself a Persian Gulf petrostate, even more complicated.

The next few weeks will be crucial. If the conflict spills across the Middle East, it would likely shatter hopes of mustering global agreement on anything else, including the shared crisis of climate.

“This is a fundamental test of whether nations can firewall climate diplomacy from immediate crises,” said Comfort Ero, president of the International Crisis Group, a research organization.

Leaders of the U.A.E., who continue to expand oil and gas production, face a particularly acute challenge. They are responsible for bringing countries together at the climate talks, even as they are expected to take up the Palestinians’ cause at the United Nations Security Council, where they hold a rotating seat this year.

Risk: Cooperation Fractures Further

The conflict has erupted at a time of many crises across a deeply divided world. It follows a global pandemic and comes amid a war in Ukraine that has pummeled economies, driven countries deeper into debt, raised food and fuel prices, and worsened hunger among some of the world’s poorest people.

“Any increase in geopolitical tensions, any fracturing of multilateralism, will potentially make significant cooperative progress more difficult,” said Tim Benton, director of the Environment and Society Center at Chatham House, a London-based research organization.

Already tensions between the United States and China, the world’s two biggest economies and also the two biggest emitters of planet-heating greenhouse gases, have spilled into climate politics. In the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Moscow and Beijing have strengthened ties.

At the same time, India is buying discounted oil from Russia and Russia is courting countries in Africa and the Middle East.

Among the world’s less-wealthy nations, grievances are piling up over the West’s failure to share access to Covid vaccines and provide sufficient financial aid to help poor countries deal with climate hazards.

Risk: Inflation Gets Worse

The global economy remains sluggish, and an increase in oil prices could further complicate central bankers’ efforts to tame inflation.

Biden administration officials are particularly nervous about oil. So far, energy has avoided a big supply shock, but it could see one if the conflict spreads to Iran or other major oil producers nearby.

Even a temporary loss of oil supply could once again send gasoline prices soaring in the United States, eroding voter support for President Biden and leaving him more vulnerable to Republicans who have attacked his climate agenda. U.S. officials worry that erosion would more than offset any climate gains from a temporary period of high oil prices, like $5-a-gallon gasoline pushing more people to buy electric cars."
163,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-invasion.html,"The Israeli military is preparing to invade the Gaza Strip soon with tens of thousands of soldiers ordered to capture Gaza City and destroy the enclave’s current leadership, according to three senior Israeli military officers who outlined unclassified details about the plan.

The military has announced that its ultimate goal is to wipe out the top political and military hierarchy of Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls Gaza and led last week’s terrorist attacks in Israel that killed 1,300 people.

The assault is expected to be Israel’s biggest ground operation since it invaded Lebanon in 2006. It would also be the first in which Israel has attempted to capture land and at least briefly hold onto it since its invasion of Gaza in 2008, according to the three senior officers.

The operation risks locking Israel into months of bloody urban combat, both above ground and in a warren of tunnels — a fraught offensive that Israel has long avoided because it involves fighting in a narrow and tightly packed sliver of land populated by more than 2 million people. Israeli officials have warned that Hamas could kill Israeli hostages, use Palestinian noncombatants as human shields, and have strewn the territory with booby traps."
164,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/us/politics/wray-threats-us.html,"The F.B.I. director warned Tuesday that the Israel-Hamas war had raised the potential for an attack against Americans to a new level and escalated threats against Jews and Muslims in the United States.

Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said foreign terrorist organizations had called for violence against Jews after the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas assailants prompted Israel to besiege and bombard the Gaza Strip, where Hamas is in control.

“We assess that the actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration the likes of which we haven’t seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate several years ago,” Mr. Wray told senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee during a hearing about worldwide threats to the United States.

“The ongoing war in the Middle East has raised the threat of an attack against Americans in the United States to a whole other level,” he added. The biggest concern for the agency is attacks from violent extremists or lone actors in the U.S. inspired by hateful messages and calls to violence.

The number of antisemitic acts in the United States had been on the rise even before the Israel-Hamas war, led in part by white supremacist propaganda and new nationalist groups across the country. But since the attack by Hamas on Oct. 7, the drumbeat of antisemitic threats and acts has drastically increased.

“I will say that this is a threat that is reaching in some way sort of historic levels,” Mr. Wray said.

“The Jewish community is targeted by terrorists really across the spectrum — homegrown violent extremists; foreign terrorist organizations, both Sunni and Shia; domestic violent extremists,” he added.

Mr. Wray cited several foreign terrorist groups who have issued calls to attack Americans, and Jews in particular, in the wake of the attacks by Hamas. On Oct. 7, Hamas gunmen killed more than 1,400 people, including women and children, and abducted more than 200 people.

The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has called for attacks on Jewish communities in the United States and Europe, and Al Qaeda issued a specific call to attack the United States, Mr. Wray said.

The call from Al Qaeda urged “Islamic movements” to form sleeper cells and support “operations against the Jews and their interests,” according to a person who saw parts of the message and who spoke on condition of anonymity to share sensitive information. Mr. Wray said the message from Al Qaeda was the most specific call to attack the United States that intelligence officials have seen in five years.

“To have this many foreign terrorist organizations this explicitly calling for attacks,” Mr. Wray said, significantly elevates the potential terror threats to the United States.

The war has been politically divisive in the United States as well. On some college campuses in the United States, posters of victims kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7 are being torn down in protest of Israel’s response to the attack and its longtime treatment of Palestinians. Private companies, universities and even the Writers Guild of America have been criticized for statements officials have and have not issued about the new wave of violence in the Middle East.

Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the secretary of homeland security, said that since Oct. 7, federal officials have responded to an increase in threats against “Jewish, Muslim and Arab American communities and institutions across our country.”

Jews represent less than 3 percent of the American population, but even before Oct. 7 they were the target of about 60 percent of the religious-based hate crimes, Mr. Wray said, citing statistics from 2022.

Between Oct. 7 and Oct. 23, there were 312 antisemitic acts in the United States, 190 of which were directly linked to the war, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Those include an incident on Oct. 15 at Grand Central Terminal in New York when someone reportedly punched a Jewish woman in the face because she was Jewish.

Mr. Wray pointed to a recent arrest in Houston on Oct. 19 of a Palestinian asylum seeker who had been in the United States since June 2019 on a travel visa that expired a few months later. Mr. Wray said that the man, who prosecutors identified as Sohaib Abuayyash, 20, had been studying how to build bombs and posted details online about his support for killing Jewish people.

Prosecutors said he was illegally in possession of a firearm and had been in contact with “others who share a radical mindset, has been conducting physical training and has trained with weapons to possibly commit an attack,” according to the criminal complaint, which was mostly redacted.

Biden administration officials have been in regular contact with members of Jewish communities across the country, Mr. Wray said, adding that the bureau had previously created an intelligence fusion cell with agents who work on hate crimes and domestic terrorism “to make sure that we’re seeing the full landscape and doing our best to be proactive in this space.”

In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on Tuesday up to $75 million in grants for local police departments and houses of worship in response to an uptick in reported antisemitic attacks and hate crimes against Palestinians in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.

Hate-fueled attacks against Muslims and Arabs in the United States have also been on the rise since Oct. 7. The Council on American Islamic Relations, a civil rights organization, said it received more than 700 complaints, including reported bias incidents and threats to shoot and kill American Muslims, between Oct. 7 and Oct. 25. The organization said the number of incidents and threats have not been this high since December 2015, after Donald Trump, then a presidential candidate, said he would ban Muslims from traveling to the United States.

The most prominent of these recent attacks is the murder of a 6-year-old Palestinian American in Illinois. The landlord of the residence where the boy and his mother were living was arrested for stabbing them both in what is being treated as a hate crime.

In New York, police arrested two men recently and charged them with hate crimes for allegedly being part of a group that shouted anti-Muslim slurs during an Oct. 11 attack on three men. A 2022 F.B.I. report said nearly 8 percent of religious-based hate crimes were directed at Muslims, which is similar to 2021 levels.

165,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/15/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-mood-distrust.html,"On the ninth day after Hamas overran more than 20 Israeli pastoral communities and army bases, killing more than 1,300 people and taking 150 hostages back to Gaza, Israel was a country on edge.

Israelis were girding with grim determination for what they widely see as a war of no choice after the attack on Oct. 7 — the deadliest day for Jews in Israel’s 75-year history and, officials say, since the Holocaust. They were awaiting an imminent ground invasion into the Palestinian enclave controlled by Hamas even as tensions escalated on the northern border with Lebanon, threatening a long and devastating conflict on several fronts.

All this is happening amid a total breakdown of trust between the citizens and the state of Israel, and a collapse of everything Israelis believed in and relied on. Initial assessments point to an Israeli intelligence failure before the surprise attack, the failure of a sophisticated border barrier, the military’s slow initial response and a government that seems to have busied itself with the wrong things and now appears largely absent and dysfunctional.

“We have woken to a terrible sobriety about whose hands we put our fate in,” said Dorit Rabinyan, an author in Tel Aviv. “All the time you said to yourself, ‘I am paying half of what I earn in taxes, but it is for security, national security, at least that.’”"

The convoys that have arrived in Gaza so far were not enough, he said. “We need a constant stream of aid pouring in.”

The Gaza Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas, reported a sharp rise in the death toll after Israel’s latest barrage. The ministry said on Monday at least 436 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes “in the past hours,” including 182 children.

The statement brought the death toll in Gaza to more than 5,000 people, according to the ministry, since Israel began retaliating for the Hamas assaults of Oct. 7. The figures could not be independently verified, and Israel’s military has sometimes accused Hamas of inflating the count.

Before that attack, conditions were already dire for the over two million Palestinians who live in Gaza, which was under a crushing blockade by Egypt and Israel and had faced soaring unemployment and frequent shortages of medicine and fuel.

Now, residents and aid workers say, survival in Gaza is an increasingly desperate challenge. Clean water is hard to find, and fuel nearly impossible. Medicine is dwindling and hospitals are packed with the wounded, the displaced and the dead.

After the Hamas attack this month, Israel enacted what it called a “complete siege,” barring entry of fuel, food and water. In recent days, the Israeli authorities have agreed not to block the entry of some aid convoys into Gaza by way of Egypt’s Rafah border crossing, provided there is oversight and the assistance does not reach Hamas.

Fear has been mounting for the safety of the hostages abducted from Israel, especially as Israelis learned from the military on Monday that 222 people were believed to be held captive, 10 more than previously known. The captives are believed to be scattered and hidden around Gaza, with many likely held in the tunnels and bunkers that Hamas uses beneath the territory.

On Monday night, the Israeli prime minister’s office confirmed that Hamas had released Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifshitz, 85. The group had also released two American-Israeli women on Friday, citing “humanitarian reasons” and mediation by Qatar.

Ms. Lifshitz and her husband, Oded, an Israeli journalist, were peace activists, family members said. Mr. Lifshitz had volunteered to drive sick Gazans seeking medical treatment in Israel from the Erez checkpoint to Israeli hospitals, according to his family.

Both women were taken captive by Hamas gunmen on Oct. 7 when they invaded Nir Oz, the kibbutz where the Lifshitzes lived. The small community of 400 was particularly hard-hit, with scores dead, missing or taken as captives to Gaza.

“My father spent his life fighting for peace,” Sharone Lifshitz, the couple’s daughter, told a news conference in London this month. “We are going to spend the rest of our lives dealing with this atrocity,” she added.

“Time is running out very fast,” the official, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, said during a live televised interview with Iranian state television on Monday night. “If the war crimes against the Palestinians are not immediately stopped, other multiple fronts will open and this is inevitable.”

Mr. Amir Abdollahian spoke after returning to Tehran from a tour of capitals aligned or close to Iran. He met the top political official of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, in Doha, Qatar; the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut; and President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in Damascus.

In the interview, he said that in those meetings, the leaders of what is regionally called “the resistance” told him that “their hands are on the trigger” and said that “pre-emptive action” was possible “in the coming few hours” because those leaders would “naturally not allow the Zionist regime to do whatever it wants in Gaza” and then turn its attention to them."
169,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/travel/europe-travel-disruptions-israel-hamas.html,"As the war between Hamas and Israel intensifies in the Middle East, tensions are spilling over into Europe, where demonstrations and terrorist attacks are causing disruptions for locals and visitors alike.

Last week, monuments and government buildings across Europe were lit up in blue and white — a show of solidarity with Israel after the assault by Hamas on Oct. 7 that killed at least 1,400 Israeli civilians. Within days, tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters were marching across European cities to protest the Israeli bombardment of Gaza that followed. A deadly explosion at a hospital in Gaza on Tuesday, which left Palestinians and Israelis trading blame, has threatened further unrest.

Local authorities have ramped up security as clashes erupted over the weekend in London, Paris, Madrid and Rome. In France, security threats have forced the evacuation of sites like the Louvre Museum, along with several airports.

Security experts say that while it is still broadly safe to travel to Europe, it is important to be aware of demonstrations and show vigilance toward any perceived threat."
170,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/world/middleeast/biden-israel-gaza-anger.html,"President Biden’s trip to Israel on Wednesday has landed him in a region where grief and fury are mounting, not only toward Israel, but also toward the United States, which has declared unyielding support for its chief Middle East ally.

On Tuesday, widespread condemnation of Israel rippled across the Arab and Muslim world after a huge blast at a hospital in the Gaza Strip killed hundreds of Palestinians who had been seeking treatment or refuge. Palestinian authorities accused Israel of striking the hospital, while Israel blamed a Palestinian group, Islamic Jihad, for an errant rocket launch.

Regardless of whatever evidence emerges, few people in the wider Middle East are likely to believe Israel's version, as protesters took to the streets in Jordan, Lebanon, Yemen and Oman to condemn the country.

Even before Tuesday’s disaster, many people across the region had come to see Israel’s war with Hamas — the Palestinian armed group that carried out a shocking attack on southern Israel last week, slaughtering roughly 1,400 people — as an American-backed massacre of Palestinian civilians in the blockaded territory of Gaza.

Israel has cut off water, medicine and electricity in the enclave and targeted Gaza with airstrikes, killing more than 3,500 Palestinians, according to Gazan authorities.

Many Arabs say the American government is not only indifferent to the agony of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation, but also complicit in it. American pledges of “ironclad” support for Israel — and no-strings-attached security assistance — have stoked those feelings as all signs point to Israel preparing for a ground invasion of Gaza.

“There is tremendous anger in the Arab world, even by those who do not support Hamas,” said Nabil Fahmy, a former foreign minister of Egypt. “They are giving Israel a green light,” he said of Western powers, “and as this gets increasingly bloody, the West will have blood on its hands.”

So intense is the anger that a refrain, “Death to America,” has found renewed resonance in the region, including during a protest on Friday in Bahrain, a close American ally.

“America has to do something and stop these heinous crimes against Palestinians,” said Ahmed al-Asmi, 36, an Omani who participated in a demonstration in the country’s capital, Muscat, on Wednesday.

Many Palestinians and other Arabs said in interviews that the rhetoric coming from senior Israeli and American officials has been dehumanizing and warmongering."

But to hear the way it’s being described in American conservative media, much of the fault and responsibility lies with one man: President Biden.

The operational failures that allowed Hamas to plan and execute the attack without warning? American intelligence, not just Israeli intelligence, dropped the ball, conservative critics said over the past week.

The money Hamas raised to pull off such an organized, multipronged military operation? The Biden administration’s loosening of financial sanctions allowed Iran to funnel money to Hamas, its longtime beneficiary, they insisted.

And in the rare situation when conservative pundits found something they liked about Mr. Biden’s response — many acknowledged they were pleased to hear him denounce the deadly Hamas incursion as “pure, unadulterated evil” — the compliments quickly became condemnation."

My name is Fadi Abu Shammalah. And I’m the executive director of the General Union of Cultural Centers in Palestine and the Outreach Associate of Just Vision in Gaza Strip. I’m staying in Khan Yunis refugee camp in Southern Gaza. [MUSIC PLAYING] This morning, the Israeli army gave an evacuation order to everyone living in north Gaza and Gaza City. At that time, my brain started imagining, like, what is going to happen? Because I know what does mean, we are talking about 1.1 million people have to evacuate their homes. People were panicked, were terrified of that. And they knew that we had — they have less than 24 hours. And if we will take into consideration the night hours, that means they have maximum 12 hours to move, to package their most important stuff from their home and to look for a taxi. The markets itself are very, very close to be empty. A lot of stuff is gone from the supermarkets and there’s long lines. Over at the bakeries, there is not much, enough bread and food for the people. And we have a severe shortage of water. I started receiving many phone calls of friends, colleagues, and people who know me that they are asking me for support and for helping to get them into the south of Gaza Strip. Those cities don’t have the capacity to host this number of displaced people. In fact, when I saw those people are working, I remembered a photo that I have seen many years ago about — about Palestine where they were evacuating our historical villages and towns in 1948. The only difference between the current and the past, that today some of these people, are having cars and taxis to move on, while our grandfathers and mothers were — were have to walk from the very north of Palestine into the south of Palestine. This scene today make me feel very sad to my people in the 1948 and make a red alarm for me. Earlier this week, I wrote about the horrors me and my family and countless families like ours have already faced under Israel’s attacks. On Tuesday, a bomb exploded a few hundred feet from where I was sitting with my wife, Safa, and my three children, Ali, Karam, and Adam. I had been lucky enough to obtain permits for my wife and kids to cross into Egypt, so they could wait without the terrifying violence raining down in Gaza in safety. But before their names were called, Israel bombed the crossing. [CHAOTIC SCREAMING AND VOICES]

speaker 1 This was the scene on Tuesday at the Rafah Border Crossing between Gaza and Egypt — plumes of dust and smoke rise in the sky. People frantically look for cover following the Israeli airstrikes.

173,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/nyregion/public-schools-israel-war-hamas-gaza.html,"New York City is home to the largest population of Jews outside of Israel and one of the nation’s biggest Muslim communities. In a message sent in the days after the attacks, state leaders mourned the “inhumane atrocities” and emphasized “opportunities for open discussions about managing the trauma of the war.” Some Jewish families and groups criticized it as too weak.

But when the New York City schools chancellor sent out a statement on the “devastating impact of terrorism,” three Muslim and Arab teachers at city public schools, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution, said in interviews they were hurt and distressed that it did not acknowledge Palestinians, or extend concern to educators and families with relatives in Gaza.

In other districts, officials have sent follow-up messages or apologies to try and tamp down fury from families and other groups.

In Atlanta, the public school district said it was “no stranger to the universal struggle for justice and equality,” referring to the nonviolent protests of local students during the Civil Rights Movement, in its initial response.

“I was honestly so deeply disappointed,” said Emily Kaiman, a Jewish parent with two children in Atlanta public schools. “Calling out terrorism should not be controversial.”

One of her daughters in eighth grade has struggled to focus in her classes as her mind wanders to the war, she added. “I wish the district had put something out there that made her feel seen, and like she had someone for support,” Ms. Kaiman said. Officials later released a second statement with additional resources.

From Cambridge, Mass., to Fairfax, Va., the frustrations have at times boiled over. Many parents and high school students who have publicly spoken out have faced doxxing, harassment or threats. Other families have launched petitions to expel school board members.

Some districts have encountered problems even as they largely attempt to stay out of the fray publicly. At a school board meeting last week in Cherry Hill, N.J., outside of Philadelphia, more than a dozen Jewish, Palestinian and Muslim students described conflicts breaking out in school classrooms and cafeterias.

One Jewish teenager said his peers who are supportive of Israel were accosted during a lunch period, and another said she felt anxious. Several Muslim students said they were labeled “animals” or told they “all deserve to die.” One said that after he wore a checkered scarf known as a kaffiyeh with a Palestinian flag, his teacher called him a “terrorist” in math class.

The school’s Muslim, Jewish, and Middle Eastern-North African student groups recently took things into their own hands: In a statement, they urged their peers to treat each other “not as adversaries but as the individuals we’ve grown up alongside since kindergarten.”

Still, at the meeting, nearly every student said their school had done far too little to address the war, leaving the burden to fall on them. The lack of immediate action allowed tensions to escalate, said one teenager, Kyle, whose last name is being withheld because of his age.

Montgomery County, Maryland’s largest school district, was already dealing with a rise in antisemitism after swastikas were drawn on classroom desks and “Jews Not Welcome” was painted on a school entrance sign. Adam Zimmerman, a holocaust educator and Jewish parent of two children in the district, said officials were “caught flat-footed” at the time.

After the Hamas attack, families again heard nothing for several days, which he called “deeply upsetting.”

“We’re not asking school districts to solve the Middle East conflict,” Mr. Zimmerman said, adding that students are often encouraged to “stand up and speak out” for those in need. “If we’re expecting the kids to do it, the grown-ups should be able to do it too.”"
174,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/opinion/israel-gaza-war.html,"Israel stands on the verge of invading Gaza in response to the terrorist attacks by Hamas that many, including Israel’s leaders, have compared to Sept. 11 not just because of the scale and savagery but also because the terrorists sought to destroy the tranquillity of daily life. They killed the very young and the very old, the strong and the weak, civilians and soldiers; they took some 150 hostages, including children, and survivors said the attackers raped women — all to send a message that no Israeli was safe.

Israel has a responsibility to its citizens to hold accountable the perpetrators of this violence, but as Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week, “How Israel does this matters.”

Israel cannot win this war just by killing all the terrorists. It is determined to break the power of Hamas, and in that effort it deserves the support of the United States and the rest of the world. But it can succeed only by upholding the rules and norms of behavior that Hamas so wantonly ignores. What Israel is fighting to defend is a society that values human life and the rule of law. To do that, the means and the ends of its military response must be consistent.

Israel’s goal is to destroy Hamas; in doing that, it should not lose sight of its commitment to safeguard those who have not taken up arms."

My name is Thomas Friedman. I have been a foreign affairs columnist for The New York Times since 1995. I’ve been covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a reporter since 1978. Since Hamas’s attack, which was launched 6:30 a.m. local time in Israel last Saturday, the Biden administration has really been engaged on two fronts — supporting Israel, one, materially, and one, morally.

Materially, the administration has made clear it will make whatever weapons, supplies Israel needs. But at the same time, the administration has moved an aircraft carrier group somewhere off the Coast of Cyprus to be on hand, both to deter Iran and, if needed — hopefully, we’re not going to be engaged in a war. And President Biden, on Tuesday afternoon at the White House, gave, really, one of the great speeches of his life, coming out unequivocally, unabashedly, unashamedly, 100 percent in support of defending Israel against what has been really just a barbaric attack by Hamas, not to seize territory but to seize hostages and to simply kill any man, woman, and child who they happen to stumble upon.

My message to the President is we have a very important role to play right now in this conflict, and that role is to back Israel at a time when it’s had to deal with maybe the worst performance of its military in the history of the country, to ensure, though, that Israel, in retaliating, does it in a way that doesn’t undermine its moral support in the world right now or involve it being enmeshed in Gaza for the long term, and redoubling American efforts to forge an alliance between Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the West Bank Palestinian Authority. Because only with that foundation can you build a stable future for that country and that region.

I think that when you get embroiled in this kind of conflict, the first and only question you need to ask is, what do my enemies want me to do, and how do I do just the opposite? So for Israel, what his main enemies, Hamas and its Iranian backer, want is for Israel to go into Gaza, get enmeshed in street fighting and door-to-door fighting that kills a lot of Palestinian civilians. That is Hamas’s dream, because that will undermine Israel morally, break its support in the West, and weaken Israel by enmeshing it in urban warfare in Gaza while it still faces challenges in the West Bank and on its northern front, increasingly, with Hezbollah.

Their other dream is that the planned US effort to create normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel and the West Bank Palestinian Authority, a sort of moderate alliance there, that by tempting Israel or forcing Israel to create a lot of civilian casualties Gaza, that that will blow up that American diplomatic effort to build a united front of moderate forces from Saudi Arabia to Israel, to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. So those are the two things that Hamas really wants. Those are the two things we absolutely shouldn’t do.

I hope Israel does not go into Gaza or doesn’t go in very far along and stay there. And I hope the administration doesn’t abandon the effort to forge a normalization deal between Israel and the West Bank Palestinians and Saudi Arabia, but actually doubles down on it. I wouldn’t predict anything, but I can tell you what I’m watching.

Will Israel go into Gaza in a big way, with its troops and armored vehicles? Second, I’m watching whether Hezbollah gets into the war from Lebanon and opens up a second front. And third, actually, I am watching Saudi Arabia and whether it will stand publicly with Israel and the United States or feel that it has to kind of slide back into pro-Palestinian mode, even pro-Hamas mode, to satisfy its people and not the elite who are ready to forge a different kind of relationship with Israel.

Well, obviously, for Israel, it’s an existential moment. And how this moment ends, how this drama now playing out ends, will be very important. That is, OK, if Israel is going to take Hamas out of Gaza, who will replace Hamas?

And there’s a reason Israel has been living with Hamas in Gaza for all this time since 2007. Because there’s no obvious alternative. And so you’re going to take Gaza, and you’re going to take down Hamas. What is the alternative?

Is it the West Bank Palestinian Authority? They’re also in disarray. Is it Israel? God forbid. Is it an Arab peacekeeping force? Good luck with that.

So there’s a lot of uncertainty here. Have the Israelis thought about the morning after? One could excuse them for being totally enraged right now, but I do think it’s important to think about that."

In rural Lone Rock, Wis., where harvest season had meant yet another long workday on Thursday, Randy Schmidt, 60, a dairy farmer, said the president’s appeal for military aid was “going to be a hard sell in these parts.”

Mr. Schmidt owns the largest dairy farm in Richland County, a swing district that had voted for the winning presidential candidate in every election since 1980, until 2020, when voters there went for former President Trump’s re-election.

“I mean, money comes hard here,” Mr. Schmidt said. “It’s been a relatively tough year of farming for us. I think as a country, we do support Israel, but I couldn’t believe we can do that much.”

In suburban Milwaukee, however, the questions posed by the violence in the Middle East and Ukraine were less economic than moral for Janet Lucas. The terrorist attacks by Hamas against Israelis, in particular, were triggering for her, she said.

“I understand that there has been a fight between the two for years and years,” said Ms. Lucas, 58. “But the way that it was handled recently, my heart just broke of the devastation,” she said of the Hamas killings and kidnappings of Israeli families. “It took me back to 9/11 — the same feeling, the same fear of, you know, is it going to happen to us, or who’s next?”

On Friday she went to Holy Hill, a basilica on a forested hillside, a country drive away from her community, Brookfield, to take in the fall colors with her son, Michael, 25, who was in town from Tampa, Fla. As African Americans, they said, they felt conflicted about the president’s call to side with Israel. They could not condone terrorist attacks, they said, but sympathized with Palestinians and what they see as the long discrimination they have endured.

“There are times when I sit in the middle, because I can see both sides of it,” Janet Lucas said. “And then I also think, is there another way, could the United States or any other country get involved to help them to come to some form of peace?”"
177,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/us/politics/bidens-funds-israel-ukraine.html,"President Biden has argued that American aid for crises overseas, primarily in Ukraine and Israel, is vital to protecting U.S. national security. On Friday, he laid out the details of what he believes the United States needs to provide to its allies.

Here is a look at what is in the Biden administration’s $105 billion funding request:

$61.4 billion for Ukraine

More than half of that money would go toward providing weapons and ammunition for Ukraine via defense contracts and U.S. stockpiles, which the funds would then replenish. The rest would pay for economic and operational assistance, intelligence and military logistical support, nuclear security programs and resettling Ukrainian refugees.

$14.3 billion for Israel

The package would go almost entirely toward defense contracts and facilitating the transfer of weapons and ammunition to Israel from U.S. stockpiles. According to the White House, ammunition for the missile defense systems known as Iron Dome and David’s Sling, as well as Iron Beam, Israel’s ground-based laser air defense system, would be covered in the package. Congressional leaders have said the package will also include precision-guided munitions, kits that turn regular bombs into precision weapons and artillery shells.

$13.6 billion for border security

The money would pay for more border patrol officers, immigration judges, shelters and detention centers; it also includes more than $1 billion for battling fentanyl trafficking. But it does not include two key initiatives that Republicans want: funding to construct a border wall and changes to the way migrants seeking asylum are allowed into the country."

During Israel’s 2008-9 war on Gaza, three of his daughters were killed when an Israeli tank struck their home. This time, I had to offer my condolences again, when he told me about the recent deaths of more than 25 members of his extended family in Gaza. Among them, he said, were five babies.

In his declaration of war on Gaza on Oct. 7, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel quoted a line from a poem by the Jewish writer Chaim Nachman Bialik. “Revenge for the blood of a little child has yet been devised by Satan,” Mr. Netanyahu posted on social media.

Perhaps the prime minister forgot what Bialik wrote just one line before that: “And cursed be he who cries out: Revenge.” Or the next lines: “Let the blood fill the abyss!/let it pierce the blackest depths.”

These days I find myself asking what the poet meant by this. Bialik wrote it after learning of the horrors of the 1903 Kishinev pogrom."

“When rockets are fired from Gaza, and you need to find shelter, people in Tel Aviv have a few minutes,” said the professor, Hila Riemer. “Here, we have one.”

Ben-Gurion University, one of Israel’s top research institutions, is that close to Gaza — 25 miles away.

When the unprecedented bloodshed exploded out of Gaza last weekend and Hamas gunmen slaughtered more than 1,300 Israelis, the entire country was shaken to its core and this university was immediately sucked into the conflict."
180,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-war.html,"As Israeli forces massed along the border with Gaza on Sunday ahead of an expected ground invasion, escalating clashes on Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, as well as strikes in Syria and in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, intensified fears of a widening regional conflict.

Leaders from nearly every party involved ratcheted up their warnings, and many urged civilians to move out of the way. Israel dropped leaflets telling Palestinians to leave northern Gaza, and relocated Israelis living along the border with Lebanon. The United States ordered some diplomatic personnel to leave Iraq. Lebanese civilians have also fled their villages, fearing Israeli shelling and the possibility of a new war.

Israel’s military said on Sunday that increasing attacks from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia that controls southern Lebanon, had resulted in civilian and military casualties. Israel said it was moving residents from an additional 14 villages near the border with Lebanon to safer areas, an expansion of its evacuation plan.

While visiting Israeli troops on the border with Lebanon, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that if Hezbollah decided to join the war, it would result in “devastating consequences to Hezbollah and the state of Lebanon.”

“We’ll hit it with a force it can’t even imagine,” he said.

A Hezbollah lawmaker, Hassan Fadlallah, claimed in a news conference that the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was directly overseeing the clashes on Lebanon’s border with Israel, adding that ​​when “the battle requires his appearance, he will do so.”

The escalating violence in the region came just over two weeks after hundreds of Hamas gunmen in Gaza surged across the border into Israel, killing more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians. Israel on Sunday updated the number of hostages that Hamas is holding in Gaza to 212 from 210. Hamas released an Israeli-American mother and daughter on Friday."
181,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-war.html,"Israel called for the evacuation of more than a million citizens from the northern Gaza Strip and concentrated more armed forces around the enclave on Friday, signaling that it may be preparing to escalate the war with Hamas.

The United Nations and international aid and rights groups called Israel’s directive unworkable or unlawful, and urged it to rescind the evacuation. A U.N. spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, said in a statement that the evacuation could not be conducted “without devastating humanitarian consequences,” and “could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation.”

The Israeli military did not back away from the evacuation plan on Friday but softened its stance, suggesting there was no deadline, after initially saying that people should leave northern Gaza within 24 hours. “We understand it will take time,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesman, told reporters.

In Gaza, already cut off from vital supplies, many people fled with what they could carry, not knowing what conditions awaited them in the south or how long they would be gone. But many others remained, out of necessity, fear or defiance. Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza and conducted a deadly, large-scale incursion into Israel last weekend, has urged people to stay put, calling the Israeli directive “psychological warfare.”"
182,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/opinion/israel-gaza-palestine-children.html,"What are we to make of the Biden administration’s call for an additional $14 billion in assistance for Israel and simultaneous call for humanitarian aid for Gazans? Defensive weapons for Israel’s Iron Dome system would make sense, but in practice, is the idea that we will help pay for humanitarians to mop up the blood caused in part by our weapons?

What are we to tell Dr. Iyad Abu Karsh, a Gaza physician who lost his wife and son in a bombing and then had to treat his injured 2-year-old daughter? He didn’t even have time to care for his niece or sister, for he had to deal with the bodies of his loved ones.

“I have no time to talk now,” he told a Times colleague, his voice trembling over the phone. “I want to go bury them.”

In his speech on Thursday, Biden called for America to stand firmly behind Ukraine and Israel, two nations attacked by forces aiming to destroy them. Fair enough. But suppose Ukraine responded to Russian war crimes by laying siege to a Russian city, bombing it into dust and cutting off water and electricity while killing thousands and obliging doctors to operate on patients without anesthetic.

I doubt we Americans would shrug and say: Well, Putin started it. Too bad about those Russian children, but they should have chosen somewhere else to be born.

Here in Israel, because the Hamas attacks were so brutal and fit into a history of pogroms and Holocaust, they led to a resolve to wipe out Hamas even if this means a large human toll. “Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist,” declared Giora Eiland, a former head of the Israeli National Security Council. “There is no other option for ensuring the security of the State of Israel.”

I think that view reflects a practical and moral miscalculation. While I would love to see the end of Hamas, it’s not feasible to eliminate radicalism in Gaza, and a ground invasion is more likely to feed extremism than to squelch it — at an unbearable cost in civilian lives.

I particularly want to challenge the suggestion, more implicit than explicit, that Gazan lives matter less because many Palestinians sympathize with Hamas. People do not lose their right to life because they have odious views, and in any case, almost half of Gazans are children. Those kids in Gaza, infants included, are among the more than two million people enduring a siege and collective punishment.

Israel has suffered a horrifying terrorist attack and deserves the world’s sympathy and support, but it should not get a blank check to slaughter civilians or to deprive them of food, water and medicine. Bravo to Biden for trying to negotiate some humanitarian access to Gaza, but the challenge will be not just getting aid into Gaza but also distributing it to where it’s needed.

A prolonged ground invasion seems to me a particularly risky course, likely to kill large numbers of Israeli soldiers, hostages and especially Gazan civilians. We are better than that, and Israel is better than that. Leveling cities is what the Syrian government did in Aleppo or Russia did in Grozny; it should not be an American-backed undertaking by Israel in Gaza.

The best answer to this test is to try even in the face of provocation to cling to our values. That means that despite our biases, we try to uphold all lives as having equal value. If your ethics see some children as invaluable and others as disposable, that’s not moral clarity but moral myopia. We must not kill Gazan children to try to protect Israeli children."

Since the devastating attack on Israel on Oct. 7 and Israel’s retaliatory strikes on Gaza, Palestinians have been protesting in many towns in the West Bank and clashing with Israeli soldiers.

On Thursday, Israeli forces staged simultaneous raids in Bethlehem, Hebron, Jericho, Nablus and Ramallah, searching for militants connected to Hamas, the armed Palestinian organization that carried out the Oct. 7 attack, which killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians.

Since then, Palestinian human rights groups say that more than 70 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank in clashes with Israeli forces and armed Israeli settlers, by far the most in any consecutive two weeks this year. Israeli officers have arrested hundreds of people, according to Palestinian and Israeli accounts; the Israeli military said on Friday that more than 375 people of those arrested are members of Hamas.

Television news footage broadcast on Thursday showed Israeli Army trucks chugging into Palestinian residential areas and soldiers running across alleyways under the cover of darkness.

Palestinian medics said that Israeli soldiers were blocking them from getting to wounded people. Arab news channels reported that some of wounded had died from loss of blood. Israeli officials could not be immediately reached for comment on the allegation.

United Nations officials said that they were increasingly concerned about the spiraling violence.

“We are extremely alarmed by the rapidly deteriorating human rights situation in the occupied West Bank and the increase in unlawful use of lethal force,” said Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the U.N. human rights chief, Volker Türk.

“Neutrality isn’t an option,” Mr. Wellman told the crowd, to murmurs of “Amen.” He traced the history of aggression and oppression against the Jewish people through ancient Egypt into the Roman Empire and then from Nazi Germany to the attacks on civilians last weekend by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, which he described as “acts conceived in the darkest pits of hell.”

American evangelicals are among Israel’s most ardent advocates, compelled in part by their interpretation of scripture that says God’s ancient promise to the Jewish people designating the region as their homeland is unbreakable. Some evangelicals also see Israel’s existence connected to biblical prophecy about the last days of the world before a divine theocratic kingdom can be established on earth.

Zelizer, a professor of political history at Princeton University, said of Mr. Biden’s handling of the war in Israel. “We live in an era now where polarization is so deep that no matter what the magnitude of the crisis is, or the performance of the president, it’s not likely to make a difference.”

Several voters interviewed on Friday were skeptical of Mr. Biden’s call to send $14 billion to help Israel — let alone another $60 billion for Ukraine.

Samantha Moskowitz, 27, a psychology student at Georgia Gwinnett College in the Atlanta suburbs, said the prospect of sending billions to Israel and Ukraine “makes me anxious, especially where our economy is right now.”

“I don’t love the idea that the money is being sent,” said Ms. Moskowitz, who did not vote for either Mr. Biden or Donald J. Trump in 2020 and said it was “too early to tell” if she would vote in 2024. “There is a need, but do we really need that significant amount?”

She said she did not watch Mr. Biden’s Oval Office address on Thursday.

About 20.3 million people watched Mr. Biden’s speech across 10 television networks, according to preliminary data from Nielsen. The total audience for the speech was certainly bigger, given that the Nielsen data does not capture some online viewing numbers.

When Mr. Trump spoke about immigration from the Oval Office in January 2019, about 40 million people tuned in. Just over 27 million people watched Mr. Biden’s State of the Union speech in February.

Stanley B. Greenberg, who was Mr. Clinton’s pollster in 1992, called Mr. Biden’s Oval Office address “a very important speech in terms of defining America’s security and bringing Iran and Russia to the forefront,” and predicted that it could help rally voters around the president and push Congress to pass his $106 billion international aid plan, which includes money for Ukraine and the Middle East.

“Of course, a year from now, voters will be voting on the cost of living, the economy, the border, crime and other issues,” he said. “Foreign policy is rarely a voting determinant, but President Biden may be leading the attack on isolation and a new partisan choice on how we gain security.”

The initial polling suggests that broad majorities of Americans endorse Mr. Biden’s staunch support for Israel. A Fox News poll found that 68 percent of voters sided with Israel, and 76 percent of voters in a Quinnipiac University poll said that supporting Israel was in the national interest of the United States.

With the exception of 2004, when President George W. Bush confronted rising criticism about having led the nation into war against Iraq, no national election has been driven by foreign policy since the end of the Vietnam War.

The nature of the presidential campaign could change if the conflict in Israel continues to dominate the news for weeks and months. Unlike the elder Mr. Bush after the 1991 Iraq war — which began and ended quickly with what at the time seemed a clear victory — Mr. Biden could be presenting himself as a wartime president through the course of his re-election bid, a prospect that also carries political risks.

Mr. Biden’s support for sending military aid to Israel, even accompanied by gentle pleas to the country’s leaders for restraint, has alienated many on the left wing of his party, who point to a high Palestinian death toll in Gaza that is likely to rise as Israel presses its offensive.

This week, thousands have marched on the Capitol amid a series of open letters — including one from a long roster of former presidential campaign staff members for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — demanding that Democratic lawmakers urge Mr. Biden to push for a cease-fire in Israel, which he is unlikely to do.

The president has picked sides in a conflict over which he has little control. Most immediately, Mr. Biden faces the challenge of what he can do to secure the release of Americans being held hostage in the Gaza Strip. Hamas released two American hostages on Friday afternoon, and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said that 10 more Americans had yet to be freed.

Dr. Zelizer said, “I think the assumption should be that things will go south and there will be detrimental effects.” Referring to Mr. Biden and his administration, he added, “There’s assistance, but they don’t have real control over how this unfolds.”

For all of those risks, these next few months may give Mr. Biden a window to shake up the contest in ways that could put him on firmer ground.

“It gives him an opportunity to change and strengthen his image,” said Charles R. Black Jr., a strategist for the presidential campaigns of both Bushes and Ronald Reagan. “It gives him a chance to demonstrate his strength and also his knowledge.”

Paul Begala, a Democratic consultant, said that this political moment could prompt voters to give Mr. Biden a second look. “The fear with an incumbent president is that voters write you off, they stop listening,” he said.

“What’s the biggest thing about Biden?” Mr. Begala added. “Old. This gives him a chance to lean into it. I don’t think people are going to vote on how he does in Israel. But I think this can let them reframe the age problem. It is a way for people to look and say, maybe it’s good we have the old guy in there. He is steady and strong.”

For Mr. Biden, an orderly handling of the crisis would be likely to buttress what is expected to be another dominant theme of his campaign if he finds himself running for a second time against Mr. Trump, with turmoil continuing among House Republicans as they seek to elect a speaker.

“Hopefully the House chaos will calm down long before the election,” Mr. Black said. “But Trump is so ad hoc on foreign policy that it’s always chaos.”

Aggravating the shock, Mr. Ben-David added, is that many of the reservists being called to serve in the military are tech entrepreneurs, teachers, lawyers and other secular Israelis, while ultra-Orthodox men are excused for religious reasons. That has concentrated the pool of recruits around people who make up the bulk of Israel’s entrepreneurial economic activity.

Two credit ratings agencies this week warned that Israel’s debt could be downgraded. On Friday Moody’s said that the conflict was “more severe than the episodes of violence in the last few decades,” creating the risk of a diversion of resources in the economy, decreased investment and a loss of confidence.

And the Fitch ratings agency warned on Tuesday of the “heightened risk of a widening of Israel’s current conflict to include large-scale military confrontations with multiple actors, over a sustained period of time.” Just six months ago, Fitch cited Israel’s “strong economic growth.” A ratings downgrade could force Israel to pay higher interest when it borrows.

Goldman Sachs said in a note Monday that the risks to Israel’s financial and economic stability appeared to be lower, for now, than during previous major conflicts because Israel’s overall finances were stronger today and the country had a large stock of foreign exchange reserves.

The Bank of Israel has about $200 billion in foreign exchange reserves — close to 40 percent of the country’s gross domestic product — which its governor, Amir Yaron, told I.M.F. and World Bank officials in a video call on Sunday provided ample capacity to support the economy. Since the conflict, the central bank has earmarked $30 billion in foreign exchange to support the shekel, which has fallen to an eight-year low."
187,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/opinion/israel-gaza-generations.html,"Yet there’s been an acute debate around this very question here in America in recent days.

Most Americans assess this conflict the way they do many others: at arm’s length and an ocean away. And they do so through the prism of their own sense of fairness and justice.

In this case, there is something of a partisan and generational schism, with some progressive Democrats and younger Americans more likely to express a greater degree of sympathy for the Palestinian people or at least less reflexive support for Israel, according to polls.

Many of those who share this view are part of what Elizabeth Alexander, a writer, poet and scholar and the president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, has called the Trayvon generation — young people who have come of age in the decade since the killing of Trayvon Martin in 2012. It’s a generation that has become highly attuned to intersectionality, the history and current expressions of various forms of oppression, and the ways in which colonialism, imperialism and capitalism undermine the concepts of equality and justice.

And just because the country as a whole seems to have turned the page on its fleeting interest, circa 2020, in the movement born of this generation of Americans, that doesn’t mean the impulses and understandings of members of this generation simply evaporate. Social and racial justice is still their compass. It is a part of who they are and how they think. And it is with that compass that many of them evaluate the broader dispute over Israel’s control of the occupied territories and the immediate conflict between Israel and Hamas.

I think it would be a great mistake to bemoan the position taken by many of these young people — the seekers of context, not the defenders of terrorism, of course — rather than seek to understand it."

On Monday, Israel’s military and its defense ministry said it would evacuate 28 communities that are within two kilometers (1.2 miles) of the Lebanese border.

The border has been a longtime staging ground for attacks by Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese group that has fought wars with Israel in the past. On Sunday, Hezbollah claimed responsibility for an attack that day in Israel that killed at least one civilian.

On Friday, Issam Abdallah, a Reuters video journalist, was killed in southern Lebanon after missiles launched from the direction of Israel struck him. Six other journalists — from Reuters, Al Jazeera and Agence France-Presse — were also injured in the attack, which occurred near the village of Alma al-Shaab."

Long considered a brutal enforcer within Hamas and an implacable enemy of Israel, Mr. Sinwar served more than two decades in Israeli prisons before being released in a 2011 prisoner swap. He emerged as the militant group’s leader in Gaza — its top leadership resides abroad — in 2017.

“Yahya Sinwar is the face of evil,” Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, said on Saturday after Hamas assailants killed more than 1,300 Israelis in a brutal incursion that began Oct. 7. “He is the mastermind behind this, like bin Laden was.”

That promise would set the tone for much of Ms. Haley’s time at the U.N. Over her nearly two-year tenure, she transformed herself from a foreign policy novice to a blunt-talking stateswoman, making the defense of Israel her defining cause.

Ms. Haley blocked a Palestinian envoy’s appointment and took credit for forcing the withdrawal of a report that described the Israeli government’s treatment of Palestinians as “apartheid.” She walked out of a Security Council meeting during a Palestinian official’s speech and criticized the U.N.’s Palestinian refugee aid program, which she has since said “uses American money to feed Palestinian hatred of the Jewish state.”

She was an enthusiastic face of the Trump administration’s diplomatic largess toward Israel, and described herself as turning back the tide of “Israel-bashing” at the world body.

Denizens of the U.N.’s New York headquarters began joking that Israel now had two ambassadors.

American ambassadors have generally stood with Israel at the U.N., but observers of Ms. Haley’s time there saw something new in her often confrontational advocacy for the Trump administration’s no-questions support for Mr. Netanyahu’s government."
191,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/opinion/israel-gaza-iraq-iran.html,"The self-defeating mind-set that took hold in the United States not long after Iraq’s occupation was that the decision to invade Iraq was an original sin — something so wrong that it could never have come out better than it did. That mentality is damaging because it cuts off any serious effort to understand what went wrong and why.

The label of “forever wars” that has been firmly attached to America’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan fails to acknowledge that poor planning and scant resources will always fail to secure postwar peace. It astounds me that anyone could be surprised by this. But the lessons of postwar Germany and Japan that led to their prosperous democracies today, including well-resourced physical and political reconstruction and the time to succeed, were utterly misunderstood and misapplied by Washington in 2003 and 2004. Israel has faced its own forever war since 1948. Poor planning and scant resources are also your enemy.

Just as Iraqis rightly told us before the 2003 invasion that Iraq is not Afghanistan, Gaza is neither Iraq nor Afghanistan. Factors unique to Gaza, such as decades of Hamas’s anti-Israeli and anti-Jewish propaganda and Israel’s treatment of Gazan civilians since 1967, will make both physical and political rebuilding especially challenging to Israel and even more challenging than southern Lebanon was to Israel from 1985 to 2000. The deep-seated hatred that many Gazans have for Israel today has no parallel to what U.S. forces faced entering Kabul or Baghdad. Anything Israel touches in a post-Hamas polity in Gaza risks becoming toxic; you must plan for this. Your plans need to understand what Gaza needs and to recognize that the government of Israel may not be the best means to deliver that.

Plan for the length of time you will need to bring about the fundamental changes that will break the cycle of violence Israel and Gaza have inflicted on each other over the past 50-plus years — not the time politicians think you will need. One reason the State Department’s best postwar plan for Iraq, which has still never been made public, was rejected by the White House was that Pentagon officials argued that a three-year timeline was too long. Decision makers opted for the siren song of one year or less and vastly inadequate physical or political reconstruction money, without regard for the reality that fast and cheap was doomed to fail. Instead, the United States expended more in blood and treasure from 2003 to 2011 and ended up strategically worse off than if a better postwar plan had been given the resources and time needed upfront. A repeat of Israel’s 15-year occupation of southern Lebanon is neither realistic nor desirable, but neither is the more recent pattern of quick ground incursions followed by withdrawals, or what’s called mowing the grass.

Finally, remember that military victory is an asset whose power decreases over time. If and when Israel succeeds in defeating Hamas, use that limited time wisely. What you decide to prioritize may be all you get done, so it has to lay the groundwork for constructive steps, not chaos, to follow. Recovery from disastrous decisions at the outset — like the U.S. decisions to disband the Iraqi Army and to fire tens of thousands more Baath Party members than necessary from their government jobs, thus largely creating the Sunni insurgency — is almost impossible."

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled south, but nowhere is safe across the Gaza Strip and a fast-growing humanitarian crisis has erupted as a result of Israel blocking food, water and fuel from entering the territory.

Nearly half of Gaza’s population of more than two million has been displaced over the past week, according to UNRWA, the U.N. agency that aids Palestinians."

194,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/15/opinion/israel-united-states-gaza.html,"Israel has ordered more than a million people to leave northern Gaza, presumably to prepare for an imminent ground offensive. Its military strategists appear to be planning the depopulation and reoccupation of at least part of an area home to around 2.3 million people — nearly half of them children — and most of them descended from people driven from their homes before and during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. We must understand that these are human beings at grave risk, not just numbers.

Consider what some in the Israeli defense establishment have said.

“The State of Israel has no choice but to turn Gaza into a place that is temporarily or permanently impossible to live in,” a reservist major general, Giora Eiland, wrote in Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper. “Creating a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza is a necessary means to achieve the goal.” He added, “Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist.” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said, “We are fighting human animals, and we are acting accordingly.” Maj. Gen. Ghassan Alian declared that in Gaza, “there will be no electricity and no water. There will only be destruction. You wanted hell; you will get hell.”

The depopulation of Gaza would be manifestly inhumane and a violation of international law. President Biden and his advisers should ask themselves how it can be in the national interest of the United States to allow another mass expulsion of Palestinians from their homes. Such a cataclysm would be a second nakba, or catastrophe, as the displacement of 1948 is called. The United States would thereby be a partner with Israel in creating a future for the Palestinians that offers only periodic death, destruction and dispossession and permanent subjugation or expulsion.

Israeli forces have attacked Gaza six times from 2006 until the recent siege, killing well over 4,000 people. According to the Jerusalem-based human rights watchdog B’Tselem, that figure includes 405 in 2006, 1,391 in 2008 and 2009, 167 in 2012, 2,203 in 2014, 232 in 2021 and 33 in 2022. Each time, casualties for Palestinian civilians have outnumbered combatants."
195,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/us/politics/biden-aid-israel-ukraine-taiwan-border.html,"President Biden on Friday delivered to Congress a $105 billion request for military aid, mostly for Israel and Ukraine, essentially daring lawmakers who oppose parts of the proposal to vote against an overall package that he said will ensure “American security for generations.”

Mr. Biden is betting that Republicans who oppose more aid to Ukraine will not vote against legislation that also includes more than $14 billion to help Israel defend itself against terror attacks from Hamas. And he is hoping that progressive Democrats who do not want to support Israel’s military operations will not vote against additional aid for Ukraine.

Also included in the request are billions of dollars to bolster security along the U.S.-Mexico border, security aid for Taiwan and a fund for humanitarian assistance in hot spots around the world.

The legislative gamble is playing out against a global split screen: wars are raging in Europe and the Middle East, while in the United States, the House has been in a state of chaos for more than two weeks as Republicans struggle to select a speaker."
196,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/world/middleeast/hamas-hostage-video-israel.html,"“I just ask that I am returned as fast as possible to my family, to my parents, and to my siblings,” she says. “Please get us out of here as quickly as possible.”

The Israeli military issued a statement after the video was released that said Hamas was “trying to portray itself as a humane organization, while it is a murderous terrorist organization responsible for the murder and abduction of babies, women, children and elderly.”

A friend of the Schem family said the family had seen the clip and confirmed Ms. Schem’s identity. The friend requested anonymity, citing fears of harassment. The family name can also be transliterated as Shem.

According to an analysis by The New York Times, metadata contained within the video file indicates that some of the footage was filmed at least six days ago.

Israeli officials said on Monday that 199 people were being held captive by Hamas — about 50 more than previously known — in the wake of the attack, which left more than 1,400 victims dead. Israel has responded with heavy airstrikes on Gaza, the Palestinian enclave controlled by Hamas, and threats of a ground invasion. Hamas has claimed that at least some captives have been killed in the strikes, a claim impossible to independently verify."
197,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/us/politics/doug-emhoff-antisemitism-israel.html,"Doug Emhoff has spent the weeks after the Hamas attack on Israel acting as a touchstone for some of the anguish, fear and anger felt by Jewish Americans.

Mr. Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris and the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president, stood beside President Biden and condemned the attacks as terrorism. He met with Natalie Sanandaji, an American survivor of the assault. He visited Jewish schoolchildren, some of whom recently arrived from Israel, and told them they should not be afraid.

“Just know that I have your back,” he told a group of first and second graders last week. “And we’re always going to be there for you. I promise.”

From his second-floor office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Mr. Emhoff has used his faith to bring focus to a role that he is the first in American history to hold. He has largely left the politics to others, instead focusing on providing comfort, reassurance and solidarity to people in pain.

Recent federal data has showed that antisemitism is rising in the United States, as well as hate crime overall. Black Americans and Muslims are also disproportionately represented among victims. In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Emhoff was asked whether he could use his role — one that is powerful but a world away from the presidency — to help change those numbers.

“We have to try,” said Mr. Emhoff, who keeps an action figure of the woman he calls “my wife, the vice president” in his office.

“There’s an epidemic of hate, and it’s not just against Jewish people, and it’s really corrosive, and it impacts our democracy and our way of life and our safety. I’m going to do everything I can, and I know the administration will,” he said.

Just after the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, Mr. Emhoff stood beside the president and addressed a group of Jewish leaders who had assembled in the Indian Treaty Room.

“I know you are hurting,” Mr. Emhoff, who is 59, told the crowd, some of whom were wiping their eyes. “The entire Jewish community is hurting. I’m hurting.”

Speaking next, the president promised the group that his administration was working to return American hostages, and told them that he had urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to “operate by the rules of war.”"
198,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/15/world/middleeast/israel-ukraine-aid-biden-congress.html,"The Biden administration is pushing for Congress to take up an emergency assistance package that would pair support for Ukraine and Israel, according to a senior White House official and multiple lawmakers.

“The president has made clear that he is going to go to Congress with a package of funding for Ukraine as well as continued support for Israel,” Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

Last month, Congress let lapse the emergency funds it had been sending to Ukraine for its war with Russia, amid dwindling Republican support for such assistance. In contrast, Hamas’s deadly raid last weekend prompted a sweeping bipartisan outcry for similar assistance to Israel. The decision to tie aid for Ukraine to aid for Israel reflects the urgency of both conflicts — and a calculation that Republicans who would otherwise be loath to send more money to Ukraine may feel bound to approve such a package to support Israel.

Speaking in Tel Aviv on Sunday, Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, promised to put an aid package to a floor vote in the next few weeks."
199,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/opinion/israel-gaza-war-ukraine.html,"For the last two years, the debate over the American commitment to Ukraine has turned, in part, on whether we are endangering our ability to contain China in the Pacific if we pour too many resources into a trench war against Russia. From the hawkish perspective, the argument has been that any such trade-off is overstated or nonexistent — because Russia and China are allies, and when we weaken Russia we weaken both, because the kinds of military equipment necessary to defend Taiwan differ from the kinds we’re sending to Ukraine, because surely America has the resources to fight authoritarianism on two fronts.

The Middle East has not factored substantially into this debate. But with the massacres in Israel and the unfolding Israeli assault on Gaza, we have a new front of engagement for American power, a new demand for U.S. resources, a new stress point for our stressed imperium and new risks of a wider war.

With this new challenge, the Ukraine hawks’ answer is the same: “The False Choice Between Ukraine and Israel” runs the headline of a Wall Street Journal editorial. And the Journal editors are correct in the narrow sense that the United States should not simply cut off Ukraine tomorrow and redirect that aid to Israel, as Senator Josh Hawley recently suggested. Our interest in restraining Russian ambitions does not dissolve the instant a Middle Eastern ally goes to war.

But in a larger sense, of course there are real strategic choices here, potential trade-offs in hardware shipped and dollars delivered; indeed, The Journal concedes as much when it urges the United States to embrace “a generational effort to produce more ammo and expand its arsenal.” (Whether such an effort is likely to emerge from the current chaos on Capitol Hill I leave to the reader to judge.)"

Blinken is in the middle of his most intense trip as the top American diplomat, traveling to at least seven countries across the Middle East in four days to shore up support for Israel as it wages war against Hamas.

During a whirlwind tour, at times guarded by security officers wearing body armor, the secretary of state broadcast several U.S. messages at once. He made clear that the United States fully supports Israel’s counterattack in response to Hamas’s cross-border incursion, which killed more than 1,300 people.

He sought to persuade Arab countries to limit their criticism — no easy task as devastating Israeli strikes have killed about 1,900 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.

Mr. Blinken and his top aides also spoke with their hosts about efforts to free hostages Hamas was holding in Gaza, including what U.S. officials say may be some American citizens abducted from Israel on Saturday. And he tried to ensure that the conflict did not widen to draw in other enemies of Israel, such as Iran or the Lebanon-based militia Hezbollah."

patrick kingsley I’m very sorry about what happened, first of all. Second of all, can you tell me how it started? amir tibon Yes. Yes. My wife and I and our two daughters live in Kibbutz Nahal Oz, which is a beautiful community on the border with Gaza. And we were very proud, and still are, to be members of this community. Yesterday morning, at 6:00 AM, we heard a whistle, and we realized that bombs are falling. We are very attuned to these kinds of things. And actually, in every house in our community, there is what we call a safe room, which is a room that is built of very strong concrete and has a special kind of door that is supposed to withstand the fall of mortars and rockets. And that’s usually where the children sleep. So we just ran to the safe room, closed the window, closed the door. And we just wait for it to be over. But then, we started hearing gunfire. Gunfire, very close. And it became closer and closer. And that’s when we realized we were in a different kind of event. And we realized that there are terrorists inside our neighborhood. And at some point, outside our window, we could hear them talk. We could hear them run. We could hear them shooting their guns at our house, at our windows. There was no military anywhere in sight. And at that moment, we realized that we are here alone. We are gonna have to stay in there and pray, basically. I have to say, my daughters were real heroes. Our oldest is 3 and 1/2 years old, and our younger is a year and a half. We told them they have to be quiet. And so for nine hours, my girls have not eaten anything. They have not gotten out of the safe room. We have no electricity. We have no phone. We have no light. And around 3:30, I think it was — this is 9.5 hours into the ordeal — we heard a big bang on the concrete window. And we heard my father say, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH], I’m here. patrick kingsley Mm. amir tibon We opened the door, finally, and he came in with this group of soldiers. We hugged them. They hugged us. Then, the difficult part began. They started bringing into our house families that could no longer stay in theirs — wounded people, people who don’t know where their loved ones are, people who heard terrorists walking inside their house — something that did not happen to us and I think is way more traumatic. Everybody was gathered in our house. And you saw all the pain of the people and the fear of the children. This went on for several hours. And in the middle of the night, the soldiers organized the bus, came and took all of us, including my father, now with us, out of the kibbutz. I have to say we are very, very angry and disappointed. We felt alone. We’re crying for help, and nobody came. And when we were sitting there with the girls and hearing the Hamas cell outside our window, my wife told me, this is the Yom Kippur War of our lives. This is the Yom Kippur War of our generation.

sabrina tavernise

From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise, and this is “The Daily.” Over the weekend, Palestinian militants launched a stunning and highly coordinated invasion of Israel, rampaging through Israeli towns, killing people in their homes and on the streets, and taking hostages. Today, my colleague, Isabel Kirshner, on the biggest attack against Israel in 50 years and the all-out war that it has now prompted. [MUSIC PLAYING] It’s Monday, October 9. So Isabel, we all woke up Saturday morning to this unbelievable news that there had been this massive attack on Israel. And over the course of the day, I was absolutely glued to my phone and to your dispatches, trying to understand what on Earth was happening. You know, this is not something we really ever see — an attack on this scale on Israeli territory. How did the day start for you?

isabel kershner

Well, I was woken up by a phone call, probably about an hour into the beginning of the attack, which began with rocket fire. And honestly, there was such a fog of what exactly was happening at the time. It really took most of the day for details to emerge. But as the hours unfolded, it became clear that this was a hugely coordinated invasion of Israel, carried out by militants from the Gaza Strip, which is a Palestinian territory adjacent to Israel. And the militants were from Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls the Gaza Strip. And those militants broke easily through the fortifications on the border, reaching more than 10 miles into Israeli territory, taking over houses, taking over whole villages, coming by air, land, and sea. And as the events unfolded and the day went on, it became clear that this was the broadest, biggest invasion of Israeli territory in 50 years.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so let’s start to unpack this. When did it begin, and how did it begin?

isabel kershner

So it began at about 6:30 in the morning. It was a Saturday, the day of the Sabbath here, when most people would have been asleep. It was also a Jewish holiday of Sukkot, Simhat Torah, which is usually a very festive day, which caps the High Holy Days of the autumn season. And people had really been gearing up for a nice weekend and woke up to barrages of rocket fire — [SIRENS BLARING] — sirens going off all over the country. They were going off in Tel Aviv. They were going off in Central Jerusalem. [GUNSHOTS] As the morning went on —

[yelling, car honking]

There were scenes emerging, on TV and social media, of tractors just crashing through the border fence on the Gaza border. We saw columns of vehicles speeding through, with nobody there to stop them. They were headed to the communities along the border — villages, kibbutzim, and small cooperative villages. [GUNSHOTS] Once they reached these communities and towns, they literally went house to house and started knocking on doors or shooting their way in.

And we’re talking here about families, grandparents, people with young children. And then it began to emerge —

[yelling, honking]

— that there had also been an all-night rave, not far from the Gaza border.

archived recording 5 Whoever tried to run away, they were shooting him from both sides.

isabel kershner

And there were about 2,000 young Israelis who’d spent the night there, and then found themselves surrounded by gunmen —

archived recording 6 The terrorists, they took out people from the car and just gunned them down.

isabel kershner

— shooting into their cars, shooting at them as they ran on foot.

archived recording 7 All the way, people were dying, all the way on the road — young people. So best were to hide.

isabel kershner

There were people hiding in bushes and among the trees for hours in this open rural area, being hunted by these gunmen. [RADIO CHATTER]

[yelling in non-english]

isabel kershner

And it appears that both in the villages along the Gaza border and at the rave, the militants were picking up sometimes injured Israelis and, in many cases, uninjured Israelis and just taking them into Gaza as hostages.

[yelling, screaming]

There were whole families. There were young couples. There were elderly people. This was a stunning and shocking scenario, a nightmare scenario for Israelis. [MUSIC PLAYING] [EXPLOSIONS] Very soon after the rocket fire of Saturday morning and the invasion of the gunmen, the Israeli military puts planes in the sky and starts to strike in Gaza, across the Gaza Strip. And the government says it’s trying to target cells and launching pads where the rockets are being fired from. But we know the strikes are deadly and often inflict casualties on Palestinian civilians there. And soon after that —

sabrina tavernise

So this is just an extraordinary attack on so many levels — historic and a complete shock. Do we have any sense of how this happened? How was Hamas able to pull this off?

isabel kershner

Well, that’s the big question that everybody here is now asking. Because this was a complete surprise. Israel was caught completely off-guard. It’s not clear how Hamas did this, but there are hints that — from Israeli officials now, that there’s been some Iranian help. We know that Iran has given logistical support to Hamas for years, and Hamas has just grown in sophistication, in terms of its military machine. We’ve seen, over the years, its rockets reaching further and further into Israel, but nothing on a scale like this. Because this was clearly such a well-planned and coordinated and multi-pronged attack. And how that could have all happened without Israel noticing is the question that everybody here is now asking.

sabrina tavernise

Well, let’s talk about that. Do we have a sense yet of how Israel didn’t see this coming?

isabel kershner

Well, first of all, people are baffled, because Israel has such a vaunted intelligence apparatus. You know, so much has been invested in that border fence in the fortifications. For years, Israel was building a multi-billion shekel barrier that reaches underground in order to stop Hamas militants or other militant groups coming into Israeli territory through underground tunnels. This is an incredibly sophisticated structure with sensors, cameras. It’s being watched all the time. There are usually blimps in the air. I mean, the fact that this was happening all along the fence and that these forces, heavily armed forces, were just driving straight through overland, not underground, and reaching miles into Israeli territory, and nobody was there to stop them — I mean, this was just an incredible failure. Israel was caught totally off-guard. Many people here are saying Israel just took its eye off the ball. And in fact, the focus of the last few months for the military has been the West Bank, the occupied West Bank, which is the other major territory with a population of millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers living among them, and where we’ve seen bursts of violence and increasing friction over the last few months. And so they just didn’t see this coming.

sabrina tavernise

So they were totally blindsided.

isabel kershner

Absolutely. Absolutely. And the shock of Saturday’s events is now reverberating in Israel and throughout the region. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. Isabel, this attack just happened, and you’re still sorting through the details. But I think the question many of us have at this point is, why now? Why did Hamas attack Israel from Gaza now?

isabel kershner

Well, we don’t exactly know. But Gaza has long presented a challenge for Israel on its border. Gaza is a narrow strip of land with 2 million Palestinians living there. Many of them are refugees and the descendants of refugees from what was Palestine before the state of Israel was founded, and the place has been under blockade by Israel and neighboring Egypt for the last 16 years, ever since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip. So Gaza has long been compared by many to an open-air prison, and frustration has just been growing up there for years and years. But when you ask why now, there have been shifts in the broader region. For years, many of the Arab states refused to recognize or have diplomatic relations with Israel until Israel and the Palestinians had found some resolution to their conflict. But we’ve seen that beginning to change. So in 2020, we saw several Arab countries deciding that they would normalize relations with Israel, while basically bypassing the Palestinians. And now, in the last few weeks, we’ve seen increasingly open declarations that Saudi Arabia, which is the big player in the region in this respect, is moving closer and closer to a normalization deal with Israel. And this is something that would be very threatening to Hamas and to the Palestinians in general, who may fear being left behind.

sabrina tavernise

And I assume this attack and Israel’s declaration of war makes it more complicated for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel. I mean, this deal could be a tough sell for Saudi leaders if Israel is in an all-out war with Palestinians in Gaza.

isabel kershner

Sure. I mean, the future path is now very unclear, but that could certainly be the case.

sabrina tavernise

So that’s one potential motivation — preventing a deal between Israel and the Saudis. But we know Hamas isn’t entirely alone in the region. It has a strong backer, and that’s Iran. How might Iran factor in here?

isabel kershner

Well, Iran would be no fan of this emerging Saudi deal with Israel, which is intended to strengthen the anti-Iranian axis in the region. Iran and Saudi Arabia are absolute rivals. And in fact, what we’ve seen now is the Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi calling Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, and expressing his appreciation for Saturday’s invasion of Israeli territory. And he’s quoted in a statement as saying, you have made the Islamic nation happy with this initiative.

sabrina tavernise

I mean, one thing that’s really remarkable here is that this attack comes at a moment of real upheaval inside Israel. Right? We’ve been covering this on the show. There have been rolling political crises about the future of the judiciary in the country, but that’s brought around a real soul-searching among Israelis. And at times, it’s brought the country to a standstill. There have these rolling strikes. People are out on the streets. Do we know if this played a role in the timing of this attack?

isabel kershner

Well, it’s a really interesting question. It could very well be that Hamas looked at what was going on in Israel and all the upheaval and thought that this might be a good time to take Israel on. Because Israel appeared to be weak. This upheaval, the rifts in Israeli society, over the far-right government’s plans to curb the judiciary have actually reached all the way into the army. And we’ve seen thousands of Israeli reservists who’ve been threatening and declaring in recent months that they would not show up for duty as volunteers any more, because they felt that this government was undermining the democratic system that they had signed up to defend. But actually, what we’ve seen in the last 24 hours or 36 hours is an incredible turnaround. Because we’ve seen the country putting its differences aside, at least temporarily, to deal with what many here see as a dire national emergency. And we’ve seen the protest groups calling on the reservists to show up, and the military has been telling me that actually, in the callup of the reserves, they’ve had no refusals. And I spoke to one of the leaders of the reservists who had been protesting against the government. And he said to me, of course, I’ve shown up for duty. This is a time of a national emergency, and defending the citizens comes first.

sabrina tavernise

Interesting. So just a remarkable turnaround. I mean, something we couldn’t have imagined just weeks ago.

isabel kershner

Right.

sabrina tavernise

What about the political class and what’s happening in high politics?

isabel kershner

So even there, we’re seeing now the leaders of the centrist opposition parties who had vowed just weeks ago never to sit in a government with Benjamin Netanyahu, actually proposing forming a national unity government with him, an emergency government, to see Israel through this crisis. So if Hamas had thought that it was taking advantage of Israel’s weakest moment, or one of its weakest moments, perhaps they will find that this has backfired.

sabrina tavernise

So Isabel, stepping back for a minute here, this is really a defining moment for Israel. As you said earlier, on Saturday morning, Netanyahu made a declaration of war. What has he done since then?

isabel kershner

So late Saturday night —

archived recording (benjamin netanyahu) [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

isabel kershner

— there was a meeting of the security cabinet.

archived recording 8 The first objective is to clear out enemy forces and restore security. The second is to exact an immense price from the enemy, and the third —

isabel kershner

And in the early hours of Sunday morning, the government put out a statement in which it said it was going to cut off power, electricity that it supplies to the Gaza Strip, as well as fuel and goods. [EXPLOSIONS] Israel has continued with a relentless campaign of airstrikes. [EXPLOSIONS] It’s now struck hundreds of targets within the Gaza Strip.

archived recording 9 Entire apartment buildings, homes, schools, and even a mosque —

isabel kershner

It’s taken down multi-story buildings there, and of course, warned Gaza residents to move out of certain areas and neighborhoods. Many people there have nowhere to go. [CROWDS YELLING] And so there is a huge amount of panic on the ground.

archived recording 10 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] archived recording (interpreter) We, like everyone here, are being oppressed under the fire, the bombing, all night long. This building — 80 families lived here.

isabel kershner

And we’re seeing the death tolls on both sides rising. And now, we’re seeing the army evacuating the residents of the Israeli communities along the Gaza border, which is possibly an indication of a much larger offensive to come. And that leads to the next question, of whether Israel is planning to go into Gaza with its ground forces.

sabrina tavernise

Do you think that’s a serious risk? I mean, what are the chances Israel will actually invade the Gaza Strip?

isabel kershner

Well, we don’t know. But if you listen to Netanyahu’s words, he has said that all the sites in Gaza where Hamas is deployed and is hiding and is operating from — he said, we will turn them into rubble. He has told the Gazans, leave now, because we will operate forcefully everywhere. And I think you can’t rule out, listening to those words, that Israel will go as far as it feels it needs to go to achieve its goals.

sabrina tavernise

Isabel, thank you.

Thank you, Sabrina.

202,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/world/middleeast/islamic-jihad-gaza-hospital-israel.html,"Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group based in Gaza, was blamed by the Israel Defense Forces on Tuesday night after hundreds of people were reported killed by a strike at Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City.

The Israeli military said the blast was caused by a rocket fired by the group that failed after launching. The Gazan health authorities said the blast had been caused by an Israeli airstrike.

What is Islamic Jihad?

The second-largest armed group in Gaza, Islamic Jihad has often been eclipsed by the larger Hamas organization, which has controlled and governed Gaza since 2007.

Islamic Jihad was founded in the 1980s in the Gaza Strip to fight the Israeli occupation and maintains a presence in Gaza and the West Bank."
203,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/world/middleeast/schumer-israel-aid-hamas.html,"The Senate will vote early next week on a bipartisan resolution condemning Hamas’s strikes on Israel and pledging to support the Jewish state’s war effort, said Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, who is spending the weekend meeting with Israeli officials to discuss the contours of a future assistance package.

“I’m very hopeful we can pass that by unanimous consent,” Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said of the resolution. When it comes to putting an actual aid package for Israel on the Senate floor, Mr. Schumer said he wanted to consult first with Israeli officials, but “I think the sooner, the better.”

Over the weekend, Mr. Schumer and four other senators — Democrats Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Republicans Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mitt Romney of Utah — are expected to meet with a raft of senior Israeli administration officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Benny Gantz, who joined with Mr. Netanyahu to form a unity government earlier this week.

The group is also expected to meet with Israelis and Americans who lost loved ones during Hamas’s bloody attack on civilian settlements and military bases last weekend, which killed an estimated 1,300 Israelis. Mr. Schumer said he was shaken, angry and disturbed by the events, and as Congress’s first Jewish majority leader, felt “a passion and an obligation” to make the trip."
204,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/world/middleeast/israel-volunteer-unity.html,"The message popped up at 10:55 a.m. on Thursday: “Looking for volunteers to help unload a truck of equipment for soldiers. We are at the Museum of Tolerance. Come, there is nobody here.”

Barely four minutes after the note appeared in the 1,000-member WhatsApp group for volunteers in the Jerusalem area, Hadas Duchan showed up and got to work dismantling crates of thermal underwear, fleece jackets, hats and other gear procured by an American nonprofit organization.

“It helps you get over your feelings of helplessness,” said Ms. Duchan, 34, an artist whose two brothers are among the 360,000 reservists recently mobilized by Israel’s military after the Hamas terrorist attacks Saturday that left at least 1,200 dead.

As Israel signals that a ground invasion of Gaza could come any day, its shocked and traumatized citizens are pouring their anxious energy into raising funds and collecting goods for those in need: soldiers; survivors of the atrocities; hospitals treating the thousands of wounded; and people whose loved ones were killed, are still missing or are being held hostage in Gaza."

From “The New York Times,” I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” For years, Israel’s leaders believed that they could coexist with Hamas. After this weekend’s massacre, that belief is over. Today, my colleague Steven Erlanger on Israel’s plan to destroy Hamas and what it will mean for Palestinians and Israelis. It’s Wednesday, October 11. Steve, we wanted to talk to you because you have been a longtime student of and journalist of the Middle East, Israel, and the Palestinian people. You know this story very well. And we want you to help make sense of Israel’s pledge delivered over the past few days to destroy Hamas over the attacks it carried out over the weekend. And I want to start by having you explain what had been Israel’s relationship with Hamas before those attacks?

steven erlanger

Well, first, let’s remember that Hamas is a Palestinian armed group. It was a branch of what Israel originally considered moderate Muslim Brotherhood. Hamas began in the ‘80s as part of a kind of charity group. / did a lot of social aid. They had very well-educated people. They had doctors. But as time went on, Hamas, which is dedicated to the destruction of Israel, which on religious basis says Israel has no right to exist, that all Israeli citizens are soldiers, that they’re interlopers into holy Muslim lands, turned more and more toward violence. And Hamas then became more involved with the struggle of Palestinians against Israeli occupation —

archived recording They buried some of the victims of a suicide bombing that destroyed a crowded bus in Tel Aviv.

steven erlanger

— and in the ‘90s became much more of a terrorist group.

archived recording Hamas released a video of a young man it said had carried the bomb onto the crowded number five bus in downtown Tel Aviv.

steven erlanger

It set off a set of suicide bombings that really turned Israel upside down —

archived recording The organization has claimed credit for numerous suicide bombings in the last two years, including Wednesday’s bus blast in Jerusalem. It killed 17 Israelis.

steven erlanger

— and marked in Israeli brains that Hamas was among the most dangerous of the armed Palestinian groups and perhaps the most reckless.

archived recording Hamas now has specifically threatened our women and children. It is the first terrorist organization to do so. We will do whatever it takes for them not to be able to carry out their activities.

steven erlanger

At the same time —

archived recording The Israeli pullout from Gaza began today amid protests. Israeli soldiers went door to door, handing out eviction notices to the first of 8,500 Jewish settlers living there.

steven erlanger

When Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, decided it no longer wanted to rule over the millions of Palestinians in Gaza —

archived recording We will live in freedom. There will be no settlers, no army, no one to forbid us to move around as we wish.

steven erlanger

— the Palestinian Authority had an election.

archived recording It was Hamas supporters who were jamming the streets.

steven erlanger

— which Hamas won.

archived recording Hamas candidates won a huge victory, securing 76 seats to Fatah’s 43 in the Palestinian Legislative Council.

michael barbaro

I remember that election really well, Steve. It was a stunning development for much of the West, especially for Israel.

steven erlanger

It was stunning to Israel and stunning to Washington. And it gave Hamas more credibility. But in Gaza, there was an effort to keep control by the West Bank authorities of Fatah, which is the current heart of the Palestinian authority. And there was a war. There was a civil war inside Gaza, which Hamas won in a very brutal fashion in 2007. And it has controlled Gaza ever since. But Israel, though it had an embargo on Hamas, so did the whole West. Israel realized it needed to talk to someone in control of Gaza. Hamas was that address. So like it or not, hating Hamas or not, Israel had business to discuss. Even though it had withdrawn from Gaza, Israel was controlling imports and exports. It was controlling the sea coast. Many people felt, in any real legal terms, the occupation continued. So Israel developed a policy in a way of tolerating Hamas, believing that in the long run, the responsibilities of governing Gaza would moderate it.

michael barbaro

So to Israel, Hamas was not an ideal partner at all, but one that Israel could do business with and maintain a kind of status quo, in other words, a threat that could be managed.

steven erlanger

Yes, there were no illusions about Hamas. And there was violence. There have been lots of rocket fire back and forth. There have been terrorist attacks. Sometimes Hamas was responding to what it considered Israeli aggressions in the West Bank and elsewhere. Hamas has always been interested in trying to get Palestinian prisoners released from Israel, which is why it has taken hostages in the past to try to trade them. I mean, in a famous case, they kept an Israeli soldier for more than five years while negotiating a massive prisoner release. And every once in a while, when things get too hot, Israel does a serious bombing campaign. And the Israelis would come in with troops to, as they put it, ugly, cut the grass. And by that, they mean killing off parts of Hamas’ leadership and its troops to keep calm for a little while longer.

michael barbaro

And day to day, despite any misgivings Israel has about Hamas, there is never anything resembling an attempt to dislodge it as the government, the representatives of Palestinians in Gaza.

steven erlanger

Yes, that’s true because, basically, it would have meant reoccupying Gaza, going in with heavy ground forces, which Benjamin Netanyahu was always reluctant to do. It’s not like he wasn’t being pressured sometimes to deal with Hamas. But he understood how hard a war that was going to be, the number of civilian casualties it would inevitably create inside Gaza. And he always pulled back from it. But now, that calculation has changed because of the horrors of what happened last weekend. The whole idea of somehow tolerating Hamas to manage Gaza has been exploded. And Israel intends now to do what it was always reluctant to do since it withdrew from Gaza in 2005, which is to send in ground forces in a serious way to wipe out Hamas.

michael barbaro

I just want to pause on this because what Israel is saying it wants to do to Hamas, destroy this group that governs millions of people in Gaza, is a very big and historic pledge to make. And I want to understand why what happened over the weekend has brought Israel to that place it never was willing to go before.

steven erlanger

That’s really the right question because as people are still uncovering bodies, there are more than 1,000 Israeli dead. And most of them aren’t soldiers. Most of them are civilians. They’re mothers and children, babies some of them, killed in their homes. And their homes are in Israel proper. They’re not in Gaza. And some Israelis say this is the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. And if that is true, what is the point of the state of Israel?

michael barbaro

So after this attack, Israel concludes that the very idea of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people requires action. It can no longer try to tolerate or manage this threat to its citizens. It must, it concludes, remove it.

steven erlanger

That is precisely right. Now, the implications of that are severe. But the country, which has been very divided politically over many issues, is united in feeling that this requires a massive military response.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Steve, now that Israel has shifted its thinking and decided that it will not be managing Hamas as a threat but is committed now to destroying Hamas, what do you understand that to mean exactly? And how, logistically, can that even be accomplished if Israel wants to do it?

steven erlanger

I think it can only be accomplished by a serious, coordinated, planned military attack involving artillery, air power, and infantry. And it’s taking a few days to think through to prepare. But Israel has called up 300,000 reservists.

michael barbaro

A huge, huge number of soldiers.

steven erlanger

It’s a huge number in a small country. It is gearing up for a sizable military operation. And it’s going to be brutal.

michael barbaro

Right. I’m wondering, Steve, if you can describe what a major operation like this will look like on the ground, given the very nature of Gaza.

steven erlanger

So Gaza is a very, very tightly packed city. People talk about refugee camps. But these camps are buildings. They’re structures. I mean, it’s not like people living in tents. It’s poor. But it’s also got facilities. Israelis already cut off electricity as best it can. It’s cut off water. It’s sealed the border. It will have to go in street by street with urban fighting. But I think that will be preceded by quite severe air attacks and artillery attacks. Already, you have the sense that Israel’s bombing of Gaza now is clearing pathways for the infantry. And of course, Hamas has planned for this retaliation. So Israel will have to deal with, I think, well-planned defenses, which will include IEDs, include booby traps. Many Hamas fighters wear civilian clothing. They can pop out of tunnels with an RPG. And this is going to make it very, very difficult for Israel to distinguish between normal civilian and fighter. And that’s really the point.

michael barbaro

Right.

steven erlanger

I mean, it’s almost inevitable that Israeli strikes on Hamas targets will hit or wound civilians. And it’s partly because Hamas deliberately lives among them and hides its munitions among them and in mosques and in hospitals. I’ve seen these things for myself. And I don’t expect them to be any different this time. Israel is already encouraging Gazan citizens to vacate the territory and actually go to Egypt. Israel, in the past, has also had this practice of warning buildings that it’s about to bomb by sending a piece of lead down onto the roof. Now, Israel is saying it no longer has the time to do that. It doesn’t have the aircraft to do that. It’s warning civilians that buildings may be bombed without warning. And already, from airstrikes, there hundreds of Palestinians dead and thousands displaced. Those numbers are only bound to go up considerably. Hamas, in contrast, has said when Israel does that, it will publicly execute some of the 150 or so Israeli hostages that it has. The other dilemma for Israel is if they’re going to go into Gaza in a big way, in some ways, it means they’re willing to sacrifice these hostages. They’ll try to save them if they can. They’re trying to find out where they are. But they’ve been split up. They’ve been moved around. They’ve been put into basements. It’s going to be very hard to fight Hamas and worry about the hostages all at the same time.

michael barbaro

Does that lead you to believe that Israel will or will not show some level of restraint, given that Israeli hostages will be in this theoretical war zone?

steven erlanger

It’s very good question. And I’m not sure the answer. Israel has always taken Israeli lives incredibly seriously. I mean, it was willing to trade thousands of prisoners for one Israeli soldier. And to have 150 civilians inside Gaza creates an enormous moral dilemma and an enormous strategic dilemma. But I think force protection has to be the main and crucial thing. And they’re going to save the people they can save. But I don’t think, given this war, they can worry overly much about any individual hostage.

michael barbaro

I want to understand back to the goal of this offensive, destroying Hamas, what the chances are that Israel really can actually wipe out Hamas? That’s its stated goal. What does that really even look like? Does that mean capturing or killing the most senior leaders of the organization? It has been the elected government. So does it mean removing all of Hamas’ officials from every level of government? How should we understand that?

steven erlanger

Well, they took power over Gaza. They installed themselves, right? I mean, it’s not like this is some wonderfully democratically elected government that is suddenly about to fall. Once they took over, they ran a pretty tough government. They set out after their enemies. They mistreated them. They run the place pretty strongly. So it’s very hard to get a really good sense of public opinion. The last major Palestinian poll there was in 2021. And 20 percent, 30 percent of people favored Hamas then. I’m sure now it’s much less. And also, Gazans now are really terrified of what’s going to happen after this great Hamas victory, so-called. They’re waiting for Israel’s retaliation. And they are terrified. But Israel I don’t think can destroy Hamas, in my own personal opinion. I believe Hamas’ leaders, and particularly its military leaders, are probably no longer in Gaza.

michael barbaro

Really?

steven erlanger

Yeah, because they can control the battle from outside. Their lives are obviously very valuable. And Israel has tried to kill them in the past. So they may be in very sophisticated bunkers way underground. It’s possible. They may be in tunnels way underground. That’s quite possible. They may have slipped into Egypt. That’s possible, too. So it’s going to be very hard to destroy the Hamas leadership. But Israel will try to dismantle the power structure, the military structure, of Hamas. But the big question everyone has is, well, what happens the next day? Do the Israelis stay? How long do they stay? And also, one shouldn’t rule out that there will be uprisings among other Palestinians, both inside Israel, inside the West Bank. Israel could find that its efforts in Gaza produce much more anger and resistance than it necessarily expects.

michael barbaro

Right. That is a question I think has to be on everyone’s mind. If Israel succeeds in any way in dismantling Hamas, what will replace it? And will Israel attempt to influence what replaces it? And thus, won’t whatever government that becomes be very suspicious to Palestinians living in Gaza? Won’t it be seen as a puppet government of Israel and not legitimate? And doesn’t that, therefore, make this entire mission potentially a slow-motion backfiring on Israel?

steven erlanger

If, in fact, the Israelis get that far, right? I mean, part of their problem is they can kill a lot of Hamas soldiers. They can destroy a lot of equipment and arms. They can go house to house. But they can’t prevent the idea of Palestinian resistance. They can’t extinguish that. And I’m sure some group will come to replace Hamas. So no, I don’t think you can kill the Palestinian idea. The problem is Gaza, as someone said to me, for Israel, it’s like a one-word argument for the dangers of giving up control and trusting Palestinians to run their own affairs. And Gaza for Palestinians and Palestinian supporters is a one-word argument for Israeli brutality and patronization and colonization of another people. And that’s a bridge that’s very hard to get over.

michael barbaro

I see what you’re getting at is what many see as the utter intractability of this situation long term. And that makes me want to understand, based on your reporting, what this moment is supposed to solve for either side. I think it’s fair to say that Hamas knew its attack inside Israel would elicit a very strong response. And it’s now facing what could be its own demise. And Israel may end up with an even more aggressive group governing Gaza once Hamas is out of power, if that happens. So what’s really going to have been accomplished here?

steven erlanger

Well, for Hamas, in a way, it was a way to remind the world the Palestinian problem still exists. Israel, as you know, has been negotiating with American help to have normalization with Saudi Arabia, to have a defense treaty between Saudi Arabia and the United States. And the Palestinians were always considered in the way of this. I mean, everyone made kind of lip service to, oh, we have to do something for the Palestinians. But they were very much put on the side. And I think part of what Hamas was doing was reminding the world that the idea of this kind of peace in the Middle East is a bloody mirage. And the Palestinian question cannot be ignored. For Israel, what matters now is to show the Middle East that it is a ruthless, powerful military force that will never be attacked this way again. The whole point of these regional deals that Israel’s been making with the Gulf, with the Saudis, comes from the Arab world’s understanding that Israel is a fact of life in the Middle East. It’s ineradicable, which was never really the judgment from ‘67 or ‘73. And now, the weakness Israel’s displayed in its loss to Hamas undercuts that fact of ineradicability. And Israelis feel they have to restore it, despite the cost to their own citizens. Each side is trying to show the world that the facts it represents will not go away. Hamas is proving to the world the Palestinian question exists. It cannot be shoved under the carpet or ignored forever. And Israel needs to show that it will stay a powerful state in the Middle East, that it is a fact of life, and that it will never be eliminated.

michael barbaro

And of course, in the middle of those two very powerful statements that both sides are making have been, and I presume will be, many dead civilians.

steven erlanger

There will be many dead civilians.

michael barbaro

Well, Steve, thank you very much. We appreciate it.

steven erlanger

Thank you, Michael.

michael barbaro

On Tuesday night, Israel said it had re-established control of the towns attacked by Hamas, as the full scope of the assault came into greater relief. The death toll within Israel surpassed 1,000 people. And Israeli officials said they had recovered the bodies of 1,500 Palestinian assailants, highlighting just how many fighters were involved in the attack. As Israel’s counteroffensive intensified, the number of dead in Gaza reached at least 900 people. Finally, in Washington —

President Biden denounced Hamas as bloodthirsty terrorists and called the group’s attack, quote, “an act of sheer evil.”

Attempts by politicians to link Mideast terror groups and Mexican criminal organizations have at times gained traction over the past two decades, but no substantial evidence has surfaced to support the claim, counterterrorism and insurgency experts said. The two kinds of groups have vastly different objectives and operate in cultural and economic borderland regions that do not share remotely similar dynamics.

With apprehensions at the southern border up overall, U.S. officials this year have recorded an increase in apprehensions of people whose identities match those on the F.B.I. terrorist watch list — 160 migrants in the 2023 fiscal year as of July, up from 100 the fiscal year before, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Such rolls constitute a small fraction of the millions of people seeking to cross the southern border and do not significantly measure the terror threat against the United States, terrorism and insurgency experts said. The uptick may be owing in part to the broad nature of the lists, they added, ensnaring people wanted for terrorist activities against their home countries but not aimed at the United States, as well as relatives or associates not accused of wrongdoing.

Although experts do not completely rule out the threat of a terror attack launched from the southern border, they described it as unlikely.

If Mideast terror organizations ever did plan an attack, “the northern border may even be more vulnerable,” said Bruce Hoffman, professor and director of the Center for Jewish Civilization at Georgetown University who specializes in terrorism studies. And such a plot would not necessarily be connected to illegal immigration, he added.

The 9/11 hijackers entered the United States on tourist, business and student visas. The last man to physically cross the border with materials for an explosive — Ahmed Ressam — was arrested in 1999 after he came in from Canada."
207,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/world/middleeast/biden-israel-visit-gaza-hospital-strike.html,"As President Biden slowly made his way around a hotel conference room, each of the survivors or relatives of victims of the devastating Hamas attacks in Israel told him their story of tragedy or defiance. One by one, he gave each of them a hug and talked about his own experiences with loss.

In a way, Mr. Biden flew to Israel on Wednesday to give the whole country a hug, to say how much America grieves with Israel and stands by Israel and has Israel’s back. But with the hug came a whisper in the ear as well, a gentle warning not to give in to the “primal feeling,” not to let overwhelming grief or overpowering anger drive the country to go too far, as he believes America did after Sept. 11, 2001.

“Shock, pain, rage — an all-consuming rage,” Mr. Biden said later in a speech to the Israeli nation. “I understand and many Americans understand. You can’t look at what has happened here to your mothers, your fathers, your grandparents, sons, daughters, children, even babies and not scream out for justice. Justice must be done. But I caution this — while you feel that rage, don’t be consumed by it. After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.”

Mr. Biden did not elaborate, but he presumably was referring to the invasion of Iraq, which he voted for as a senator and later came to regret. Nor did he explain what he meant in Israel’s case, but the meaning was clear enough. As Israel seeks to destroy Hamas, which killed more than 1,400 people and took nearly 200 hostages, his message was that it should not give in to excesses that cause unnecessary loss of innocent life — and in the process, squander the world’s sympathy the way the United States eventually did two decades ago."
208,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/us/politics/progressive-jews-united-states.html,"Progressive Jews who have spent years supporting racial equity, gay and transgender rights, abortion rights and other causes on the American left — including opposing Israeli policies in Gaza and the West Bank — are suddenly feeling abandoned by those who they long thought of as allies. This wartime shift represents a fundamental break within a liberal coalition that has long powered the Democratic Party.

In Los Angeles, Rabbi Sharon Brous, a well-known progressive activist who regularly criticizes the Israeli government, described from the pulpit her horror and feelings of “existential loneliness,” her voice breaking. “The clear message from many in the world, especially from our world — those who claim to care the most about justice and human dignity — is that these Israeli victims somehow deserved this terrible fate.”

In Atlanta, a Jewish mother involved in local politics wrote an open letter lamenting that her child’s progressive private school had not addressed the attacks in Israel with the same kind of empathy it showed after local killings of Asian Americans. “Our people are butchered, and no one speaks to it?” she wrote. “I don’t know if I’m seething or just sad.”

And as the Hamas attacks in Israel were still underway, leaders of the New Israel Fund, which supports progressive Israeli and Palestinian groups, fielded calls from a former American ally on the left demanding that the organization label Israel an “apartheid state” — even as they waited to learn if colleagues in another organization, hiding in Israeli bomb shelters, had been killed.

Many of the most inflammatory comments came on social media, from progressive groups that responded to the immediate aftermath of the massacre of Israeli civilians by skipping even a moment of mourning and instead moving immediately to try to justify the attack.

“When a people have been subject to decades of apartheid and unimaginable violence, their resistance must not be condemned, but understood as a desperate act of self-defense,” Black Lives Matter Los Angeles posted on Facebook, in its first response to the attack. A reproductive-rights group sharply criticized the “Zionist occupation,” saying that the Israeli government denied “Palestinians control over their bodies” and that “there can be no justice, peace or reproductive freedom underneath colonial occupation.” A number of socialist organizations across the country did not directly condemn the killings by Hamas.

And many protests have included chants of “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” a slogan that leaves no place for the state of Israel to exist in its own land.

From email listservs of progressive Jewish groups to protests on university campuses to social-media campaigns by prominent liberal Jewish celebrities like Sarah Silverman, the war is bringing to a head more than a decade of tensions about Israel on the American left.

Interviews with dozens of liberal Jewish leaders and voters, and a review of social media posts, private emails and text chains of liberal Jewish groups, reveal a politically engaged swath of American Jewry who are reaching a breaking point. They have long sought an end to the Israeli government’s occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, supported a two-state solution and protested the right-wing government of Benjamin Netanyahu.

But in the Hamas attacks, many saw an existential threat, evoking memories of the Holocaust and generations of antisemitism, and provoking anxiety about whether they could face attacks in the United States. And they were taken aback to discover that many of their ideological allies not only failed to perceive the same threats but also saw them as oppressors deserving of blame.

“I am in such a state of despair — in my generation, we have been warned how quickly people would turn on us and we just thought no way,” said Nick Melvoin, 38, a member of the Los Angeles Unified School Board who is now running for Congress and keeps a framed picture of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel marching with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his office. “Now we see, this is how that happens: When you dehumanize the group. This indoctrination that many of us have been warned about hit us like a ton of bricks.”

The most rattling episodes have occurred on college campuses or on social media, where statements from small organizations have been amplified across the globe. But during a worldwide conflict, those statements have taken on totemic status, heightening fears that they are a precursor to a more treacherous and lasting shift in the standing of Jews in America.

Eric Spiegelman, a lawyer and podcast producer in Los Angeles who serves on municipal boards, was enraged by the protest in New York City promoted by the Democratic Socialists of America after the attack. He sent hundreds of letters to Los Angeles city officials urging them to denounce the organization and label it a “hate group.” The D.S.A. has since backed away from the protest and apologized “for not making our values explicit.”

“It’s like, I belong to this political organization that believes in three things: affordable housing, raising the minimum wage, and the wholesale murder of Jews,” said Mr. Spiegelman, his voice dripping with sarcasm as he condemned local leaders who are affiliated with the group. “Two out of three ain’t bad!”

With President Biden making a personal show of support through an unprecedented wartime visit to Israel this week — and promising the country billions in aid — traditional Democratic support for Israel is not in doubt. The crisis has largely unified the Democratic Party establishment, including many progressive elected officials. Polling since the attacks indicates strong national backing for Israel, including a notable uptick in support among Democrats.

Still, cracks have begun to emerge among the Democratic coalition. Younger and more liberal voters remain more focused on the Palestinian cause than older generations, a split that emerged in the last two decades and accelerated during the Trump administration. Among them are many American Jews who are far more critical of Israel than their forebears and have flocked to groups like IfNotNow and Jewish Voice for Peace, which staged a protest in the U.S. Capitol calling for a cease-fire and has repeatedly accused Israel of planning genocide in Gaza.

“We need to remember that anyone dehumanizing Israelis rightly has zero representation in the United States government, while many federal officials have been dehumanizing Palestinians for decades,” Eva Borgwardt, the political director of IfNotNow, said in an interview."
209,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/movies/academy-museum-gala-israel.html,"It’s hard not to see the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures’s attempt to put on this year’s gala — a glamorous party that raises more than $10 million for the museum and burnishes its image by drawing Hollywood A-listers — as anything but ill-fated.

First the Hollywood strikes complicated efforts to hold the party, since striking actors are barred from promoting films and few would want to rub elbows socially with executives from the big studios that they are on strike against. That difficulty was ironed out after studio executives, who are among the museum’s biggest financial supporters, agreed not to come and union officials said actors could attend as long as they did not promote films.

Then the Israel-Hamas war cast a shadow over the festivities, which had been scheduled for Saturday night. First the museum announced that the red carpet — where stars parade in their finery for photographers before going in — would be canceled. Then, on Thursday, the museum announced that the gala would be postponed.

“Out of respect for the devastating conflict and loss of life happening overseas, we have made the decision to postpone the Academy Museum gala this Saturday,” the museum said in a statement on Thursday evening. “We look forward to rescheduling at a later date. We thank everybody deeply for their support.”"
210,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/12/us/politics/democrats-israel-hamas-war-palestine.html,"“What is critical for us is to not lapse into moral equivocation,” said Representative Jake Auchincloss, a Democrat and Jewish military veteran who represents suburban Boston. “We have hard weeks ahead, and Congress is going to have to steel ourselves.”

Republicans have tried to capitalize on the cracks in the party. At the Capitol on Tuesday, a Fox News reporter followed Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat from Michigan, pushing the first Palestinian-American woman in Congress to comment on Hamas atrocities. Ms. Tlaib refused to acknowledge the question, as she walked briskly through the halls. A day after the attack, Ms. Tlaib had described Israel as an “apartheid government” and called to stop “unconditional” American aid to the country.

Asked about the moment in an interview on Fox News the next morning, Nikki Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, said: “I don’t know how they justify 1,200 dead. I don’t know how they justify the torture. That’s between them and God.”

Ms. Tlaib later sent a statement clarifying her position. “I do not support the targeting and killing of civilians, whether in Israel or Palestine,” she said. “The fact that some have suggested otherwise is offensive and rooted in bigoted assumptions about my faith and ethnicity.”

Former President Donald J. Trump has spent years highlighting the comments of Ms. Tlaib and others to try to break the traditionally overwhelming support of Jews for Democratic candidates. In 2019, Mr. Trump even went so far as to call Jews who voted for Democrats “disloyal to Israel” — a comment that was criticized for echoing an anti-Semitic trope about dual loyalties. A 2021 survey by the American Jewish Committee, a nonpartisan group that conducts public opinion research about the Jewish community, found that 68 percent of Jewish voters reported casting their ballots for Mr. Biden in the 2020 election."
211,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/us/politics/biden-israel-gaza-war-democrats.html,"As President Biden visited Tel Aviv on Wednesday to demonstrate American solidarity with Israel amid escalating violence after the deadliest attack it has faced in 50 years, Democratic rifts over the conflict were beginning to tear open, leaving him presiding over a party struggling to resolve where it stands.

The president’s trip, and his broader handling of the war, have presented him with both political risks and a chance to pump energy into a re-election bid that Democratic voters have been slow to embrace.

Mr. Biden’s steadfast support for Israel after the Hamas attack, by far the dominant position in Washington, has won him plaudits from some Republicans as well as Democrats. An international crisis, even with its grave geopolitical dangers, is relatively comfortable political terrain for a president with deep foreign policy experience.

While international issues rarely drive American elections, Mr. Biden and his allies will see playing the role of statesman abroad — especially if he can help calm the soaring tensions — as a welcome change from a wide range of domestic challenges dragging down his approval ratings."

“Where is the army,” Amit Man, 22, texted her family after hiding from Hamas attackers for five hours, before she was shot and killed. Others hid in the woods, barricaded themselves in safe rooms and waited for as many as 26 hours for help to arrive.

The slow response of Israeli forces on Saturday, a national holiday, gave Hamas terrorists many hours to infiltrate more than 20 towns outside of Gaza, where they killed at least 1,200 people and took an estimated 150 hostages.

Israeli officials declined to answer questions about the timing of their response to the attacks. Here’s what we know about the timeline of some of the deadliest events and the official response, based on interviews with survivors and their family members, and an analysis of photos and video.

Before the attacks Before 6:30 a.m. Israeli response



But the warning Israeli intelligence detected an unusual surge in activity on Gazan militant networks it monitors and alerted the Israeli soldiers guarding the Gazan border.But the warning wasn’t acted upon , either because the soldiers didn’t receive it or the soldiers didn’t read it. Start of attacks Around 6:30 a.m. The deadliest attacks in Israel’s history started in many places at the same time. Armed paragliders took off from Gaza. Militants used drones to destroy Israeli surveillance stations and began to fire thousands of rockets. Commandos in trucks and on motorbikes sped into southern Israel.



The rockets lit up the dawn sky at an all-night festival, and concertgoers began to evacuate. Around 6:30 a.m. A group of students in Nir Oz went into shelters. They would not be rescued for nearly 12 hours.



Shirley Okev went to a safe room in Kfar Aza, a nearby village. She would not leave for more than 20 hours. She contacted her son to alert the army. “But the army didn’t come fast, we waited for a long time,” she said. 6:31 a.m. Israeli response The Israeli military’s response to the rockets was immediate, but it said nothing of a ground invasion. 6:35 a.m. Around the same time in Alumim, Sarit Kurtzman heard rocket sirens and rushed into her safe room with her 14-month-old baby. She would stay there for 26 hours until help arrived. Yonatan Kurtzman 30 minutes after attacks began Just after 7:00 a.m. Be’eri Sderot Sderot Be’eri 7:04 a.m. As Hamas gunmen swept through multiple towns, Arie Itzik, a retired nurse who was sheltering in Nir Oz, received a call for help from a woman who had gone out for a walk. Militants had shot her and her husband, she told him. She was wounded and thought her husband was dead. She would later be kidnapped, Mr. Itzik said.



Mr. Itzik would shelter for at least eight more hours before soldiers arrived to rescue him.



“The army wasn’t in the area, not even one soldier.” He added: “We were all by ourselves. It was terrifying.” An hour after attacks began Around 7:30 a.m. By now, many civilians had been killed in towns around the Gaza border, including in Sderot, where gun battles were ongoing. Around 7:30 a.m. Gunshots rang out as panicking festival attendees exiting the event were stuck in traffic. “That was the first moment we understood we were really under a colossal attack,” said Almog Senior, a student at Ben-Gurion University.



Many attendees fled their cars and ran across fields. Mr. Senior and his friends drove off-road in an attempt to reach safety. 7:40 a.m. Israeli response The Israeli military reported that Hamas militants had crossed the border and urged civilians to stay in their homes. But people at home were in grave danger. 7:52 a.m. “I have a lot of wounded and dead here,” Amit Man texted her family from the small Be’eri clinic where she cared for patients. “I have no way to help.” About 8 a.m. After running from attackers at the concert, festivalgoer Noa Kalash, 22, and her boyfriend, Maor Benezri, 25, found a bush to hide in. They would hide there for seven more hours before being rescued.



“It wasn’t quiet even for a second,” she said. “We kept hearing shootings, vehicles, motorcycles.” At least one of her friends is missing and another is dead. 2 hours after attacks began 8:23 a.m. Israeli response Israel declared a state of alert for war. “Over the past hour, the Hamas terrorist organization launched massive barrages of rockets from Gaza into Israel, and its terrorist operatives have infiltrated into Israel in a number of different locations in the south.” 8:26 a.m. “They are here,” Sahar Kalderon, 16, wrote to her sister, Gaya, in a text message. It was the last Gaya heard from half of her family, who lived in Nahal Oz. Sahar Kalderon, right, with her brother, Erez via Kalderon family 8:53 a.m. At least seven bloodied bodies of civilians were found in a room after an attack on the kibbutz of Kfar Aza, photos show. 3 hours after attacks began 9:23 a.m. Dash cam footage from a car parked north of the festival shows Hamas terrorists dragging away a civilian and executing another. Source: South First Responders 9:30 a.m. “They’re coming in,” Yarden Bibas, 36, wrote to his sister Ofri by WhatsApp.



Later, footage circulating on social media showed his wife, Shiri, and their two children — one of them just 9 months old — imprisoned by Palestinian militants.



There was no sign of Mr. Bibas. 9:32 a.m. Photographs taken around the same time show attackers bringing Israeli civilians — including a man, two elderly women and a young woman — to Gaza from Kfar Aza as hostages. Hatem Ali/Associated Press 10:06 a.m. Israeli response Over three and a half hours after the attacks began, Israel’s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said Israel was at war. 4 hours after attacks began About 10:35 a.m. Militants broke into the home of Irit Lahav in Nir Oz. “We were trying not to even breathe,” she said. “We were hugging on the floor, holding each other and telling each other how much we love each other.” 10:46 a.m. Israeli response Israel announced it was striking targets in Gaza. But many people on the ground were still on their own. 10:54 a.m. “I’m afraid to breathe.” “I love you.” Vivian Silver , a peace activist, sent her last texts to her son Yonatan Zeigen four hours after attackers first entered her village of Be’eri. She has not been seen since. 5 hours after attacks began 11:35 a.m. Israeli response Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel made his first statement to the nation on the crisis. He told Israelis that they were at war. 11:44 a.m. From the Be’eri clinic, Ms. Man messaged her family asking when the army would come. “I don’t understand,” she wrote. “It’s been hours already.” Via Haviva Izikson 12:09 p.m. Dash cam footage from a car left near the festival shows another group of militants walking by and rifling through personal items of an executed individual, indicating the area around festival was still unsecured nearly six hours after the attack began. Concert attendees were still hiding in undergrowth and the surrounding countryside. Source: South First Responders 6 hours after attacks began 12:21 p.m. Israeli response The Israeli military announced it had sent troops and reserve forces to southern Israel to reclaim towns taken by Hamas attackers. 7 hours after attacks began 1:50 p.m. Israeli response Photographs show the Israeli military in Sderot. Many Israeli soldiers were killed at bases near the border, and drone strikes caused communication problems. An Israeli commander who helped lead the counterattack in the south described retaking villages on an ad hoc basis. Tsafrir Abayov/Associated Press 2:02 p.m. “They’re here. I don’t think I’m going to make it out of here. Please be strong if something happens to me,” Amit Man, the paramedic at the Be’eri clinic, texted her family.



Minutes later, her sister reached her by phone. Ms. Man said she had been shot in the legs, attackers had murdered everyone else and she did not think she would survive. The line dropped. More than two days later, her family received news that her body had been found.



“We told her that any time the military will get inside and get them out,” her sister said later. “We really believed in that. I promised her.”



“We never never imagined, in our worst dream, that she would not make it, that the soldiers would not be there in time to rescue them and to save them,” she said. Via Haviva Izikson 8 hours after attacks began 2:30 p.m. In Nir Oz, Irit Lahav heard people break into her home again, four hours after the first break-in. “We kept hoping for help,” she said. 11 hours after attacks began 5:24 p.m “Does anyone know where the army is?” a Nir Oz resident wrote in a neighborhood WhatsApp group seen by The New York Times. About 6 p.m. Israeli response The army rescued students in Nir Oz.



Elsewhere in the kibbutz, Ms. Lahav and her daughter were also rescued. They emerged to see that the town’s dozens of bicycles had been stolen, cars had been burned and houses had been looted. The attackers, she noted, “had plenty of time.” 12 hours after attacks began About 7 p.m. Israeli response The rescued Nir Oz residents gathered in a kindergarten. “We realized that it was only about half of the people from the kibbutz,” said Lotus Lahav, Ms. Lahav’s daughter. 7:11 p.m Israeli response The Israeli military reported that it had struck down attackers in southern towns in the last few hours, including four fighters in Nir Oz and Erez Crossing. It said it had “neutralized” hundreds overall. 16 hours after attacks began About 11 p.m. Israeli response Soldiers rescued Mika Atiia and Dvir Efrat in Be’eri. Via Dvir Efrat 20 hours after attacks began About 3 a.m., Oct. 8 Israeli response In Kfar Aza, Ms. Okev was rescued from a safe room.

Israeli officials are just beginning to reckon with the wide array of logistical and intelligence lapses that paved the way for the Gazan incursion into southern Israel and the delayed Israeli response. The full scale of the atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists on Saturday is still being uncovered and understood.

By Monday morning, Israeli soldiers were still fighting militants in at least six towns, and periodic clashes continued even after an Israeli military spokesman said the military had regained control of all communities.

An estimated 260 people may have died around the site of the festival, and 108 bodies were recovered from Be’eri. In Kfar Aza, scores, or perhaps hundreds, of people were killed, soldiers and rescue workers said.

But days after the attacks, residents were still waiting on the military for one more thing: recovering bodies. In Nir Oz, Mr. Itzik, the retired nurse, said he could begin to identify bodies, but that it was the military that needed to notify families.

“I can’t tell their family that they are dead. It’s not my job to do it. I’m not allowed to,” Mr. Itzik said.

Mr. Itzik said family members told him, “We can’t wait for I don’t know how many weeks or days or months to hear from the army.”"

Trump, who frequently paints himself as the fiercest defender of Israel to ever occupy the White House, on Wednesday criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a speech in Florida just days after deadly Hamas attacks rocked the country.

Gen. Qassim Suleimani, by an American drone strike in 2020.

Mr. Trump said that Israel had been working with the United States on a plan for the attack, but that he had received a call shortly beforehand to let him know that Israel would not take part. The United States proceeded anyway.

“But I’ll never forget,” Mr. Trump said. “I’ll never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down. That was a very terrible thing.”"

216,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/opinion/israel-gaza-united-nations.html,"We urgently need a way out of this disastrous dead end before more lives are lost.

There are several key priorities to focus on right now in order to pull the world back from this abyss. The United Nations and our partners need rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access now throughout Gaza. Humanitarian aid including fuel, food and water must be allowed to enter.

All hostages in Gaza must be released. Civilians must not be used as human shields.

International humanitarian law — including the Geneva Conventions — must be respected and upheld. Civilians on both sides must be protected at all times. Hospitals, schools, clinics and United Nations premises must never be targeted. I mourn my colleagues in Gaza who have already lost their lives in the last week. And still, United Nations personnel are working nonstop to support the people of Gaza. We will continue to do so.

I have been in constant contact with leaders in the region. It is clear that the ongoing upheaval in the Middle East is polarizing communities around the world, widening divides, and spreading and amplifying hate. If truth is the first casualty of war, reason is not far behind.

I am horrified to hear the language of genocide entering the public discourse. People are losing sight of each other’s humanity. Brutality and violence cannot be allowed to obscure a fundamental truth: We are all the product of our lived realities and collective history.

The Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset put it this way: “Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia” — “I am myself and my circumstances.” And sometimes, those circumstances are unbearable."
217,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/books/frankfurt-book-fair-israel-war-adania-shibli.html,"The Frankfurt Book Fair, one of the largest literary events in the world, began this week under a cloud of anger and recrimination after the cancellation of an event honoring a Palestinian author — a decision that set off a heated debate about the role of literary and cultural organizations in times of strife.

Hundreds of authors and publishers signed a letter in protest over the treatment of the Palestinian novelist Adania Shibli. Several publishing organizations from the Middle East and Asia withdrew from the fair. And during the fair’s opening ceremony on Tuesday evening, the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek made a speech in which he condemned the decision as “scandalous,” and was interrupted repeatedly by a local politician, the antisemitism commissioner of the German state of Hesse.

“I’m not only proud to be here,” Žižek said. “I’m also a little bit ashamed.”

The controversy erupted before the fair even began. Shibli was supposed to receive a prize at Frankfurt given “to women writers from the Global South” for her novel “Minor Detail,” which begins in 1949 during the clashes between Israeli and Arab forces. The book includes an account of the gang rape and murder of a Bedouin girl by an Israeli Army unit.

Litprom, the organization that manages the prize, announced last week that it was canceling the ceremony in Shibli’s honor. (Litprom is funded by the Frankfurt Book Fair and the German government.) A panel with Shibli, who divides her time between Jerusalem and Berlin, and her German translator was also canceled.

“In light of the terror against Israel, Litprom is looking for a suitable format and setting for the event after the book fair,” Juergen Boos, the director of the book fair, said in a statement explaining the decision. In the same statement, Boos said that following the attacks in Israel, the fair would “give Israeli and Jewish voices additional time on our stages.”

“Minor Detail” has drawn praise from critics and prize committees, and was nominated for both the International Booker Prize and the National Book Award. Barbara Epler, the publisher of New Directions, which released an English translation of the book in 2020, said the canceled event was especially troubling because Shibli’s novel is a condemnation of the endless cycle of violence in the region.

“This isn’t someone who condones violence in any form,” she said of Shibli. “She’s a voice for peace and understanding.”

Others have criticized the book and its selection for the award. A German judge for the prize, Ulrich Noller, resigned from the jury this summer when the book was chosen. A literary critic at Taz, a left-leaning German newspaper, said the book portrays “the State of Israel as a murder machine.”

Reached by email, Shibli said that she was unable to comment because she felt “truly lost for words with what’s been unfolding in Palestine/Israel.” In a previous statement to The New York Times, Shibli said it was alarming to see “populism attempting to take its hold on literature.”

“Literature cannot be in the grip of one group, not when it forges an intimate link with every reader,” she wrote.

In the open letter, which was signed by hundreds of writers, including the Nobel laureates Olga Tokarczuk, Abdulrazak Gurnah and Annie Ernaux, members of the literary community denounced the cancellation of Shibli’s events. “The Frankfurt Book Fair has a responsibility, as a major international book fair, to be creating spaces for Palestinian writers to share their thoughts, feelings, reflections on literature through these terrible, cruel times, not shutting them down,” the letter states.

Among the organizations that withdrew from the fair was the Indonesian Publishers Association, which said that “siding with Israel while forgetting the suffering of the Palestinian people is like reading only one book to feel like you understand the whole world.”

In an email on Thursday, the organizers of the fair emphasized that the award to Shibli was never in question, only that they had planned to postpone its presentation until after the fair.

“To dispel false reports and misunderstandings that may have arisen in the past hours: Millions of innocent people in Israel and in Palestine are affected by this war, and our sympathy goes out to all of them,” the organizers said in an email on Thursday. “We truly hope that ways can be found to bring them out of this violence.”

Of the 200,000 attendees expected at the fair, and exhibitors from nearly 100 countries, the organizers said, they had received very few withdrawals.

Daniel Simon, the publisher of Seven Stories Press and a signatory on the open letter, said that emotions were high at the opening ceremony, but the conversation seemed to have been “necessary and constructive.”

“This kind of learning from each other, taking in what other people are saying,” Simon said, “this is what we’re here for.”

The debate over the role of writers in times of conflict is likely to remain a topic throughout the fair, which runs through Sunday. This coming weekend, Salman Rushdie, the acclaimed novelist and free speech advocate who was attacked at a public event last year, will receive the fair’s peace prize and give a public talk.

When asked about the current war between Israel and Hamas, and whether literature could help foster understanding, Rushdie said that while writers cannot stop a war, they can help by documenting human suffering.

“What writers can do, and what they are doing, is to try and articulate the incredible pain that many people are feeling right now,” Rushdie told a German news media outlet covering the fair. “And to bring that to the world’s attention.”

But the war between Israel and Hamas has heightened emotions, threatening to tear apart already fragile campus cultures.

Complicating it all: outside groups, influential alumni and big-money donors, who are putting maximum pressure on students and administrators.

At the University of Pennsylvania, donors are pushing for the resignation of the president and the board chairman, after a Palestinian writers’ conference on campus invited speakers accused of antisemitism.

At Harvard, a billionaire couple quit an executive board. Another donor pulled money for fellowships. And Lawrence Summers, a former Harvard president and Treasury secretary, criticized the leadership for a “delayed” response to the Hamas attack and the student letter.

This is not the first time that Harvard students have taken up an unpopular view. But those involved with the letter had not anticipated that their statement would go viral and unleash such repercussions."

The point of her whirlwind excursion to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Ms. Hochul said, would be purely and powerfully symbolic, a bold gesture of support by the leader of a state that is home to the largest population of Jews outside of Israel.

“There is a deep, direct connection between New York State and Israel that has always been there, a bond steeled over decades,” the governor, a Democrat, said in an interview at Kennedy Airport shortly before boarding a 10-hour commercial flight. “And it’s easy to go when the sun is shining and everything is fine.”

“The community feels, in Israel and in New York, that my going during these times will be the most significant symbol of their importance to us than anything else we could do,” she said."
220,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/opinion/israel-hamas-attack.html,"Israel responded to this aggression with strikes in Gaza, killing at least 687 Palestinians so far, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Israelis that this will be “a long war.”

President Biden is right to express America’s full support for Israel at this painful moment. The United States, as its closest ally, has a critical role to play. Moderate Israeli opposition leaders said they were prepared to join Mr. Netanyahu in an emergency government. The Biden administration, and all of Israel’s friends and allies, should encourage such a broad coalition. A unity government is the best chance Israel has to come together to defend itself against aggression, as it has at so many times in its history, and emerge from this war able to keep working toward a stable, secure future that includes peace with the Palestinians.

It is also the administration’s duty to work to prevent this terrible eruption of violence from spreading from Gaza to involve Palestinians in the West Bank. Mr. Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and others have an invaluable role to play in maintaining open communication with leaders of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and of neighboring Arab states to urge calm.

For Republicans in Congress, this is an occasion to rise above political dysfunction and stand with the Biden administration to show resolve, in support of Israel and for peace and stability in the region. Israel and Hezbollah, an armed group based in Lebanon, exchanged fire on Sunday across Israel’s northern border. Hezbollah, like Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007, is sponsored by Iran. Representatives of Hamas and Hezbollah have claimed that Iran helped prepare the attack, and while those reports are so far unconfirmed, the danger of a wider war is real and significant.

The U.S.-brokered efforts to establish relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a potential breakthrough in bolstering the security of the Middle East, are suddenly in jeopardy. Iran opposes that step toward peace, and if it was, in fact, behind the Hamas attacks, derailing this rapprochement may have been a major goal. Israel and Saudi Arabia should continue this effort and deny terrorists a veto over the nations’ futures."

It was the commanding officer of his search-and-rescue brigade of the Israel Defense Forces, asking Mr. Lichtental to end his vacation in America, leave his family and report for duty, immediately.

Seventeen hours later, on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Lichtental was surrounded by hundreds of well-wishers at John F. Kennedy International Airport near the ticket counter for El Al Airlines, one of the few carriers still flying into Israel. Mr. Lichtental’s flight to Tel Aviv was scheduled to leave in 90 minutes. He tossed a bottle of vitamins into a cavernous duffel bag, then addressed some members of the crowd.

“I’m sorry, but I have to go now,” said Mr. Lichtental, 20. “I’m excited to go back.”

Within hours of the worst terror attacks in the history of the Jewish state, Kennedy’s Terminal 4 became a central hub in the international effort to defend Israel. Israeli soldiers and reservists like Mr. Lichtental were among the first to arrive, followed by people hoping to volunteer with medical and nonprofit groups.

The Israeli military called up more than 300,000 reservists for duty, many of whom had been traveling or living abroad. El Al Airlines added extra flights to handle the demand, Reuters reported. The airline will continue flying Saturday, suspending a policy in place since 1982 that banned flights on the Jewish Sabbath, according to Reuters. El Al did not respond to requests for comment."

In the Gaza Strip, while the Israeli military pummels the blockaded territory with airstrikes and demands that more than a million of its residents move south, Palestinians are hunkering down in fear. On Israel’s northern border, the army is clashing with a militant group in Lebanon. In Iraq and Yemen, armed groups have issued threats against Israel and the United States, its main ally. On Thursday, Israeli airstrikes hit the two main airports in neighboring Syria.

As Israel’s army prepares for a possible ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, the inferno flaring out from Gaza is turning into a potential nightmare for the entire region, threatening to destabilize not just Israel and the Palestinian territories, but also Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon.

American officials have doubled down on their support for Israel, with President Biden defending Israel’s “right to respond.”"
223,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/11/opinion/international-world/gaza-israel-palestinians-invasion.html,"It appears Hamas wants to draw Israeli soldiers into a quagmire, as Hezbollah did in Southern Lebanon from 1985 to 2000. After years of fighting, Israel suffered a humiliating and chaotic withdrawal, leaving an empowered and threatening Hezbollah on its northern border.

Why might Hamas want to draw the Israel Defense Forces into a bloody ground battle? Hamas is the uncontested power in Gaza, though elections have not been held since 2006. The Palestinian Authority; its main political party, Fatah; the business community; civil society; and family clan leaders cannot effectively challenge Hamas, which has become only stronger after each successive conflict with Israel. Despite an Israeli blockade and round-the-clock surveillance, Hamas has apparently been able to build and buy more rockets, steadily improve their range and accuracy, provide offensive combat training for its fighters and develop an intelligence network sophisticated and far-reaching enough to launch a simultaneous assault on 22 Israeli locations. Hamas surely believes it can defeat the Israelis on its home turf in a war of attrition.

Hamas also stands to expand its political credibility in the West Bank if Israel invades Gaza, particularly if Israeli advances stall. Many Palestinians in the West Bank already regard the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, as corrupt, enfeebled and unable to realize the aspirations of its people. Israel’s July incursion into the West Bank city of Jenin further highlighted that the government of the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, can neither protect the people of Jenin nor provide a vision of a more hopeful future. If Israel invades Gaza, Hamas may have the public support to challenge the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and potentially assume leadership as the sole representative of the Palestinian people.

In the broader region, Hamas can also count on its ally Hezbollah. The day after the Hamas attack in southern Israel, Hezbollah, presumably in an attempt to test the readiness of Israeli forces, engaged in fighting with the Israeli military along the northern border near Shebaa Farms, land that is controlled by Israel but claimed by Lebanon. Hezbollah may seek to gain advantage if Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank.

Despite its grotesque atrocities against civilians, Hamas may have already reset the political realignment in the Middle East by disrupting prospective diplomatic talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia. But if Gaza were now to escalate into a protracted ground war, Hamas could also undermine the Abraham Accords, which established agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, and break the trend of increasing Arab-Israeli normalization. The Palestinian Authority was unable to block the Abraham Accords, but Hamas could still unwind them."

Trump.

“I will always condemn antisemitism, appeasement and weakness on the radical left, but I will also call out weakness or confusion among conservatives as well,” Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina said during a speech about Israel on Tuesday at the Hudson Institute in Washington.

In a departure from his usually noncombative campaign style, Mr. Scott criticized both Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida and the entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who along with Mr. Trump have outlined anti-interventionist foreign policy positions. Mr. Scott highlighted Mr. Ramaswamy’s comments on Israel earlier this year (he has shifted his stance on cutting U.S. military aid to Israel), and Mr. DeSantis’s characterization of the war in Ukraine as a “territorial dispute,” which Mr. DeSantis later walked back.

Former Vice President Mike Pence also attacked several candidates in remarks on Saturday in which he criticized Republicans who “embraced the language of isolationism and appeasement.” He named Mr. Trump, Mr. Ramaswamy and Mr. DeSantis as voices that have “run contrary to the tradition in our party that America is the leader of the free world.”"

On Thursday night, his family received word: Mr. Darawsheh had been shot dead during the attack, said Ashraf Ayoub, who oversaw him in the United Hatzalah emergency medical services organization.

Mr. Darawsheh joined a grim list: He was one of more than 100 killed in what appears to have been one of the worst massacres of the sweeping surprise attack launched by Hamas on Saturday. And his death underscores how the terror did not spare Israel’s Arab citizens.

About two million of Israel’s citizens are Arab. Many identify as Palestinian or share close family ties with those in the West Bank and Gaza."

Students waving banners and flags faced off across hedges dividing the Manhattan campus, one day after an Israeli student there was assaulted. Other campuses around the city also erupted with rallies on Thursday following the Hamas attack on Israel over the weekend and the Israeli military response in Gaza.

The protests around the city were largely peaceful, but the passionate views on display and the anxieties the gatherings produced were testament to the shock felt in New York over the attacks, which have killed thousands.

“I feel very dispirited,” said Caroline Smith, 23, a Columbia student who said more than 10 members of her family live in Israel. Watching the pro-Palestine demonstration made her feel “highly disturbed,” she said."
227,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/opinion/international-world/israel-hamas-war.html,"In 2006, Israel essentially responded to Hezbollah: “You think you can just do crazy stuff like kidnap our people and we will treat this as a little border dispute. We may look Western, but the modern Jewish state has survived as ‘a villa in the jungle’” — which is how the former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak described it — “because if push comes to shove, we are willing to play by the local rules. Have no illusions about that. You will not outcrazy us out of this neighborhood.”

So the Israeli Air Force relentlessly pounded the homes and offices of Hezbollah’s leadership in the southern suburbs of Beirut throughout the 34 days of the war, as well as key bridges into and out of the city and Beirut International Airport. Hezbollah’s leaders and their families and neighbors paid a very personal price.

The Israeli response was so ferocious that Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a now famous interview on Aug. 27, 2006, with Lebanon’s New TV station, shortly after the war ended: “We did not think, even 1 percent, that the capture [of two Israeli soldiers] would lead to a war at this time and of this magnitude. You ask me, if I had known on July 11 … that the operation would lead to such a war, would I do it? I say no, absolutely not.”

Indeed, since 2006, the Israel-Lebanon border has been relatively stable and quiet, with few casualties on both sides. And while Israel did take a hit in terms of its global image because of the carnage it inflicted in Beirut, it was not nearly as isolated in the world or the Middle East over the short term or long run as Hezbollah had hoped.

Hamas must have missed that lesson when it decided to disrupt the status quo around Gaza with an all-out attack on Israel last weekend. This is in spite of the fact that over the past few years, Israel and Hamas developed a form of coexistence around Gaza that allowed thousands of Gazans to enter Israel daily for work, filled Hamas coffers with cash aid from Qatar and gave Gazans the ability to do business with Israel, with Gazan goods being exported through Israeli seaports and airports."

The creation of an emergency government came as the devastation of the Hamas incursion that overran dozens of towns and a military base last weekend became clearer: civilians, including children, shot dead in homes, in cars, on streets and in hiding places, with bodies still being recovered and counted. The Israeli government said the toll in the attack had risen to 1,200 people killed, 169 of them Israeli soldiers, almost 3,000 others wounded and an estimated 150 people believed kidnapped and held hostage in Gaza.

Israel’s military forces are carrying out a more intense campaign of airstrikes than in past conflicts with Gaza against Hamas, the group that controls the region, and its allies, killing at least 1,127 people and injuring more than 5,300, according to Gazan health officials, who say most of the casualties are noncombatants, including children. After Israel escalated its 16-year blockade of Gaza to a “complete siege” this week, cutting off fuel, water and food, electricity to the region shut down on Wednesday, and hospitals, already overwhelmed, reported that they would soon be unable to function.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu formed an emergency government yesterday, adding two opposition lawmakers — both former army chiefs — to his cabinet. Analysts said the infusion of military expertise would give the government greater legitimacy to make tough wartime decisions, including whether to invade Gaza, or even south Lebanon.

There was heightening fear that the conflict could widen: Fire was exchanged along Israel’s northern border with both Lebanon and Syria in recent days, and Israeli forces said they had launched retaliatory strikes inside Lebanon yesterday, hitting targets belonging to Hezbollah, an armed Iran-backed Lebanese group allied with Hamas.

Israel also launched more missiles at the Gaza Strip, where fears of a humanitarian disaster were growing. New airstrikes hit rescue crews trying to reach people buried under the rubble of earlier attacks. The authorities in Gaza said that its sole power plant had run out of fuel, forcing hospitals to rely on backup generators with limited fuel supplies.

Gazans say that Israel has hit structures that are normally safe, such as schools, hospitals and mosques. Israel has given broad warnings for people to leave certain neighborhoods or towns but acknowledged that the warnings are not as extensive or specific as they have been in the past."

Mr. Biden’s speech condemning the “evil” perpetrated by Hamas that killed more than 1,200 Israelis, his swift offer of military assistance, and the presence of his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Israeli soil have all won remarkable plaudits. A vast billboard in Tel Aviv thanks the president for his response. A video circulating on Israeli social media channels placed Mr. Biden’s speech on the terrorist attacks against clips of Hamas atrocities and Holocaust imagery.

The moment amounted to a return to the kind of staunch bipartisan bond between Israel and the United States that had been questioned during the Trump administration, as Republicans allied themselves with the Israeli right and some liberal Democrats called for reducing or imposing conditions on foreign aid and military assistance to Israel.

Now, as Mr. Biden finds himself plunged into a wartime relationship with Mr. Netanyahu, his strong support has wiped away those tensions, Israeli analysts and officials said.

“His speech was remarkable, very emotional. It came at the right time, when the morale in Israel was very low and we’re still digesting the number of casualties,” said Danny Danon, Israel’s former ambassador to the United Nations and chairman of the international branch of Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud. “The people of Israel felt that it came from his heart, and we appreciate that.”"

Mr. Biden visited Israel in a whirlwind trip on Wednesday, and in his speech, he said flatly that the hospital explosion was “not done by the Israelis.”

Mr. Biden used the address to remind people of the brutality of the Hamas attacks and the tragedy of civilian deaths in Gaza. But he also used the moment to remind people of the divisions that remain in the United States.

“We must, without equivocation, denounce antisemitism,” he said. “We must also, without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia. And to all you hurting, those of you who are hurting, I want you to know I see you. You belong. And I want to say this to you: You’re all American.”

Prices for benchmark European gas contracts are up more than 20 percent since the end of last week. In the latest concern, Finland said on Tuesday that a pipeline linking the country to Estonia had been damaged, possibly by sabotage. It added to unease in markets the day after the Israeli government ordered Chevron to shut down Tamar, one of the two large gas production platforms that the U.S. energy giant operates off Israel’s coast. Israel indirectly exports the gas to Europe via Egypt.

Gas storage facilities in Europe are nearly filled to capacity, easing fears about immediate shortages, and prices remain far cheaper than they were a year ago after Russia shut down most pipeline shipments to Europe. But the incidents highlighted that the continent, which has largely disconnected from Russian gas supplies, remains heavily dependent on imported fuel and could see higher prices persist in the event of a colder-than-average winter or other unexpected disruptions.

On Tuesday, the Finnish government raised fears that sabotage may have been involved in a leak detected along the offshore gas pipeline. Gasgrid, the Finnish transmission operator, on Sunday shut down the line known as Balticconnector after detecting the leak."

Israel’s siege and bombardment of Gaza — which came in response to an operation by Palestinian attackers that killed more than 1,300 people in Israel — has ignited anger in the Middle East. Across the region, many people do not view Israel as the victim of an unprovoked terrorist attack — as many American officials have described it — but rather as a colonial-style occupier, buttressed by the United States, that continually violates the rights of the Palestinians.

Everyone I know knows somebody who was killed or affected by the excruciating events of the past week. In my case, it is a family friend from our synagogue, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a dual American Israeli citizen, who was at the outdoor music festival that was ambushed by Hamas. Hundreds of people were murdered at the festival; some were taken hostage. Hersh was most likely one of them.

During the attacks of last weekend, an estimated 150 Israelis were kidnapped and are still being held hostage in Gaza as Israel may be preparing to launch a ground invasion of the enclave. Men, women, young and old, children and adults. Many are injured. We don’t know if they are being treated medically. Every hour that passes endangers them further.

Historically in Israel, the effort to seek the release of captives is a central ethos. Israel has gone out of its way both militarily and diplomatically to obtain the release of its citizens in the past. In 2011, it released more than 1,000 prisoners in exchange for Gilad Shalit, a soldier who was kidnapped in 2006 by Hamas. In 2004, Israel released nearly 450 prisoners to secure the release of an Israeli citizen, Elhanan Tennenbaum, and the bodies of three soldiers who were presumed to have been killed in action, all held by Hezbollah. There are many other examples, because the idea of sacrificing everything to return the captured is far older than the state of Israel. It can be found in the texts of our Jewish tradition.

Our sages saw securing the freedom of Jewish prisoners as a great commandment. The Amidah, the central prayer that observant Jews recite three times a day, speaks of God’s compassion as one who “heals the sick and frees the captives.” Our sages teach that we should follow in God’s footsteps and according to his attributes."

The last time I witnessed that level of face-to-face barbarism was the massacre of Palestinian men, women and children by Christian militiamen in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beirut in 1982, where the first victim I encountered was an older man with a white beard and a bullet hole in his temple.

While I have no illusions about Hamas’s long-established commitment to the destruction of the Jewish state, I am nonetheless asking myself today: Where did this ISIS-like impulse for mass murder as the primary goal come from? Not the seizing of territory, but plain murder? There is something new here that is important to understand.

Since I can’t interview the Hamas leadership, I’m drawing on my experience in the region, and here’s how I see it."

The Israel-Gaza war is intensifying, with Israeli forces having killed about 1,500 Palestinian fighters in retaliation for the deadly weekend attacks by Hamas. The government is mobilizing 360,000 reservists for a larger military campaign.

Companies worldwide have joined global leaders in expressing support for Israel and are looking after their employees in the country. But the businesses feeling the war’s impact most acutely are Israeli start-ups whose employees are taking up arms. (Israel has so many start-ups it has earned the nickname “the start-up nation.”)

Some are seeing up to half their staff being mobilized, one venture capitalist estimated to The Wall Street Journal. Some C.E.O.s, including those living abroad, are volunteering for service: “I want to be part of the people who are protecting our country,” Itamar Friedman, the co-founder of an artificial intelligence company, told The Journal.

Start-ups in particular are likely to see their staff called up, given how young many of their workers are. That may disrupt the tech sector, which accounts for roughly one-fifth of the Israeli economy."
240,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/11/business/dealbook/israel-gaza-social-media-musk.html,"Mideast war tests Musk’s free-speech commitments

Since taking over X, the social network once known as Twitter, Elon Musk has pledged to impose as few restraints on speech as possible.

But the Israel-Gaza war has driven a flood of misinformation and violent images and videos on the platform, testing the company’s commitment to those principles in the face of criticism from advertisers and hate-speech watchdogs. The stakes are growing for Musk after the European Commission’s top digital regulator warned him to clean up the platform or face steep consequences.

The site “has become a war zone with no ethics,” Achiya Schatz, director of FakeReporter, an Israeli organization that monitors disinformation and hate speech, told The Times. X has faced complaints about misleading posts — including photos and videos taken out of context — and violent imagery, much of it seeded by Hamas. Experts say that combating such content has become much harder since X, under Musk’s ownership, has gutted safety and moderation teams.

This material is appearing on other platforms as well, including WhatsApp and TikTok — to the point that child protection groups are urging parents in Israel to remove social media apps from their kids’ phones. But online advocates called out X, as well as the messaging platform Telegram, for not doing as much as other social networks to remove such content."
241,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/briefing/israel-gaza-hamas.html,"Nearly 50 years to the day after the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Israel was again taken by surprise by a sudden attack.

Unlike the series of clashes with Palestinian forces in Gaza over the past three years, this appears to be a full-scale conflict mounted by Hamas and its allies, with rocket barrages and incursions into Israel proper, and with Israelis killed and captured.

At least 250 Israelis have been killed, officials said, and more than 1,400 injured. The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said at least 313 Palestinians were killed, and 1,990 injured, as Israeli forces launched retaliatory airstrikes and the two sides engaged in pitched battles.

The psychological impact on Israelis has been compared to the shock of Sept. 11 in America. So after the Israeli military repels the initial Palestinian attack, the question of what to do next will loom large. There are few good options for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has declared war and is being pressured into a major military response."
242,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-attack-gaza.html,"A breach in the border fence is visible in the video, about a thousand feet from the communications tower. The tower is two-and-a-half miles west of the Be’eri kibbutz, near the northern end of Gaza, where Hamas fighters massacred more than 100 Israelis and took others as hostages on Saturday.

The other three towers — which are spaced between one and three miles apart along Israel’s border with Gaza — are seen smoking in satellite imagery captured at 11:31 a.m. on Saturday, several hours after Hamas’s attack on Israel began. It is unclear whether drones or some other weapon caused the damage.

From satellite imagery, all four of the communications towers look similar. But they could be used for different purposes, said Michael Armstrong, an associate professor of operations research at Brock University in Canada and an expert in military strategy.

Some may be for border surveillance, while others could be involved in the transmitting and receiving of data, such as military communications, he said.

The tower in the Qassam footage may be used for collecting intelligence as well as for facilitating cellular service, according to a former U.S. defense official who reviewed the video and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Israel’s surveillance capabilities. The former official added that the height of the towers, and their proximity to the border, indicates that they are used to monitor Gazans.

Mr. Armstrong said Hamas most likely targeted these towers to “blind Israeli commanders and prevent communication among their units.” He added that the munitions used would not need to be complex — they would just need to create shrapnel that could damage infrastructure like antennas, cameras and cables.

The attacks also included multiple strikes on Israeli observation towers used for visual surveillance along the border. The impact of the attacks on the towers’ functionality is not yet known."

From New York Times Opinion, I’m Lydia Polgreen.

I’m Ross Douthat.

carlos lozada

I’m Carlos Lozada.

lydia polgreen

And this is “Matter of Opinion.” [MUSIC PLAYING] Well, it’s been a really, really long week of absolutely horrible news. The attacks and counterattacks between Hamas and Israel are continuing. Thousands of people have died. Many more are injured. We’re already living in a world where there is a major land war in Europe, in Ukraine, obviously. Lots of concerns about various geostrategic questions, China, wave of coups in Africa. There’s a lot going on in the world and this just is another thing that makes me feel that we’re living in this kind of wildly dangerous and unpredictable time. So we’re going to get into all of that and what it means for the global order in the second half of our conversation. But I think we should focus on what’s happening in Israel. Since the news is rapidly changing and will have changed again by the time this airs, I want to take a little bit of a long view. I’m curious what you think, Carlos, because I think this is your cast of mind. Is this Israel’s 9/11 or is it a replay of the Yom Kippur War, which was the invasion of Israel by Egypt and Syria that happened 50 years ago, almost to the day of this Hamas invasion? What do you think we’re reaching for when you’re looking for that kind of metaphor and analogy in history?

carlos lozada

This is — I should emphasize this is not a region or a conflict over which I claim any expertise, but I do try to take a long view in my writing. And so in cases like these, I try to imagine precisely that. How are people going to be thinking about this and framing this over the long term? And how useful are those frames? And one that I’ve been thinking about for the last couple of days, because it’s been everywhere, is precisely the one you mentioned, that this is Israel’s 9/11. And there’s something both sort of horrifying and yet weirdly comforting in the use of historical analogies. It’s horrible that you have to reach for something of that magnitude to find any parallel for what happened. But when you say this is 9/11, or when you say this is Pearl Harbor, which is what people said on 9/11, you’re also saying, “I understand this. I have a frame of reference for this. And I came through this. We came through this out on the other side.” So journalists, columnists, Israeli officials have all said this is Israel’s 9/11. An IDF spokesman even said it was 9/11 and Pearl Harbor rolled into one. Actually, the one person who has come out and said that it’s very much not 9/11 is our colleague Tom Friedman, who says that the Al-Qaeda attack on New York and Washington was sort of unimaginable, whereas Israel constantly worries about Hamas doing stuff like this. I think Tom has a point. But I don’t want to litigate whether this is Israel’s 9/11. Both events are horrific enough without having to rank order them. I think the 9/11 comparison, though, is instructive in a lot of ways. I’m struck by how this attack by Hamas was multi-pronged, very complex, but enabled by a lot of low-tech means. Yeah, there were commercial drones, but also bulldozers, paragliders, motorcycles. It reminded me of the box cutters on 9/11, you know?

lydia polgreen

Yeah.

carlos lozada

The wall that Hamas sort of overpowered, in part, had cameras, radar, underground sensors. Didn’t matter. But the 9/11 comparison, I think, is interesting in the sense that, remember how quickly the “we are all Americans” vibe dissipated following 9/11. Remember how one of the outcomes of 9/11 was, I think it’s fair to say, in part, American overreach. We said that they attacked us because they hate our values of freedom. But in the ways that the United States responded to 9/11 over the 20 years that followed didn’t always reflect our values. There are ways that this is Israel’s 9/11 and there are ways in which I really hope it isn’t.

lydia polgreen

Yeah. I, of course, was thinking of that too and the ways in which America fundamentally lost its way, post 9/11 and embraced forms of torture and spying on our own people and other really serious moral lapses. And I share with you that feeling. And I think one of the things that I’m feeling this week also is just a real sense of terror. There were these horrific, horrific atrocities that were committed against defenseless Israeli citizens. And now, of course, the Israeli military is pledging to go in and just kind of roll through Gaza in a way that — they’ve cut off the water, they’ve cut off the electricity. And I think a lot about the people there. There’s a big difference between the people of Gaza and Hamas. Hamas basically came into power in 2006 and has not actually held elections again since then. And they have an iron-fisted rule over these two million civilians, who are trapped in a very, very narrow piece of land with no way to escape.

michelle cottle

I think the general consensus is that most people agree that one of the things Hamas wants is for Israel to overreact in some way. They want the videos that are popping up on Twitter of carnage and bloodshed in Gaza as the Israelis retaliate. That is something that will then challenge this kind of rallying around Israel. Once the retaliation starts and you see Palestinian civilians being caught in the crossfire, that changes the dynamic. And I think that Hamas is just kind of assumed to have factored that in to what it was doing. It kind of wants that.

lydia polgreen

Well, if they were explicitly hoping that this was going to be Israel’s 9/11, then 9/11 and the response to 9/11 led to Al-Qaeda mutated into ISIS and we ended up with the Islamic State and even more brutal. So I think one can see the directions that could spiral in. But if that’s the hope, then Lord help us all.

ross douthat

I mean, fundamentally, Israel has to try to destroy the leadership of Hamas. This is the problem at this moment is that independent of all sort of grand, strategic considerations — and I obviously think that the lesson of 9/11 is that you can have a trauma that leads to overreach, overreaction, and disaster. And in that sense, it’s an odd thing to invoke. If you say, “This was our Pearl Harbor,” then you’re invoking a huge defeat that was succeeded by, ultimately, an American triumph. If you evoke 9/11, you’re saying, “This is just like this huge trauma that we, in hindsight, responded to with an unsuccessful overextension of American power.” But with all of that said, there is no world in which Israel cannot attempt the sustained defeat of Hamas, whatever that may mean.

michelle cottle

I mean, this is a super delicate tightrope. And I just don’t know that Netanyahu, the prime minister, instills confidence that he’s the guy to handle a lot of this.

ross douthat

Well, this is the — the other open question is whether, as happened in Israel after the Yom Kippur War or whether this effectively ends the Netanyahu era, if he’s held fundamentally responsible for this failure, politically. And this goes to our colleagues’ point about the difference with 9/11. As much as there were warnings that George W. Bush and his team may have ignored, there was no core reason to expect what happened on September 11th in the way that there was a core reason to expect, to some extent, attacks like this. And that, I think, puts Netanyahu in a much more difficult political position than Bush was in after September 11th.

lydia polgreen

Yeah, it’s hard to know how this is going to unfold, obviously. But I was struck when President Biden spoke this week and made a very, I think, stirring statement about standing by Israel. And he specifically referenced the former prime minister of Israel, Golda Meir, who led Israel through the Yom Kippur War. And I believe it was said to him directly that essentially the secret weapon of Israel is that people have nowhere to go, which is absolutely . True. And the same is true of the people of Gaza. So I think that there is this radicalizing effect of whatever comes next. And it just feels huge and unpredictable. [MUSIC PLAYING] And it feels huge and unpredictable how all of this is going to play out for the rest of the world and also specifically for the United States. So when we come back, we’re going to talk about that and much more. [MUSIC PLAYING] And we’re back. So given everything we’ve just discussed, what kind of position does this put America in? Ross, this was the subject of a column that you wrote this week. Do you want to walk us through your thinking?

ross douthat

Such as it is, yeah. I think that I started the column by talking about George W. Bush’s “Axis of Evil.” speech. And in that speech, Bush famously suggested that there was some kind of alignment between Iran and North Korea and Iraq that was, in some way, parallel to the alignment between imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. He didn’t make this claim overtly because it, obviously, wasn’t true. It was more of a rhetorical flourish. But I think at this point, we are closer to facing, the United States, a real alignment of hostile rival powers. If you look at Russia’s ambitions in Ukraine, China’s ambitions towards Taiwan, and, frankly, Iran’s role, whatever it may be, in supporting groups like Hamas in the Middle East. You’ve got three different theaters where powers that are basically sort of anti-American now in orientation are interested in the end of American hegemony, are all either making moves or seemingly, in China’s case, contemplating moves that America kind of has to play defense against. We, I think, are entirely correct to be supportive of Israel in the situation and to support their right and duty to go after Hamas. But in terms of our own grand strategy, we also have to read events in Israel in light of events in Ukraine, in light of possible events around Taiwan. And somehow balance our various responses to these revisionist powers in a way that doesn’t squander our resources and makes it possible for us to defend as much as possible Israel’s position, Ukraine’s position, and Taiwan’s position, which is a hard thing to do.

michelle cottle

Well, this is one of the things you see coming up through Congress are members pitching a package of aid from the US that wraps all three of those theaters in together. And one of the problems is, you have a split in the Republican conference about whether or not that’s a good thing. But it is something that people are trying to figure their way through.

carlos lozada

When I first heard the news of what was happening in Israel of the attack by Hamas, one of my first thoughts, even as you’re sort of absorbing the horror of it, was, “God, I wonder if China would choose this moment to make a move.” It just seemed like with the Biden administration having expressed such a firm commitment toward Ukraine and expressing a similar commitment toward Israel, it raises a question of exactly how committed can you be on how many fronts? Ross, your column inspired me to go read the Biden administration’s national security strategy document from 2022.

ross douthat

I imagine it had that effect on most readers of The New York Times, in fact.

carlos lozada

And the sort of multipolarity dealing with challenges from so many sides and so many powers is pretty explicitly acknowledged there. I don’t think we need to read a lot of tea leaves. At the very beginning, in the president’s voice, it says the post-Cold War era, meaning the era of the unipolar moment. The post-Cold War era is definitively over and a competition is underway between the major powers to shape what comes next. Biden still says we’re the leading power, but he recognizes we’re not the only game in town. And his biggest concern really seems to be China. He says Russia poses an immediate threat, an ongoing security threat in Europe. But it lacks the across-the-spectrum capabilities of the PRC. And so, to me, that was a useful way to anchor the moment. And thank you to your column for pushing me there.

lydia polgreen

Well, I think the other thing that I’ve been thinking about is just this notion of are we or are we not living in a quote, unquote, “rules-based order.” I’ve obviously written a fair bit about this, what feels like a kind of “might makes right” moment. The questions about what level of violence and civilian casualties will be tolerated in that pursuit, it goes right along all of the other big questions that we’re asking about what price are we willing to pay in order to solve these major, major global crises? So yeah, I don’t know. What’s the state of the rules-based order at this particular moment, would you say?

ross douthat

Aspirational.

carlos lozada

Yeah.

lydia polgreen

Aspirational, yes.

michelle cottle

Tenuous.

ross douthat

No, yeah, I think what you’re seeing is certainly — there’s obviously a long-running debate about to what extent said rules-based order ever fully existed. But clearly, there’s a sense in a lot of places that there are opportunities to settle business that was difficult to settle at a different stage of American power. We’re basically watching a kind of ethnic cleansing happen in Azerbaijan, where Armenians living in disputed territory are fleeing and that’s getting basically no attention. And I think even the Hamas stuff, when the Islamic State was perpetrating its atrocities, there was a sense of this as this kind of total exception. It’s like, all right, this is the re-emergence of, people would always say, medieval barbarism. I think that is sort of pejorative against the Middle Ages. There are plenty of medieval authorities who would have condemned what the Islamic State did. But there was this definite sense of it sort of exceptionalism, was this kind of eruption of the barbaric past into the present. And Hamas, as much as they are a terrorist group, had been more normalized. And for them to go full Islamic State also feels like they wouldn’t have done it in a context where the international order felt more stable.

michelle cottle

I think there is obviously a big calculation going on with other powers trying to figure out just how distracted the US is, not only by its foreign matters, but also kind of what’s going on here at home. Obviously, Putin and others have been happy to point to all of the domestic Sturm und Drang over the last few years and say, this is not a well-run democracy. Projecting strength and stability isn’t really what we’ve done in the last few years. And that has to just make everything that much more likely to fall apart elsewhere.

ross douthat

You’re saying that removing a Speaker of the House for no particular reason in the midst of —

michelle cottle

I’m saying that —

ross douthat

— global crisis is not a signal of strength?

michelle cottle

— storming the Capitol, trying to overthrow an election and being unable to actually have a functioning Congress, yeah, all of those things are bad, in terms of telegraphing American stability.

lydia polgreen

But it’s also — agreed, but I also think that we’re in good company. What was happening in Israel at the time that right before this happened, as this huge threat is gathering, there is a giant fight over what I would certainly describe as a huge judicial power grab by Netanyahu. And there were really, really powerful warnings from people who were high up in the military or who had served were saying, this is causing division. This is going to have an impact on our security. And so you definitely see that come true. And so I’m just thinking about the episode that we did last week. You have Matt Gaetz, the Congressman from Florida, who started this whole process of removing Speaker Kevin McCarthy over, yeah, maybe principle, but also just kind of a personal beef. And there is this sort of reminder that we have a lot of very unserious politics happening at a time when the world just feels incredibly deadly, deadly serious.

michelle cottle

We also have an element of the Republican Party that Trump has kind of spoken to, which is increasingly isolationist. You’ve seen it with Ron DeSantis talking about Ukraine. You have JD Vance and Josh Hawley, who are arguing constantly for ramping back aid to Ukraine. There is this element, that has gotten a little bit of a boost, that they want American out of Foreign Affairs and not policing the world. And I think that is something that has to be factored in as well.

ross douthat

I think, though, that what you see already in the response to events in Israel is how limited that kind of non-interventionism is to the specifics of the Ukraine conflict. A lot of those guys have made the argument that we are over invested in Ukraine and underinvested in China. They’re basically Asia-first Republicans. And the first thing Josh Hawley said after the atrocities in Israel was we should take Ukraine money, not send it home to build firehouses or bridges or something, but send it to Israel, which was a ridiculous bit of pandering, in a way or sort of made-for-Twitter moment. But also I think reflective of the fact that the number of true isolationists in the Republican Party is relatively small. And when it’s Israel in the crosshairs, where the Republican Party has been deeply invested for my entire political lifetime, you’re less likely to get people wanting to pull back.

michelle cottle

Yeah, although I would argue that that’s more because Israel has become a litmus test of sorts on the right more than Ukraine, say, being the outlier. Israel has a very special place in the Republican Party and American foreign policy anyway, that is more unique.

ross douthat

Yeah, I think the open question is, what would actually happen if Taiwan was threatened? Because right now, you have a lot of elite-level Republicans who are skeptical of aid to Ukraine but favorable to support for Taiwan. I don’t know what the popular support on the right, but, more generally, would be for Taiwan in the event of a real conflict. I think that’s something that just hasn’t been tested.

lydia polgreen

No, but let me ask you guys this. I think one of the pieces of received wisdom that I think is basically right is that Xi Jinping, the absolute ruler of China, had been somewhat chastened by the way things have gone for Putin in Ukraine. But I wonder if any of you have thoughts on who are the international actors that are looking at this situation and what lessons do you think they’re going to draw from it, based on the variety of ways that we could respond to it?

carlos lozada

I think it’s often tempting and easy to think of geopolitics as individual leaders straddling their country kind of looking at what everyone else is doing and this kind of multi-complicated chessboard. But a lot of it is just a response to what’s going on in their own countries, their own sense of themselves, as leaders. I recently read a good book called “Party of One, the Rise of Xi Jinping and China’s Superpower Future,” by Chun Han Wong of The Wall Street Journal. And it makes the case, pretty clearly, how there’s this deep sense of mission and destiny for Xi Jinping, surrounding Taiwan. And I think that, regardless of what’s happening with Putin here, what’s happening with Israel over there, that kind of impetus is overpowering sometimes. And you can tell yourself a story about the international environment that suits what you want to do anyway.

lydia polgreen

And it also feels like the ability of any one player, even a player as powerful, even in our diminished moment, as the United States, can’t control for all those variables. And events are going to unfold in the ways that they’re going to unfold. So being in the business of prediction and mind reading is not a good place for any of us to be, at this moment.

ross douthat

I will say something maybe not — optimistic is the wrong word for it, but at least non-despairing, which is that we’re in a moment where countries that are revisionist in their ambitions that want to end American hegemony and groups, including terrorist groups that they support, all seem emboldened. By the same token, these forces are not by any means carrying all before them. Hamas and Hezbollah are not actually capable of defeating Israel. And I don’t believe that they will defeat Israel. Russia has not proven itself capable of defeating Ukraine. China’s capacities in war are untested and there are good reasons to believe, even now, in the resilience of some form — I’m hedging my bets here — but some form of the US-led order that we have all lived in for all of our lives. I would say it’s too soon to count that order out.

lydia polgreen

All right, well, we’re going to leave it there. No Hot Cold this week. So take care, you guys.

carlos lozada

See you soon.

ross douthat

Take care.

michelle cottle

244,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/12/world/middleeast/blinken-us-aid-israel-netanyahu.html,"Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken stood next to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Thursday at a military base in Tel Aviv and promised to help defend Israel “as long as America exists.”

But he also suggested the need for restraint in Israel’s military strikes in Gaza after deadly Hamas attacks over the weekend, saying “it’s important to take every possible precaution to prevent harming civilians.”

Mr. Blinken said the main message from President Biden was that “we will always be there by your side.”

“Too often in the past, leaders have equivocated in the face of terrorist attacks against Israel and its people,” Mr. Blinken said. “This is — this must be — a moment for moral clarity.”"
245,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/opinion/israel-military-war.html,"I was in Austin, Texas, for work on Saturday when I received a call from my commander in the Israel Defense Forces to return to Israel and head to the front line. I didn’t hesitate. I knew that the citizens of my country were in real danger. My duty first and foremost is to join the fight against those who unleashed a massacre on my people. I boarded the first flight I found out of Austin to head home to join the I.D.F. reserves, where I serve as a brigade operations command officer.

During my long flight to Israel, my mind couldn’t rest. I was trying to write down my feelings and thoughts about everything happening — and everything that’s about to happen — in my beloved country.

Little by little, the dimensions of the horrors of the most brutal attack that Israelis have experienced since the establishment of the state were being revealed. Hundreds of Hamas terrorists slaughtered more than 1,200 people, including women, children and older people. About 150 citizens and soldiers have been taken captive. There’s nothing in the world that can justify the murder of hundreds of innocent people.

But I’d like to say one thing clearly, before I go to battle: There’s no such thing as “unavoidable.” This war could have been avoided, and no one did enough to prevent it. Israel did not do enough to make peace; we just conquered the Palestinian territories in the West Bank, expanded the illegal settlements and imposed a long-term siege on the Gaza Strip."
246,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/world/middleeast/israel-missing-americans-help.html,"Relatives of four American citizens who are missing or believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas during Saturday’s attacks on Israel pleaded with authorities in the United States and Israel to help find and bring back their loved ones in a news conference in Tel Aviv on Tuesday.

“I think after more than three days now it is more than a reasonable request to have somebody from the Israeli government or the U.S. administration approach us with any type of information,” said Nahar Neta, whose mother, Adrienne, has been missing since Saturday morning.

Mr. Neta fought back tears as he described being on the phone trying to calm his 66-year-old mother, who was born and raised in California, as Saturday’s attack unfolded. His siblings were on the phone with her as attackers broke into her home in Be’eri, a kibbutz near the border with Gaza. He said they heard screaming and have not heard from her since.

“It is our hope, which is a little bit ridiculous at this stage to say, that the optimistic scenario here is that she’s held hostage in Gaza and not dead on the street of the kibbutz where we grew up,” he said."
247,https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000009125478/israel-hamas-missing-americans.html,"“I’m here speaking today and reaching out to my son, Sagui, who grew up on the kibbutz — Sagui Dekel-Chen. And he’s an arm’s length away in Gaza, evidently, but couldn’t be farther from me and our family right now. Do appeal to the United States government, to the Congress, to do what they can on the side of good here. We’re waiting for Sagui to come home. We do not know what fate he met, along, as I said, with dozens of other people from the kibbutz. And just so you understand, these aren’t all 35-year-old men. These are children. These are aged people and everything in between.” “Hopefully, with your help, the people here will help us amplify this message to the U.S. government, Secretary of State that until now have been saying all of the right things. But we do — at least, I on behalf of my family — I’m asking the U.S. not to take a back seat.”"
248,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/us/politics/trump-gaza-refugees-travel-ban.html,"Former President Donald J. Trump, in remarks that invoked the deadly Hamas attacks on Israel to stoke fears of terrorism at home, said on Monday that he would expand a freeze on refugees that he enacted during his presidency to cover people from the Palestinian territory of Gaza.

In an extension of the anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiments he channeled during his 2016 presidential run and made a cornerstone of his administration, Mr. Trump offered a litany of proposals that in many ways adapted his previous policies to reflect current events. He promised again to bar people from certain parts of the world, particularly where Islam is most commonly practiced, while curbing immigration and the overall number of refugees the United States would take in.

“We aren’t bringing in anyone from Gaza,” Mr. Trump said at a rally in Clive, Iowa, a suburb of Des Moines.

Referring to recent demonstrations protesting Israel’s retaliatory bombardment of Gaza and supporting civilians in the region caught up in conflict, Mr. Trump promised to send Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to what he called “pro-jihadist” rallies. He also proposed that immigrants be denied entry to the United States if they adhered to a laundry list of ideologies."
249,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/11/world/middleeast/congress-netanyahu-israel.html,"Four U.S. lawmakers met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other government leaders in Israel on Tuesday, in what they described as a show of solidarity after Hamas’s surprise attacks over the weekend.

“We stand shoulder to shoulder so that we can go toe to toe with any terrorist going forward,” Representative Jimmy Panetta, Democrat of California, said during a news conference in Israel. “It is from our solidarity that we have our strength.”

The bipartisan delegation to Israel, comprising three representatives and a senator, arrived after lawmakers made stops elsewhere in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. The trip was organized to promote the expansion of recent agreements to normalize relations between Israel and Arab countries. During stops in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, the lawmakers also met with the opposition leader, Yair Lapid, and Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, who previously served as Israel’s ambassador to the United States.

Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa and the leader of the trip, said in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that the group had also met with families affected by the attacks on Saturday and with American citizens in Israel.

Representatives Donald Norcross of New Jersey and Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, both Democrats, were also part of the delegation that stopped in Israel.

Ms. Wasserman Schultz said in a post on X that the group had decided to go through with the Israel visit to “demonstrate our solidarity and support for the U.S.-Israel relationship, to make sure that we acted not just with our words but with our deeds.”

In an interview on CNN on Tuesday, Ms. Wasserman Schultz said that the delegation had been in Saudi Arabia when Hamas fighters first broke through barriers encircling the Gaza Strip on Saturday and attacked nearby Israeli towns, where they killed hundreds of civilians and took scores of hostages. She added that Saudi officials told her the events had not deterred them from pursuing normalization of relations with Israel.

The United States has been trying to broker a deal with Saudi Arabia and Israel, but the arrangement is likely to be contingent on matters like uranium enrichment, weapons sales and Palestinians’ territorial rights. Last week, days before Hamas’s assault, a group of Democratic senators indicated that the guarantees to Palestinians would need to be significant for them to support a treaty. After last weekend, Mr. Netanyahu’s government is less likely to meet those demands.

Since Hamas’s initial strikes, Israeli leaders have ordered a full siege of the Gaza Strip, curtailing supplies of food, fuel, water and electricity to the population of two million Palestinians, and ordered a mass mobilization of reservists in anticipation of a retaliatory offensive."
250,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/world/israel-hamas-attack-reaction.html,"Israel’s news sites are compiling their own lists of the dead and the missing. Funerals are taking place all around the country. After a weekend of attacks, confusion and chaos, the scale of the tragedy that has befallen Israel was coming into sharper focus on Monday.

The main television channels were broadcasting the latest news around the clock, interspersed with the harrowing stories of people who had escaped with their lives after hundreds of heavily armed Hamas fighters surged across the border from Gaza in a surprise attack on Saturday morning. The gunmen overran villages along the border, killing soldiers and civilians in their path and took dozens of others, including infants and grandmothers, back into Gaza as hostages.

As the death toll on the Israeli side rose to over 700, many in the country were describing the events that unfolded on Saturday as their country’s 9/11, or Pearl Harbor. It was a day of dark records: the worst attack on civilians in Israeli history and the deadliest single day in the country’s 75-year history.

Politicians and military officials have tried to deflect the tough questions — how they could have been caught so off-guard and unprepared, why families under siege were left to fend for themselves for hours, why official information about hostages has been elusive — saying that now is the time to focus on fighting back."
251,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/world/middleeast/peace-activists-killed-israel.html,"On the Israeli side of the Gaza border lie a number of residential collectives whose members tend to be left of center and supportive of peace initiatives and Palestinian rights. Many of those residents were among the missing or dead after Hamas’s assault on Saturday.

Vivian Silver, 74, a member of Kibbutz Be’eri, near the northern end of Gaza, was still missing on Monday night and presumed to have been taken hostage. Ms. Silver, a native of Winnipeg, Manitoba, was among the leaders of Women Wage Peace, a large grass-roots movement founded in the aftermath of the Gaza War of 2014 to promote a political resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

She served for many years on the board of directors of B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization that said Israel was an apartheid state. She made visits to the occupied territories to express solidarity with Palestinians and volunteered with an organization that drove sick Palestinians from Gaza into Israel for medical treatment. She is the executive director of the Negev Institute for Strategies of Peace and Development and co-founded the Arab Jewish Center for Equality Empowerment and Cooperation.

One of her sons, Yonatan Zeigen, told the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz that he last communicated with her on Saturday morning, when she said she was hiding in a closet in a safe room on the kibbutz. They started to text rather than speak as the sound of shooting got closer, but there was no communication from her after 11:07 a.m., he said.

Ms. Silver is “probably worried sick about the Palestinian contacts in her phone, a friend wrote on Facebook. “She probably thinks of the danger they will now face for being seen as collaborators with the enemy.”

That peace-oriented Israelis were among Hamas’s targets has fueled further resentment of the Netanyahu government, which was caught by surprise on Saturday when Hamas fighters from the Gaza Strip streamed into Israel on Saturday, meeting little resistance.

Some Israelis said that, by contrast, the country’s military forces had been beefed up to protect settlers in the West Bank, who have clashed repeatedly with Palestinian residents.

Rachel Gur, an Israeli involved in the search for the missing, said that many of the residents of the collectives near Gaza had similar politics. “These are kibbutzniks, the people who vote for the left, who support coexistence,” she said. “You’re talking about the old time secular leftists, who want peace, who are against annexation.”

Another peace activist, Hayim Katsman, was initially believed to have been taken hostage on Saturday but was found killed in his home on Kibbutz Holit, near the southern end of Gaza. He had studied conservative trends and radicalism within the Zionist religious community, and played bass guitar and worked as a D.J. playing Arabic music.

He did gardening and landscaping at Kibbutz Holit, his mother, Hannah Wacholder Katsman, said. He had also worked as a mechanic, and taught at various colleges and pre-army programs. On her Facebook page, she mourned him as “beautiful, generous and talented.” He was also “very industrious and independent,” she said in a text message on Monday.

Mr. Katsman recently completed his doctorate at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he won an award for the best graduate paper in the Association for Israel Studies. During his time there, he served as co-coordinator of the Israel-Palestine research group at the university.

His doctorate was titled, “Religious nationalism in Israel/Palestine.” It is unusual for Israelis to refer to the region in that way, rather than simply as “Israel,” or “Israel and the occupied territories.”

Bilha and Yakovi Inon, who were peace activists and the parents of a prominent activist, Maoz Inon, were also killed on Saturday. The couple were killed in their farming collective, of Netiv Ha’Asara, which lies just north of Gaza."
252,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/15/world/middleeast/israel-invasion-gaza-humanitarian-crisis.html,"Israel’s retaliatory strikes have killed at least 2,670 people in Gaza over the past week, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Palestinian news media reported on Sunday that an Israeli strike on a home in Rafah, near the closed Egypt border crossing, had killed at least 17 members of a family.

Israeli officials said over the weekend that of the 1,300 people killed in Israel by Hamas militants during the Oct. 7 raid, at least 258 were Israeli soldiers. Israel’s hospitals reported on Sunday that 377 people were still being treated for injuries sustained in the Hamas attacks.

Amid the mounting death toll, geopolitics hovered over the conflict. Israel’s operations in Gaza came under criticism both by its neighbor Egypt, and by China.

Both countries used similar language in their criticism. Just before his meeting on Sunday with the U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt said that Israel’s attack on Gaza had exceeded “the right of self-defense” and turned into “a collective punishment,” according to The Associated Press.

The meeting between Mr. Blinken and Mr. el-Sisi became personal when the president criticized the secretary for saying last week that, as a Jew, he had been deeply affected by the Hamas attacks. Mr. Blinken responded by saying, “I come as a human being appalled by the atrocities by Hamas.”"

Israel just ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza, as rockets continue to land on both sides of the border and Israeli forces prepare for a potential ground invasion.

The rapidly escalating war has pushed up oil prices and raised questions about what the conflict means for the global economy, President Biden’s push to normalize diplomatic ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, and gridlock in Congress.

The latest: Israeli stocks and bonds fell after the attacks, and many businesses and schools in the country remain closed, while airlines have curtailed most flights to Tel Aviv. Israel’s central bank also said it will sell up to $30 billion worth of foreign reserves to shore up the shekel.

The U.S. pledged to send additional munitions and military assets to Israel and is moving Navy warships closer to Israel in a show of support."
254,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/briefing/hamas-israel-war.html,"The simplest explanation is that the world is in the midst of a transition to a new order that experts describe with the word multipolar. The United States is no longer the dominant power it once was, and no replacement has emerged. As a result, political leaders in many places feel emboldened to assert their own interests, believing the benefits of aggressive action may outweigh the costs. These leaders believe that they have more sway over their own region than the U.S. does.

“A fully multipolar world has emerged, and people are belatedly realizing that multipolarity involves quite a bit of chaos,” Noah Smith wrote in his Substack newsletter on Saturday.

Zheng Yongnian, a Chinese political scientist with ties to the country’s leaders, has similarly described the “old order” as disintegrating. “Countries are brimming with ambition, like tigers eyeing their prey, keen to find every opportunity among the ruins of the old order,” Zheng wrote last year.

A weaker U.S. …

Why has American power receded? Some of the change is unavoidable. Dominant countries don’t remain dominant forever. But the U.S. has also made strategic mistakes that are accelerating the arrival of a multipolar world.

Among those mistakes: Presidents of both parties naïvely believed that a richer China would inevitably be a friendlier China — and failed to recognize that the U.S. was building up its own rival through lenient trade policies, as the political scientist John Mearsheimer has argued. In Afghanistan and Iraq, the U.S. spent much of the early 21st century fighting costly wars. The Iraq war was especially damaging because it was an unprovoked war that George W. Bush chose to start. And the humiliating retreat from Afghanistan, overseen by President Biden, made the U.S. look weaker still."

The Israeli government approved the call-up of an additional 60,000 reservists, officials said, raising the total number of mobilized soldiers over the last three days to 360,000, the most in such a short period since the country’s founding. The mobilization has touched nearly every corner of the country of 10 million, which has been plunged into anguish by the killing of more than 1,000 people in the attacks since Saturday.

With the border nearly secured on Tuesday — even as rocket attacks from Gaza continued and some firefights broke out — the scale of the horror unleashed on towns and villages near Gaza was rapidly coming into focus. In one kibbutz a mile and a half from Gaza, journalists with The New York Times saw Israeli soldiers carrying slain residents on stretchers, and more than a dozen bloated bodies lying on the ground."

Mr. Kiattisak, 35, was working on a kibbutz near the Gaza Strip. His family fears he may have been abducted on Sunday morning, said Kanjana Patee, his sister.

Thailand supplies the bulk of labor for Israel’s agriculture industry, and Mr. Kiattisak was one of 30,000 Thai citizens working in Israel, according to the foreign ministry. Many of them are underpaid and forced to work long hours, according to Human Rights Watch, which cited interviews with Thai workers.

But international law offers a framework for how to analyze what is happening, even while atrocities and deaths from the Hamas incursion are still being documented, and the consequences of Israel’s siege and airstrikes on the crowded Gaza Strip, home to millions of civilians, continue to unfold. New information is coming out every day. Details will take time to verify, misinformation is already widespread, and it can be easy to get bogged down in debates over unconfirmed allegations. The laws of war offer a guide to what matters most, and to what should happen next.

Two principles are particularly helpful. The first is that the “why” and the “how” of war are separate legal questions. The justice or injustice of a cause of war does not change the obligation to fight it according to the rules of humanitarian law.

The second, related principle, from which much of humanitarian law derives, is that civilians are entitled to protection. Armies and other armed groups cannot target them directly. Nor can they disproportionately harm them in the course of pursuing legitimate military goals. And those obligations still apply even if the other side violates them by targeting civilians themselves."

But then, Israel was so fundamental to their lives and family — both mother and daughter have deep ties there, while making their home in the Chicago suburbs — that the visit was more an evocation of things familiar than a landmark exploration of something new.

That celebration was transformed a week ago into an unimaginably dark and violent nightmare. When Hamas terrorists invaded Israel in a surprise assault, they swept into the kibbutz where Judith and Natalie were staying, less than a mile from the Gaza border. According to relatives, Natalie and Judith attempted to hide in a shelter, but they disappeared in the chaos and are believed to have been taken hostage by attackers.

Water and electricity have been cut off, Adnan Abu Hasna, the media adviser for the U.N. agency that helps Palestinian refugees, said in a phone interview from Gaza City. The only power plant in Gaza shut down on Wednesday because the blockade enforced by Egypt and Israel has prevented shipments of fuel.

Hospitals were running short on fuel to keep backup generators running, he said, compounding fears of a humanitarian disaster as patients pour in for treatment amid Israeli airstrikes that have killed hundreds. And without reliable electricity, residents had no means of storing food.

“We are facing a huge disaster,” he said.

After Hamas assailants killed at least 1,200 people in Israel and took an estimated 150 hostages, Israeli authorities have vowed that no humanitarian aid would be allowed into Gaza. Egypt, which also borders Gaza, has not indicated whether it will allow emergency aid shipments into the territory.

Israel’s defense minister ordered a “complete siege” of the long-blockaded Gaza Strip yesterday, as Israeli forces battled Palestinian assailants in border towns for a third day and launched retaliatory strikes that hit hundreds of sites in Gaza, including mosques and a marketplace.

Hamas, the militant group controlling Gaza, threatened to execute a civilian hostage every time an airstrike hit Gazans “in their homes without warning.” At least 150 Israelis have been taken hostage by Palestinian assailants since the brazen incursion on Saturday. A Hamas spokesman added that the group will not negotiate the issue of prisoners while the fighting with Israel is ongoing. Here’s what we know about the captives.

Israel’s army regained control of border communities, the country’s chief military spokesman said, but he acknowledged that “there may still be terrorists in the area.” Lt. Col. Richard Hecht of the Israel Defense Forces said in a briefing yesterday that the fighting continued, adding: “We thought by this morning we’d be in a better place.”

The same day, the dean of the law school, Troy A. McKenzie, repudiated the student’s remarks. “This message was not from N.Y.U. School of Law as an institution and does not speak for the leadership of the law school,” Mr. McKenzie wrote.

In a statement to The Times, the law school said: “For legal reasons, we cannot comment on the specifics of any current student who may be under investigation. Speaking generally, all complaints of bias and/or discriminatory behavior are investigated thoroughly and in accordance with federal, state, and local guidelines, and the appropriate disciplinary action follows the outcome of that process.”

They include civilians, soldiers, people with disabilities, children, grandparents and even a 9-month-old baby. The hostages are also believed to include at least one Palestinian resident of Israel, a bus driver who spent the night near the outdoor party after driving Israelis there, his family said.

The capture of so many Israelis by Palestinian militants has taken the Israeli-Palestinian conflict into uncharted territory — not only in the sheer number of hostages, but also in the dire threats Hamas is making against them.

In the second of two statements on the conflict, the university condemned “the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas” as “abhorrent,” and said that the student groups didn’t speak for the institution.

Mr. Griffin wasn’t alone in demanding that an elite university denounce its students for criticizing Israel so soon after the Hamas attack. Though some complaints — like that from Harvard’s former president, Larry Summers — were made in public, the most intense demands have come behind the scenes from Wall Street financiers who make up a powerful block of donors to schools including the University of Pennsylvania, New York University, Stanford University and Cornell University.

In conversations with The New York Times, more than a dozen donors said they felt they had a right and an obligation to weigh in. Some of the donors who discussed the matter asked not to be named, because they did not want to speak publicly on a rapidly evolving issue that has elicited death threats on both sides. Some, but not all, of these donors are Jewish, though they hold a range of religious beliefs and not all have a history of being active in pro-Israeli causes.

Years of fund-raising campaigns have led the schools to hew ever closer to this big-moneyed group: Harvard, whose endowment has swelled to nearly $51 billion, named its Graduate School of Arts and Sciences after Mr. Griffin.

But the latest eruption of violence in Israel also ripped open a chasm between donors and the students and administrators that their largess helps fund.

Several homes were burned out. Inside, bullet holes riddled some of the ceilings. An unexploded grenade lay under a kitchen table.

This was the scene of some of the worst bloodshed on Saturday, after gunmen surged across the border from Gaza, a mile and a half to the west, gunning down an unknown number of the village’s 750 residents.

Of all the people he spoke to, he said, those most devastated were either people who had lost close friends or family, or young Jews “completely shattered by the response of their lefty friends in New York,” who were either justifying Hamas’s atrocities or celebrating them outright.

This sense of deep betrayal is not limited to New York. Many progressive Jews have been profoundly shaken by the way some on the left are treating the terrorist mass murder of civilians as noble acts of anticolonial resistance. These are Jews who share the left’s abhorrence of the occupation of Gaza and of the enormities inflicted on it, which are only going to get worse if and when Israel invades. But the way keyboard radicals have condoned war crimes against Israelis has left many progressive Jews alienated from political communities they thought were their own.

By now, you’ve probably seen examples. There was the giddy message put out by the national committee of Students for Justice in Palestine, which proclaimed, “Today, we witness a historic win for the Palestinian resistance: across land, air and sea.” New York’s chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America promoted a rally where speakers applauded the attacks, and the Connecticut D.S.A. enthused, “Yesterday, the Palestinian resistance launched an unprecedented anticolonial struggle.” The president of N.Y.U.’s student bar association wrote in its newsletter, “I will not condemn Palestinian resistance,” leading to the withdrawal of a job offer. Over the otherwise benign slogan “I stand with Palestine,” Black Lives Matter Chicago posted a photo of a figure in a paraglider like those Hamas used to descend on a desert rave and turn it into a killing field.

Various Palestinian factions in Lebanon have claimed responsibility for attacks this week into Israeli territory, prompting retaliatory strikes from Israel. But it is Lebanon’s most powerful militant organization, Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Shiite group committed to the destruction of the Jewish state, that remains the most serious threat to Israel.

With its vast arsenal of rockets and thousands of experienced fighters who gained combat experience in neighboring Syria’s civil war, Hezbollah has long been seen in Israel as a formidable fighting force. Founded in 1985 to fight the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, has grown into a powerful organization whose leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has also transformed the group into an influential political force inside the country.

Israel briefly invaded Lebanon in 2006 after Hezbollah assailants crossed the border and abducted two Israeli soldiers, prompting a war that left parts of the country in ruins. Despite occasional skirmishes in the years since, border tensions have remained relatively contained."

“As you might have seen, there was some sort of rave or desert party where they were having a great time, until the resistance came in electrified hang gliders and took at least several dozen hipsters,” a speaker said. “But I’m sure they’re doing very fine despite what The New York Post says.” He was met with cheers.

I went to see the rally for myself: Would there be even perfunctory condemnation of Hamas’s methods? A brief nod of sympathy to Israel’s anguish? Some banal nod to the cause of peace and nonviolence? Not that I heard. What I saw was giddiness and gloating, as if someone’s team had won the World Cup. Hamas had perpetrated the largest single-day massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, and the crowd was euphoric.

Similar scenes unfolded across the world. In London, an estimated 5,000 demonstrators gathered near the Israeli embassy and shot off fireworks toward the building. At a rally at the Sydney Opera House in Australia, chants of “Free Palestine” gave way to the underlying emotion: “Fuck the Jews.” At Harvard, almost three dozen campus groups issued a joint statement holding “the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.” A statement from Yalies4Palestine insisted that “Breaking out of a prison requires force, not desperate appeals to the colonizer.”"

The war that began with a Hamas assault that has taken as many as 700 Israeli lives is not an existential struggle for the survival of the Israeli state itself, as were the 1948 war triggered by Israel’s foundation or the 1973 Yom Kippur War. But 75 years, and a half-century, respectively, from those conflicts, the sight of villages once again overrun, hostages seized and desperate civilians being killed by Palestinian militants has awakened a kind of primal dread.

“Israelis are shaken to the core,” said Yuval Shany, a professor of international law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “There is outrage at Hamas, but also at the political and military leadership that allowed this to happen. You would expect a state this strong to prevent such things, yet 75 years from Israel’s creation the government has failed in its principal responsibility: the protection of the lives of its citizens.”

As with the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War, disbelief has mingled with anger at a colossal intelligence failure."

The people of Israel lived through one such moment this weekend. The bloody hands of the terrorist organization Hamas, a group whose stated purpose for being is to kill Jews. This was an act of sheer evil. More than 1,000 civilians slaughtered, not just killed, slaughtered, in Israel. The brutality of Hamas, these — blood-thirstiness brings to mind the worst, the worst rampages of ISIS. This is terrorism. So in this moment, we must be crystal clear: We stand with Israel."

Tour operators and cruise lines are also changing itineraries to avoid Israel or canceling trips all together.

Though Ben Gurion Airport, Israel’s main international airport, located just outside Tel Aviv, has remained open since the fighting first erupted, hundreds of flights have been delayed and canceled. On Tuesday evening local time, there were 131 flight cancellations and 90 delays, according to FlightAware, a tracking service.

In the United States, American Airlines announced the cancellation of all flights to and from Tel Aviv through Dec. 4 and Delta Air Lines said it would suspend all flights to and from Israel through the remainder of this month. United Airlines has discontinued service indefinitely.

Several European carriers, including Air France, Finnair and TAP Air Portugal, have also temporarily halted direct flights to and from Israel.

Government agencies across the globe, including the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States, have urged operators to exercise caution when flying in Israeli airspace given the explosive conflict. Israel’s Civil Aviation Authority advised airlines to prepare for delays when calculating fuel needs.

With a number of American citizens in Israel, the U.S. State Department has asked airlines to consider re-establishing air routes.

“We have also been in conversation with various carriers to encourage them to consider resuming travel in and out of Israel, and we’ll continue to do that,” said Matthew Miller, a State Department spokesman, at a news briefing on Tuesday.

There were about 6,700 international flights into Israel scheduled for this month, the bulk of which are operated by El Al, Israel’s national airline, according to data from aviation-analytics company Cirium. In July, about 37,000 passengers flew into Israel daily, with travelers from the United States representing the largest share at more than 3,800 passengers, according to Cirium data.

El Al said on its website that flights were being operated as scheduled and that the airline was offering flexible cancellations to customers. The airline is also adding flight service from additional destinations to get people home to Israel.

The U.S. Department of State has not prohibited travel to the Israel or to the West Bank, but said that travelers should exercise increased caution upon visiting either of these places. Americans should not enter Gaza, the federal agency said.

Tour operators with excursions to Israel have also altered itineraries. Collette, a tour company with headquarters in Rhode Island, said it was canceling all remaining trips to Israel this year.

Most major cruise lines with scheduled port calls in Israel over the next month are forgoing stops in the Israeli cities of Ashdod and Haifa for ports in Turkey and Greece. Some trips embarking from Israel, like Royal Caribbean’s Rhapsody of the Seas, have been canceled entirely through the end of October.

276,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/us/politics/israel-hamas-intelligence.html,"The devastating surprise attack by Hamas on Saturday represented an equally stunning intelligence failure by Israel that involved undetected warnings, overwhelmed missile defenses and a slow response by apparently unprepared military forces, former and current U.S. officials said.

American officials said Hamas had achieved a complete tactical surprise, reflected in a death toll of at least 700 Israelis. The Palestinian militant group sent hundreds of fighters through breached walls, breaking through with bulldozers and then killing civilians and soldiers in shooting sprees that went on for hours.

None of Israel’s intelligence services had specific warning that Hamas was preparing a sophisticated attack that required coordinated land, air and sea strikes, according to an Israeli defense official and American officials. While the attack also surprised many Western intelligence agencies, they do not track Hamas’s activities as closely as Israel or Egypt do.

The success astounded American officials with experience in the region. Over the years, Israel has set up a network of electronic intercepts, sensors and human informants throughout Gaza, which is about half the area of New York’s five boroughs. Israel and its neighbors have in the past invested heavily in trying to track and block Hamas’s networks, often intercepting shipments of missile components."

So too have false and misleading information, old and unrelated videos and photos with inaccurate claims, and fabricated assertions about the involvement of countries like the United States and Ukraine — adding confusion and deception to an already chaotic moment.

The false information circulating online risks clouding real evidence of atrocities that is emerging as Israeli soldiers retake control of places that were attacked: videos and photos, corroborated by witness accounts, that show that Palestinian gunmen attacked and killed Israeli civilians in large numbers. Soldiers and emergency workers are still recovering the dead, including children, in many communities."

E.U. authorities formally requested information from X, once known as Twitter, the first step in what could become a wider investigation of the company. Regulators are examining whether X violated a new European law, the Digital Services Act, which requires large social media companies to stop the spread of illegal content, disinformation and other harmful material. Under the law, companies can be penalized up to 6 percent of their global revenues.

The war has intensified a simmering dispute between Mr. Musk, who believes in less content moderation on X and has reduced the size of teams that performed those roles, and regulators in the European Union, where free speech protections are more limited than they are in the United States.

“The #DSA is here to protect both freedom of expression & our democracies — including in times of crisis,” Thierry Breton, the European commissioner behind the law, said on X."

Then came a voice over the intercom, commanding them in English and Hebrew to immediately seek shelter.

Mr. Goldman had just joined his wife and three young children, who had traveled to Israel a week earlier for a relative’s bar mitzvah. He stayed behind because of the latest crises in Congress. On Saturday, they had planned to spend the day on a tourist trip to the Dead Sea. Instead, they hurried out of their room in their pajamas, bewildered and fearful, to crowd into an interior stairwell in the Hilton Tel Aviv.

“We waited for about 10 minutes till we got the all-clear,” Mr. Goldman said in an interview Monday, the day after his family returned to New York. “That happened maybe three or four more times Saturday morning, where we went back to our hotel room and then sirens came and we had to go to the stairwell.”

Mr. Goldman, 47, who represents Lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn in Congress, was among a host of officials from the New York area who happened to be in Israel when Hamas launched its surprise multipronged attack from the Gaza Strip, taking at least an estimated 150 Israeli soldiers and civilians to Gaza as hostages. The conflict has within days resulted in hundreds of deaths on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides."
280,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/opinion/israel-hamas-attack-friedman.html,"So they must now conduct this war, make excruciating decisions about trade-offs among deterrence, retaliation, getting hostages back from Hamas and maybe even invading Gaza, knowing all the time that even if they manage all of these perfectly, some kind of inquiry awaits them at the end of the road. It is not easy to think straight under those conditions.

As this column has been pointing out ever since he came back to power, Netanyahu’s politics of division have done terrible damage to Israel. Bibi prioritized a judicial putsch to strip the Israeli Supreme Court of its power to oversee his government — over all other priorities. In the process he fractured Israeli society and its military. And people have been warning for months how dangerous this could be. Just this week I quoted a former director general of the Israeli Defense Ministry, Dan Harel, telling a Tel Aviv democracy rally that “I have never seen our national security in a worse state” and that there has already been damage to the reserve units of essential Israel Defense Forces formations, “which has reduced readiness and operational capability.”

But as bad as Netanyahu has been for Israel, Hamas has been a deadly curse for the Palestinian people since it took over Gaza in 2007. The billion-plus dollars in aid that it received from Qatar alone over the years could have gone into building Gaza into a productive society, with decent schools, universities and infrastructure, that might have been a model for a future Palestinian state with the West Bank. Instead, Hamas has devoted most of its energies and resources to digging tunnels into Israel and building rockets to try to destroy a vastly more powerful enemy — thus depriving Gazans of any chance to realize their full potential, via a government that is decent, democratic and productive.

Why did Hamas launch this war now, without any immediate provocation? One has to wonder if it was not on behalf of the Palestinian people but rather at the behest of Iran, an important supplier of money and arms to Hamas, to help prevent the budding normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia, Iran’s rival, and Israel. Such a deal, as it was being drawn up, would also benefit the more moderate West Bank Palestinian Authority — by delivering to it a huge infusion of cash from Saudi Arabia, as well as curbs on Israeli settlements in the West Bank and other advances to preserve a two-state solution. As a result, West Bank leaders might have earned a desperately needed boost of legitimacy from the Palestinian masses, threatening the legitimacy of Hamas.

That U.S.-Saudi-Israel deal also would have been a diplomatic earthquake that would have most likely required Netanyahu to jettison the most extreme members of his cabinet in return for forging an alliance between the Jewish state and the Sunni-led states of the Persian Gulf against Iran. Altogether, it would have been one of the biggest shifts in the tectonic plates of the region in 75 years. In the wake of this Hamas attack, that deal is now in the deep freeze, as the Saudis have had to link themselves more closely than ever with Palestinian interests, not just their own."

In a speech to NATO, he also criticized Iran for its support of Hamas and Moscow.

It is the second speech that Mr. Zelensky, who spoke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Sunday, has delivered in support of Israel since Hamas’s incursion into Israel. In another sign of the Ukrainian government’s strong backing for Israel, electronic billboards in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, were lit with the Israeli flag on Sunday night.

Mr. Zelensky said that Hamas and Moscow were “the same evil, and the only difference is that there is a terrorist organization that attacked Israel, and here is a terrorist state that attacked Ukraine.”

“If the world unites whenever someone takes women hostage and condemns the children of another nation, terror will have no allies,” he said in a speech delivered by video link to a meeting in Copenhagen of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly."

Mr. Blinken said that the Israeli government had “asked for some specific additional assistance” as the country gears up for what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned will likely be a prolonged conflict.

Mr. Blinken declined to provide additional details about specific weapons systems that might be provided to Israel in the near future.

White House officials said President Biden told Mr. Netanyahu in a call on Sunday that military assistance is on its way to Israel and more will follow in the days ahead. In the latest call between the two leaders, Mr. Biden “discussed the taking of hostages by Hamas terrorists, including entire families, the elderly, and young children,” according to a readout of the call by the White House."
284,https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-gaza-photos.html,"A brief respite in the fighting began in Gaza on Friday after seven weeks of devastating war. As part of the truce agreement, Hamas released two dozen hostages it had been holding in the enclave, and Israel released nearly 40 imprisoned Palestinians. It was the most significant diplomatic breakthrough since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks on Israel prompted a full-blown war.

In all, about 230 people had been taken captive and at least some are believed to be kept in the network of tunnels beneath Gaza City.

As the countdown to the cease-fire began, Israeli airstrikes and ground troops pummeled northern Gaza on Thursday. Numerous clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups were reported in Jabaliya, an area just north of Gaza City that Israeli officials have called a Hamas stronghold.

In Khan Younis, a city in the southern Gaza Strip where many Palestinians have fled to escape Israeli bombardment of the north, 111 bodies wrapped in bright blue bags arrived on Wednesday in a shipping container on the back of a truck.

At the main hospital complex in Gaza City, which has been surrounded by Israeli troops and without power for days, workers at the hospital, Al-Shifa, were digging a mass grave for bodies that have started to decompose, according to the medical authorities in Gaza.

They spoke of fear and shock, solidarity and helplessness, a newfound bond with some friends and an estrangement from others. Like many young people, they are still sorting out how they see the world, and what might have felt certain a week ago — about friends, values and identity — has been upended by the events in Israel and Gaza.

A 19-year-old in Washington said he has been responding to texts from his former campers asking if he knew whether fellow counselors of his from Israel, who spent the summer at their Jewish overnight camp in Wisconsin, were still alive. A high school senior on Long Island said she had grown nervous about explaining the Hebrew letters on her necklace to people who asked about it at the smoothie place where she works. A college senior in Philadelphia said he was reluctant now to express his criticism of the Israeli government’s policies toward Palestinians, having seen that people who said similar things were being doxxed or accused of supporting Hamas.

Nearly all of the people interviewed talked about a kind of aloneness, a sense that a chasm had appeared between their network of Jewish friends and family and the non-Jewish world around them. While young Jewish people have started fund-raisers or joined letter-writing drives, they saw no comparable urgency among their peers."
286,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-hamas-attack.html,"And the violence came 50 years and a day after the Yom Kippur War of 1973, when Israel was also surprised by an Arab attack on multiple fronts, leading to huge Israeli losses and soul-searching about the state of the country.

The shock of the attack appeared to rekindle a sense of unity among Israelis, as government critics who had resigned from reserve duty in protest of the judicial plan announced they would return to service in Israel’s hour of need. Yair Lapid, the centrist leader of the opposition, announced he was prepared to join a government of national unity — a move that would potentially postpone any further judicial changes and allow Mr. Netanyahu to end his alliance with the far right.

The attack also coincided with Israel’s escalating efforts to seal a landmark peace deal with Saudi Arabia, which has never recognized the Jewish state out of solidarity with the Palestinians, but had seemed ready to change its policy. It was not immediately clear how the normalization effort would be affected. The Saudi government issued a statement of concern about the situation and called for a cessation of hostilities.

Mr. Netanyahu spoke with President Biden by phone on Saturday afternoon, his office said, telling Mr. Biden that “a forceful and continued battle will be required, in which Israel will triumph.” In his own statement, Mr. Biden said that “the United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel” and that “Israel has a right to defend itself and its people.”

The ease with which Palestinian fighters entered Israel prompted recriminations and anger among Israelis. There were questions about the quality of Israeli intelligence gathering, normally a point of Israeli pride, and suggestions that the Israeli military — which has focused its recent activity on quelling an insurgency in the West Bank — had misdirected its energies."

The United Nations said that nearly one million Gazans had fled their homes.

In Israel, the military said Saturday it would continue to expand operations to include “an integrated and coordinated attack from the air, sea and land.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Israeli soldiers readying for attack, and video of the Saturday afternoon encounter showed Mr. Netanyahu asking soldiers, “Are you ready for what comes next?”

Across the border, there were scenes of residents fleeing in cars, in horse-drawn carriages and on foot. Evacuees fleeing the anticipated invasion of northern Gaza struggled to find food, water and shelter in the south. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations agency dedicated to Palestinians, said an electricity blackout and a lack of drinking water had become “a matter of life or death.” Displaced families crammed into schools and hospitals while others crowded into the houses of friends and family.

And as the United States, Egypt and Israel discussed terms for a safe passage of U.S. citizens out of the territory, the vast majority of the more than two million residents in Gaza, nearly half of them under 18, were trapped, some sleeping in cars, on chairs and on the ground, even as Israeli airstrikes continued."

This year, though, it is a day of sorrow for the Argamanis, after their daughter, Noa, now 26, was seen on video being kidnapped Saturday from a music festival by Hamas assailants.

Her parents held Noa’s birthday dinner in their home in Be’er Sheva, in southern Israel, with cake and two empty chairs at the dining table. One was for their daughter, and one was for her boyfriend, Avinatan Or, who was kidnapped with her.

“We are waiting at home to celebrate your birthday,” Ms. Argamani said in a recent interview, hoping her daughter could somehow receive the message. Only a few nights earlier, she had sat at the same table with her daughter and Mr. Or, she said, just before they went to the festival near Re’im in Israel, three miles from the border with Gaza.

Israeli authorities estimate that 260 people at the festival died in the Hamas assault. Hours after the attack began, friends showed Ms. Argamani a video that had surfaced online of her daughter being forcefully taken away on a motorcycle by Hamas attackers.

Their country was under attack, they said. They needed to return. They needed to fight.

“It’s the thought that you have friends that will be in immediate danger, and you cannot help them,” said Yotam Avrahami, 31, one of the many Israelis who has been packing bags and preparing to join the fight.

Mr. Avrahami, who has lived in New York for four years, said he is lucky — his wife and 7-month-old daughter will stay in New York, safe from the violence. But his friends back home have already had loved ones die in the most recent attacks — and they have seen children killed, too.

“You’re trying to protect them,” he said. “It’s as simple as that.”

Mr. Avrahami spent about $2,000 on a one-way plane ticket, he said, and he has planned to report to a base on Sunday to see where he is needed. He has also been messaging another friend who was waiting to fly home from Dubai."
290,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/us/politics/saudi-arabia-israel-palestinians-hamas.html,"But American officials have been unable to make headway on that for decades. So in both the Trump and Biden administrations, a main diplomatic effort in the Middle East has been promoting normalization between Israel and Arab nations, with Palestinian officials and representatives playing no real role in the talks.

The theory for some American and Israeli officials and Arab leaders was that such deals, in the form of the Abraham Accords, would help isolate and suppress the Palestinian issue, which they saw as an intractable problem. Jared Kushner, former President Donald J. Trump’s son-in-law and a White House adviser who helped forge the accords, was a main proponent of that thinking.

To critics, that has been the crux of the problem, and one reason the United States and Israel were blindsided by the Hamas attack on Saturday. The crowds of civilians in Gaza cheering the Hamas fighters underscored the extent of anti-Israel hostility among Palestinians — hostility that American, Israeli and Arab officials have tried to ignore for years as they pushed normalization talks and what the Biden administration has called “regional integration.”

“Prior to the Hamas attack on Israel, there was bipartisan agreement, shared by most of the U.S. foreign policy establishment, that the question of Palestine no longer matters in the Middle East,” said Nader Hashemi, a professor of Middle East politics at Georgetown University. He added that he believed Arab leaders have relayed that same message in private because they dislike how their citizens mobilize around Palestinian issues.

“The masses of Arabs and Muslims had a different view of this equation — but who in D.C. cares about them?” Mr. Hashemi said. “All of the assumptions that informed U.S. policy toward the Middle East have now been upended by recent events. The question of Palestine is now back on the top of the regional agenda and the world agenda. I think this was the goal of the Hamas attack.”"

It was just one interaction on one day in a long campaign. But it could well be a preview of how the divisive issue could play out in the presidential election.

Mr. DeSantis, standing next to a row of coffee dispensers inside Simon’s Market, began his campaign stop by telling a group of voters that he had just issued an executive order to help bring stranded Americans home from Israel.

Laurie Anan, an undecided voter who said she had visited Israel in August, broke in to thank Mr. DeSantis, saying that the images of the bloody attacks by Hamas over the weekend were “devastating.”"

Mr. Trump, Ms. Haley suggested, lacks moral clarity and has not left “the baggage and negativity” of the past behind, an apparent reference to Mr. Trump’s still-simmering animosity toward Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, over events that include his congratulating President Biden on winning the 2020 election. Mr. Ramaswamy, meanwhile, sounds more like a liberal Democrat than a Republican, Ms. Haley said.

“To go and criticize the head of a country who just saw massive bloodshed — no, that’s not what we need in a president,” Ms. Haley said of Mr. Trump, the former president and current Republican front-runner, in a news conference in Concord, N.H., after filing to get on the state’s primary ballot.

Although paling in comparison to the fighting that has taken place around Gaza, in the country’s southwest, the continued clashes on Israel’s northern border have deepened unease over the possibility that the conflict — already the broadest invasion in 50 years — could spread to multiple fronts.

There were signs late Tuesday that could happen: The Israeli Army said it had identified a number of launches from Syria into Israeli territory, the first time that fire had been exchanged across that border since fighting erupted on Saturday. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

The Israeli military said the projectiles apparently fell in an open area and that it had been firing artillery and mortar shells in return.

Along the Israel-Lebanon border, the day had begun with residents assessing the aftermath of clashes Monday, when Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group based in Gaza, sent fighters into Israel, two of whom died. Funeral processions were held in southern Lebanon for three Hezbollah fighters also killed amid the skirmish by Israeli shelling.

But the relative calm was shattered Tuesday evening when 15 rockets were fired over the border from just outside the Lebanese city of Tyre, on the Mediterranean coast, the Israeli military said. Four of the rockets were intercepted, the military said.

Although it was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack, the Israelis said they had responded by striking two Hezbollah observation posts with tank fire. Hezbollah responded in turn with an anti-tank guided missile attack on an Israeli armored personnel carrier in the northern Israeli town of Avivim, according to a statement from Al Manar, the Hezbollah-owned Lebanese broadcaster.

Hezbollah published footage it said was of the attack, which showed two strikes on an idle military vehicle, leaving it with considerable damage. The Israeli Army said no soldiers were injured. It added that Israeli forces had struck another Hezbollah observation post in response.

As the exchange of fire continued late into the night, two senior Lebanese army officials claimed that Israel had used munitions loaded with white phosphorus, the use of which can be a violation of international law when civilian areas are targeted. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.

Footage posted online showed white puffs trailing white smoke before falling to the ground. A spokesperson for the Israeli Army denied the use of white phosphorus, saying soldiers had deployed only illumination flares."

The soldiers, retaking control of the kibbutzim, towns and settlements near the Gaza Strip that came under attack by Palestinian terrorists over the weekend, have recovered body after body after body.

Hamas gunmen, hitting more than 20 sites in southern Israel, killed more than 1,000 people, including women and children, and abducted an estimated 150 more people. Officials from Israel, the United States, Europe and the United Nations have condemned the violence in the starkest terms, with the U.N. secretary general saying, “Nothing can justify these acts of terror and the killing, maiming and abduction of civilians.”

Half of all buildings in northern Gaza are likely damaged or destroyed, according to satellite analysis estimates

An updated analysis of satellite imagery shows that in the month and a half since Israel’s war in Gaza started, about half of all buildings in the northern Gaza Strip have been damaged or destroyed. That proportion is up from roughly one-third of buildings estimated to have been damaged two weeks ago.

The destruction of buildings and other structures in northern Gaza has continued even as the Israeli military has established an increased presence there and continued its advance into Gaza City. Israeli forces have been steadily surrounding hospitals in northern Gaza, including Indonesian Hospital, which was struck early on Monday morning.

Israel says that Hamas, the armed group that rules Gaza and was responsible for the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, has concealed bases inside hospitals, and it has begun releasing videos that it says support its assertion. Hamas has denied Israeli accusations that it uses civilian infrastructure and says Israel is committing war crimes by targeting hospitals.

More than 12,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel’s bombardment of the strip began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Throughout the entire Gaza Strip, including southern Gaza, at least 56,000 buildings appear to be damaged, or an estimated 20 to 26 percent of all buildings, according to the analysis by two researchers, Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University and Corey Scher of the CUNY Graduate Center. The assessment identified individual building footprints that were most likely damaged based on an analysis of satellite imagery collected on Nov. 18.

According to the analysis, at least 13,200 structures have also been damaged in southern Gaza, below the evacuation line that Israel established on Oct. 13 when it ordered all northern Gazans to relocate to the south. In recent days, some residents in and around Khan Younis in southern Gaza have also reported seeing evacuation orders, in the form of fliers addressed to residents of agricultural villages east of the city. Some areas in those villages, including Khuza’a and Bani Suheila, have sustained significant damage.

Residents of southern Gazan villages report receiving evacuation orders

In Khan Younis — the largest city in southern Gaza — some residents reported seeing fliers said to have been dropped by Israeli planes warning people in outlying villages to evacuate.

The fliers, images of which have circulated online for days, were addressed to residents of four agricultural villages north and east of the city, near the border with Israel: Al Qarara, Bani Suheila, Abasan and Khuza’a. The four villages make up a large geographic area in southern Gaza.

The villages are east of Salah al-Din Road, the main north-south artery, which people have been using to flee from the north. The origin of the images was not clear and the Israeli military declined to comment on them.

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said early Saturday that there had been “intense strikes” by the Israelis in the south as well as “ground clashes” between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups. The agency said that clashes took place in Khan Younis and near Rafah in southern Gaza, as well as in the north during the previous 24 hours.

Frequent clashes continue along Israel’s volatile border with Lebanon

Israel’s military and Hezbollah, an armed militant group and ally of Hamas operating in Lebanon, have continued to clash along Israel’s volatile northern border.

The escalating violence has stoked fears that Israel’s war in Gaza, which began after Hamas led sweeping attacks on Israelis on Oct. 7, could widen to another front and potentially draw in Iran, which supports both Hamas and Hezbollah. However, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told the political leader of Hamas in early November that Iran would not enter the war on Hamas’s behalf, according to Reuters.

Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech last week that the group would keep up pressure on Israeli forces and try to strike targets deeper into Israeli territory, but he stopped short of a war declaration.

Mr. Nasrallah previously described Hezbollah’s objective as exchanging fire with a portion of Israel’s military to keep it occupied along multiple fronts, reducing the burden on Hamas.

The border skirmishes have, for the most part, involved Israeli troops and Hezbollah militia members. A few civilians have been killed on either side of the border since Oct. 7, according to reports from Israel’s military and Lebanon’s state news agency, and thousands more have fled their homes in border-area villages.

Where Israeli vehicles are advancing into Gaza City

Israeli forces have continued to advance deep into Gaza City, fighting street battles with Hamas and surrounding battered hospitals, where conditions are increasingly dire. Tracks of Israeli military vehicles, indicating the broad outlines of the advance on the city from the north and the south, are visible in commercially available satellite imagery taken on Nov. 11.

Hundreds of patients and thousands of displaced people have been trapped in Al-Shifa Hospital, the Gaza Strip’s largest, as Israeli tanks and troops battle Hamas fighters nearby. The World Health Organization said on Sunday that the hospital was no longer functioning, as three days “without electricity, without water and with very poor internet” had severely hurt its ability to provide care.

Israeli officials say that Hamas uses hospitals in Gaza as shields for its fighters, and that the Israeli military is targeting an underground Hamas command center beneath the Al-Shifa complex. Hamas and hospital officials have denied the existence of such a command center.

Israeli forces have reached at least three other hospitals in northern Gaza, including Al-Rantisi and Al-Nasr, which have been evacuated, and Al-Quds, which is no longer operational. Fighting near Al-Quds on Monday disrupted efforts to evacuate patients and made it difficult for medical staff to make it in and out.

Violence escalates in the West Bank as confrontations turn increasingly deadly

Violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank has escalated to nearly four times its level before the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, leading to more than 175 deaths, almost all of them Palestinian.

Clashes between Palestinians and Israeli settlers and soldiers have been a longstanding issue. But the war between Israel and Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, has further stoked tensions in the West Bank. The territory is much bigger than Gaza and a more complex Palestinian-majority area, where a growing number of Israeli settlements have also taken root.

Many of the confrontations have broken out either between Palestinian civilians and Israeli soldiers, often after an Israeli-led arrest or raid, or they have broken out after attacks and physical intimidation by Israeli settlers.

Clashes between Palestinian militants and Israeli troops have also escalated, fanning fears that war could break out on a second front.

The confrontations have also become increasingly deadly. A large proportion of the civilian deaths occurred after demonstrations or protests turned violent. These included many instances in which Palestinians threw stones at Israeli forces, who then responded with tear gas, rubber-coated bullets, stun grenades or live ammunition, or a combination of those. A number of deaths also occurred during direct attacks in which Israeli soldiers opened fire on Palestinians.

The data does not include episodes of violence that have occurred since Nov. 3, including Israeli military raids in the city of Jenin on Thursday, where 14 Palestinians were killed, according to Palestinian officials.

The data was compiled by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a crisis monitoring organization, which collected information about political violence in the West Bank by examining reports from governments, social media, and local and national news services.

The map above does not include cases of looting, land seizure or property destruction in which physical violence was not reported. But these sorts of episodes have also increased in frequency since Oct. 7, often targeting herders and Bedouin communities and destroying homes or sources of livelihood, like olive tree groves.

More than 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, including entire herding communities, have been forcibly displaced from their homes since Oct. 7, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which has also been tracking the conflict.

Strikes hit hospitals, schools and other shelters for displaced people in the Gaza Strip

Israeli strikes have continued to batter the Gaza Strip since Israel’s ground invasion began 13 days ago. As the Israeli military has encircled Gaza City and reached deep into the city, air and ground strikes have hit locations throughout the enclave where thousands of displaced people are known to be sheltering, including hospitals and schools.

Attacks with known fatalities on hospitals and schools, Oct. 28 through Nov. 8 The New York Times

At least two strikes since the invasion have hit Al Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest medical complex, where the United Nations has said 60,000 people are sheltering. On Nov. 3, Israel struck near the hospital’s entrance, killing 15 people, according to Gaza’s health ministry and the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Israel has said that Hamas has a command center under the hospital and that the strike targeted an ambulance being used by a terrorist cell.

On Monday, a strike on the top floor at the same hospital killed one child, said Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the head of the hospital. Israel denied responsibility for the Monday attack.

Gaza’s health ministry said a strike on Saturday killed 15 people at Al Fakhura school, where 16,000 people were sheltering. Other strikes in the past 13 days have hit a medical complex that contains Al Rantisi Hospital and Al Nasr Children’s Hospital, which has been sheltering about 16,000 displaced people, as well as Al Quds Hospital, which has been sheltering 14,000.

Reports from Wafa, the state-run news agency of the Palestinian Authority, have additionally mentioned strikes on or in the vicinity of at least three other hospitals and five other schools in the past 13 days.

Many strikes since the invasion have also hit densely populated, developed neighborhoods in Gaza that are designated as refugee camps, which are home to Palestinians and their descendants who fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1940s war that surrounded the creation of Israel.

It is unclear how many people remain in each of Gaza’s refugee camp neighborhoods, particularly in the north, since tens of thousands of residents followed Israel’s orders to evacuate to southern Gaza. What is certain is that many others have been unable to flee safely, and strikes in both the north and the south have resulted in numerous casualties.

Strikes on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 on Jabaliya in the northern Gaza Strip killed at least 195 people and injured hundreds more, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run government media office, and left a 40-foot-wide crater. The Israeli military said that the strike had targeted Hamas militants, including a central figure in the Hamas-led attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Reports from Wafa have also mentioned attacks on the Jabaliya neighborhood on several other days, some with dozens of fatalities. The casualty counts could not immediately be independently confirmed.

Refugee camp neighborhoods in the south, below the evacuation boundary established by Israel, have also been struck, including multiple times in Nuseirat, Bureij and Maghazi. A strike on Maghazi over the weekend killed at least 47 people, Gaza’s health ministry said, with the death toll expected to rise. A spokesperson for the Israeli military said it was looking into reports of the strike.

Overall in Gaza, about 1.5 million people are internally displaced, according to a United Nations estimate.

A third of buildings in northern Gaza are damaged or destroyed, analysis estimates

The vast devastation from Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip continues to worsen. Roughly a third of all buildings in northern Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, an analysis of satellite imagery found — with thousands of buildings showing evidence of new damage just last week.

The Israeli military has continued to pummel the Gaza Strip, and particularly northern Gaza, with strikes even as ground troops have moved toward Gaza City over the past week and a half. Israel said on Monday that it had struck about 450 targets in Gaza in the previous 24 hours. Israel has encircled Gaza City, effectively cutting northern Gaza off from the south.

More than 10,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel’s bombardment of the strip began a month ago, according to the Gaza Health Ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.

Throughout the entire Gaza Strip, including southern Gaza, at least 38,000 buildings appear to be damaged, or an estimated 13 to 18 percent of all buildings, according to the analysis by two researchers, Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University and Corey Scher of the CUNY Graduate Center. The assessment identified individual building footprints that were most likely damaged based on an analysis of satellite imagery ending on Sunday.

The Israeli military on Monday reiterated its demand that residents of northern Gaza move south, and an evacuation corridor was reopened for four hours. United Nations monitors reported about 5,000 people left the north during that window, while others were unable to make the journey. Because of heavy damage to roads, the only option was to flee on foot, according to a report from the United Nations’ humanitarian and emergency relief office.

The damage assessment shows that Israeli forces have continued to strike in southern Gaza, below the evacuation line, though damage there is less concentrated than in the north.

In an interview with ABC News that aired Monday night, Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, indicated that he expected Israel to have an “overall security responsibility” over Gaza for an “indefinite period” once the fighting there is over, though he did not say who he thought should govern the enclave if Hamas is eliminated.

Frequent fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border continues as tensions mount

Intense clashes have escalated for weeks along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, stoking fears of a war between Israel and Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia and political party that is an ally of Hamas.

On Friday, in his first remarks since the start of Israel’s war with Hamas, Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, described the group’s objective as a controlled battle along the border rather than an all-out war. But he also promised an eye for an eye on civilian deaths, raising concerns that the militia’s attacks would expand beyond military targets.

Lebanon’s state news agency said Sunday that four civilians, three of them children, who were traveling in a car in southern Lebanon were killed by an Israeli strike.

Israel and Hezbollah have clashed repeatedly since Oct. 7, the date of Hamas’s surprise attack on Israel. Mr. Nasrallah said that Hezbollah’s aim was to keep Israeli forces tied up along the northern border with Lebanon, reducing the burden on Hamas.

Where Israel’s invasion has cut Gaza in two

Israeli ground forces have reached across the full width of the Gaza Strip, satellite imagery shows, encircling Gaza’s largest city and cutting off the roads running south.

The imagery, taken on Friday morning by Planet Labs, a commercial satellite provider, shows how far Israel has moved into Gaza and the scale of its southern line of attack, where at least five groups of armored vehicles are visible south of Gaza City.

And the imagery confirms statements from Israel’s military on Thursday night that it had surrounded Gaza City from several directions. Armored vehicles can be seen just 300 meters from Al-Rasheed Street, a coastal road that is one of the two main north-south routes in the Gaza Strip.

It is unclear how deep Israeli forces have entered into Gaza City itself. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on social media on Thursday that Israeli forces were already “beyond the outskirts” of the city.

Israel’s recent advances have surrounded Gaza City above ground, but Hamas also relies on a network of tunnels, thought to be hundreds of miles long, to move around the enclave. Israel is targeting the tunnels with airstrikes, but it is hard to know what damage it has caused to the network so far.

The imagery also shows entire dense neighborhoods in northern Gaza that look mostly leveled, reflecting the extraordinary level of devastation from Israeli bombardment over the past several weeks. At least a quarter of all buildings in northern Gaza appear damaged or destroyed as of Sunday, an analysis of satellite imagery found.

In the small neighborhood of Izbat Beit Hanoun, shown below, dozens of craters are visible, and many buildings are completely destroyed.

Where Israeli forces are advancing toward Gaza City

Satellite imagery taken on Wednesday indicates that Israeli ground troops are continuing to close in on Gaza City.

Heavy-vehicle tracks extend deep into the Gaza Strip along three fronts, the satellite image shows: three miles past Gaza’s northern border along the coast, 1.5 miles past the border in the northeast and along a westward stretch south of Gaza City, nearly reaching the coast.

Israeli soldiers have been encroaching from the north, east and northeast in an effort to cut the northern part of the enclave off from the south. Earlier on Thursday, the Israeli military said that it had “completed the encirclement of Gaza City” and had advanced beyond the city’s outskirts.

The military wing of Hamas, Al Qassam Brigades, did not confirm the claim, but said Thursday on Telegram that it had fired on Israeli forces near the Shati area along the coast and near Juhor ad Dik, close to Gaza’s eastern border.

In the six days since Israel began its ground invasion, the Israeli military has continued its intensive aerial bombardment of northern Gaza. Several airstrikes earlier this week, which Israel said had targeted Hamas operatives, hit the densely populated Jabaliya neighborhood, leveling whole blocks.

While only an estimate, the spatial analysis indicates the enormous destructiveness of Israel’s bombing campaign, which has become one of the most intense of the 21st century. Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed more than 8,000 people, according to Gazan health officials.

Between 38,200 and 44,500 buildings throughout the Gaza Strip are estimated to have been damaged or destroyed since the beginning of the war, according to the analysis, by two researchers, Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University and Corey Scher of the CUNY Graduate Center.

The analysis includes damage from the beginning of the war until Sunday, before a strike hit a densely populated residential area in Jabaliya on Tuesday.

Wide swaths of Gaza City and the surrounding area have been damaged, with the greatest damage concentrated north of the city, according to the assessment, which identified individual building footprints that were most likely damaged based on an analysis of satellite imagery. Throughout Gaza, about 14 percent of buildings appear to be damaged or destroyed.

Since Oct. 25, the Israeli military’s aerial bombardment has damaged many homes and residential buildings, as well as commercial buildings, in northern Gaza. Israeli strikes also hit near Al Quds Hospital in Gaza City, where thousands were seeking refuge.

The analysis shows that Israel has continued to strike southern Gaza even as it has renewed warnings for civilians to move there from the north.

Israel’s military appears to be approaching Gaza City from at least three sides. Photos, videos and satellite imagery show lines of armored vehicles advancing from Gaza’s northern border and taking up positions near a major road farther south.

Israel has provided limited details about the invasion, four days into what an Israeli official described as an “extended ground operation.” But imagery verified by The Times indicates large groups of tanks and other armored vehicles making their way deep into Gaza, as Israel’s military has continued to strike nearby buildings from the air.

In northwest Gaza, a satellite image taken on Monday morning by Planet Labs shows large groups of armored vehicles advancing about three miles south of the northern border near the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Groups of vehicles can be seen amassed in open spaces of the densely populated area of Al Karama, north of Gaza City, less than two miles north of the crowded Shati refugee camp. Many nearby buildings appear to have been heavily damaged or completely destroyed by airstrikes.

Photographs also show a second group of armored vehicles near the city of Beit Hanoun, on the northeast edge of the Gaza Strip. Beit Hanoun had already been significantly damaged by airstrikes in the past several weeks.

Farther south, a video taken by Palestinian media worker Youssef Al Saifi on Monday morning, and verified by The Times, showed an Israeli armored vehicle firing on and destroying a car along Salah al-Din, Gaza’s main north-south road. The car was carrying a family, Mr. Al Saifi said. Satellite imagery from around the same time showed groups of Israeli armored vehicles positioned near the road.

Palestinian health officials say more than 8,000 people have been killed in Gaza, many of them children, since Israel began launching retaliatory airstrikes in response to a Hamas attack on Oct. 7.

Where Israeli military videos show ground forces entering Gaza

Few details have emerged of the Israeli military advance into Gaza, where internet connections and phone lines have been almost entirely cut off. But videos released by Israel’s military and geolocated by The Times indicate at least three separate places where Israeli troops have crossed the border into northern Gaza over the past few days.

Israeli military officials said on Saturday that troops remained in northern Gaza on Saturday evening after advancing into it on Friday. This marked a departure from the military’s earlier releases, which had indicated that troops had exited the areas depicted in the videos after conducting strikes.

While basic details of the operation remain shrouded in secrecy, video footage released by Israel’s military on Saturday showed lines of tanks operating on the Gaza side of the northern border, along with clouds of smoke rising from significant explosions.

Farther south, a line of tanks can be seen in footage released by Israel on Friday traveling west toward the village of Juhor ad Dik, southeast of Gaza City.

Buildings, including what appear to be houses and apartment buildings, are seen being bombarded in an area about one mile long in Juhor ad Dik. The village is just north of the evacuation line that Israel established on Oct. 13 when it ordered all northern Gazans to relocate to the south.

Activity shown in an Israeli military video posted Friday Israeli tanks on the ground south of Gaza City, traveling west. Israeli tanks firing from the shore in northern Gaza. Bombing of an apartment building south of Gaza City. Bombardment of buildings in the village of Juhor ad Dik.

The ground advance on Friday was accompanied by a particularly intense round of Israeli bombardment in northern Gaza, as well as a widespread communication blackout that has made it difficult to assess the extent of the military action. So far, the maneuver appears more limited than some experts had predicted.

Hamas’s armed wing confirmed on Friday night and Saturday afternoon that its forces were fighting with Israeli soldiers inside Gaza.

A new look at where Israel has hit Gaza

An analysis of satellite imagery shows the tremendous structural damage that northern Gaza has sustained since Oct. 17, adding to already significant damage from the preceding 11 days. The Israeli military said Wednesday that it had struck more than 7,000 targets inside Gaza.

Photographs taken in Gaza show the enormous range of buildings damaged by strikes in the past week, which include bakeries, a supermarket, a restaurant and many houses and residential buildings. The 19-day bombing campaign has become one of the most intense of the 21st century.

The area around Gaza City has been hit particularly hard. On the morning of Oct. 23, smoke blanketed much of that region. A soft drink manufacturing facility in an eastern area of the city, its roof covered with solar panels, was burning.

Over the past two weeks, Israel has ramped up airstrikes in southern Gaza even after demanding the relocation of hundreds of thousands of residents of northern Gaza to the south. The increase in strikes in the south also coincides with the arrival of aid convoys through the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt. These maps do not capture strikes that did not result in damage to manmade structures.

Deadliest period for Palestinians in the West Bank in 15 years

More Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in the past few weeks than in any similar period in at least the past 15 years, according to Palestinian health authorities and historical data from the United Nations.

Israeli forces and settlers have killed 95 Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank since the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, health officials said, a surge in violence in what was already a particularly deadly year in the West Bank. One Israeli soldier was also killed in clashes.

Sources: U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (historical figures), Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank (figures since Oct. 7).

Most of the Palestinian deaths in the West Bank have been in clashes with Israeli forces, while others were the result of settler attacks.

Masked settlers shot and killed three Palestinians in the village of Qusra on Oct. 11, according to Palestinian health officials. At a funeral procession for the victims the next day, settlers attacked again, killing two more Palestinians, a father and son.

The Israeli military carried out a rare airstrike in the West Bank on a mosque in Jenin on Saturday night, killing two. Israel’s military said it was targeting a “terror compound” beneath the mosque that it said was being used to organize an attack.

A raid by Israeli forces on the Nur Shams refugee camp on Thursday ended in the deaths of 13 Palestinians, including five children, as well as an Israeli soldier. The soldier was the first Israeli to have died in the West Bank since Oct. 7, according to U.N. data.

“We are extremely alarmed by the rapidly deteriorating human rights situation in the occupied West Bank and the increase in unlawful use of lethal force,” said Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the U.N. human rights chief, Volker Türk.

Intensifying clashes on the Israel-Lebanon border

As Israeli forces prepare for a possible ground invasion of Gaza, frequent clashes along Israel’s northern border have amplified fears of a broader conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia backed by Iran.

Israeli authorities said on Sunday that they planned to evacuate 14 additional villages near the Lebanese border. The announcement was an expansion of an earlier evacuation order for communities in the area amid intensifying skirmishes between Hezbollah and Israeli troops.

Hezbollah has increased its attacks aimed at northern Israel in recent days, and Israel has retaliated in southern Lebanon. But it is not possible to attribute all of the reported clashes individually to one side or the other.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Sunday that he did not know whether Hezbollah would join the conflict, but said it would result in “devastating consequences to Hezbollah and the state of Lebanon” if it did.

Naim Qassem, Hezbollah’s deputy chief, said on Saturday that the clashes near the border were keeping Israeli troops tied down in the north instead of leaving them free to deploy against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

First aid trucks move through Rafah crossing as southern Gaza is pummeled by strikes

The first convoy of aid trucks moved through the Rafah crossing on Saturday at Gaza’s southern border with Egypt. The convoy of 20 trucks came after days of intense negotiations.

Satellite imagery from Tuesday showed crowds in Gaza waiting at the gate, aid trucks stuck in Egypt and several craters where U.N. officials said Israeli strikes had damaged the road.

Source: Planet Labs

The convoy of aid, which the World Health Organization warned would “barely begin to address the escalating health needs” in Gaza, comes as conditions have further deteriorated in southern Gaza. With clean drinking water in short supply, many Gazans have resorted to drinking polluted water.

The Israeli military has intensified strikes throughout the region over the past week, despite ordering the entire population of northern Gaza to relocate to the south last Friday.

Israel has hit dozens of targets in the south since Oct. 13, according to The Times’s reporting, news imagery and WAFA, the official news agency of the Palestinian Authority — a rival of Hamas that administers parts of the Israel-occupied West Bank. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said on Thursday that at least 81 Palestinians had been killed in southern Gaza in the previous 24 hours.

Gazan authorities also reported Israeli airstrikes throughout the week in the southern areas of Khan Younis and Rafah, as well as Deir al Balah in central Gaza, which also falls below the evacuation zone. In photos and videos, many children appeared to be among those killed. Gazan authorities have also reported that at least 21 members of the same family died in one Israeli strike.

About one million Gazans have been displaced from their homes since the beginning of the conflict, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, some 367,500 in central and southern Gaza. While the exact number and location of internally displaced people who evacuated from the north is unclear, satellite imagery and photos show that, in at least one instance, tents were erected in the past week in the courtyard of a U.N.-run vocational training center.

How Israel is preparing for an invasion

The Israeli military has outlined plans to launch a ground invasion of Gaza soon, with tens of thousands of soldiers ordered to capture Gaza City and wipe out the top leadership of Hamas. Here’s how Israel is preparing for the invasion.

Israel deployed hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles to two fields north of Gaza, which could be seen in satellite imagery captured earlier this week.

Source: Planet Labs Imagery from Oct. 15

The sites are not a secret: Photographers have been allowed access to the vehicles, which arrived at the site sometime between Oct. 8 and Oct. 14, according to imagery from Planet Labs.

Photographs taken at the same location on Saturday show a range of armored vehicles, including Merkava tanks, armored personnel carriers and militarized bulldozers.

Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times

The military buildup seen in these images is about four miles north of the Erez Crossing, the primary entry point on Gaza’s northern border. The Erez Crossing has remained closed since Israeli forces recaptured it following its seizure by Hamas fighters on Oct. 7.

While an exact accounting of every part of Israel’s buildup is not possible, Israeli tanks have also been seen in other locations. Tanks and armored vehicles were photographed on Oct. 14 at a repair center near Be’eri, about two miles north of the site of the music festival Hamas attacked.

Ahead of the ground invasion, Israel has demanded that the entire population of northern Gaza — some 1.1 million people — evacuate to the southern half of the territory. But many people are unable to move, and on Tuesday Israel said it had intensified its bombing in cities in southern Gaza, leading some Palestinians to consider returning home.

An updated look at where Israel has hit Gaza

An updated analysis of satellite imagery shows areas in Gaza that have been significantly damaged in the first 11 days of Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes.

Northern Gaza has continued to receive the brunt of the attacks in recent days, as airstrikes pummeled large parts of Beit Hanoun and the regions near Rimal and Al Jadidah. Strikes also inflicted more damage on the Shati and Jabaliya refugee camps, both of which were previously hit in the earliest days of the war.

Areas along the Salah Al-Din Road, one of two major routes used by Gazans escaping to the southern part of the territory, were also significantly damaged. Dozens of civilians were killed by strikes as they attempted to flee south, according to the Interior Ministry in Gaza.

On Friday, Israeli officials warned 1.1 million civilians living in northern Gaza to evacuate to the south for their own safety, even as Israeli forces intensified bombings in the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah. Pockets of Abasan al-Kabira and Khuza’a were also damaged, along with parts of the Nuseirat, Bureij and Rafah refugee camps.

The Israeli military has said that its airstrikes have targeted command centers, operatives and hide-outs that belong to Hamas, including “terror targets” in Khan Younis and Rafah.

Living conditions have deteriorated rapidly in southern Gaza as food, clean water and other essential supplies dwindle. On Wednesday, President Biden announced that Egypt would allow 20 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza as a test to see if a more sustained flow can begin.

The analysis does not yet show the damage to the Ahli Arab Hospital campus in Gaza City, where hundreds of people were killed in an explosion on Tuesday evening that Israeli officials and Palestinian fighters each blamed on the other.

The aftermath of the hospital explosion in Gaza

Daylight Wednesday made clear the scale of the explosion at the Ahli Arab Hospital, even as the exact cause remained in dispute. Over the past week, hundreds of families, fleeing airstrikes, had sought refuge on the campus of the hospital. Photos and videos showed the extent of some of the damage.

A small impact crater, caused by the munition that hit the area, was visible close to the parking lot. Damage could be seen on some of the surrounding buildings and structures: roof tiles were blown off a church, an ambulance port and a building. Windows in a building housing a cancer diagnostic center were shattered.

The imagery also showed more than a dozen vehicles in the parking lot that were burned, overturned or otherwise damaged. Parts of the parking lot were charred, and fencing was destroyed.

The hospital was also hit on Oct. 14, which damaged the diagnostic center and injured four staff members. Video and images reviewed by The Times indicate that most of the damage shown here was likely caused by Tuesday’s explosion.

Two hours before the explosion, the courtyard was filled with people singing for peace and children playing, Hosam Naoum, Jerusalem’s Anglican archbishop, told reporters on Wednesday.

A frame from a video taken Wednesday showed some of the personal items left by people who had been sheltering in the courtyard.

Gazan officials have said that hundreds of people were killed in the explosion, but the exact casualty numbers were unclear. Many of those killed were women and children, said Dr. Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for the Health Ministry in Gaza.

Explosion at Gaza hospital kills hundreds, Palestinians say

Hundreds of people were killed by an explosion at a hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday, according to Gazan officials. Palestinian officials said the explosion was caused by an Israeli airstrike, while Israeli officials blamed a rocket launch by militants in Gaza.

The New York Times

As of Wednesday morning local time, the precise death toll was still unclear. Many civilians had been sheltering at the hospital. The Civil Defense in Gaza said medical teams were overwhelmed and unable to respond adequately because the hospital was so badly damaged.

The Israeli Defense Forces said on Tuesday night that its intelligence indicated the Islamic Jihad was responsible for a failed rocket launch. A spokesman for the Islamic Jihad denied the assertion, saying the group’s armed wing was not operating in the area.

This video, verified by The New York Times, is the moment a munition struck the hospital in Gaza City, causing an explosion that the Gazan health ministry said killed hundreds.

Protests arise after deadly hospital blast in Gaza

Anger over the hospital blast in Gaza led to a spate of protests across the Middle East and North Africa on Tuesday night, fueling tensions in a region already rocked by war.

People took to the streets from neighboring Lebanon and Jordan to Morocco. Protests were also reported in Europe, South America and the United States.

Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group that has fought escalating clashes with Israel in recent days, denounced the hospital strike as an Israeli “massacre.” The group called for a “day of rage” on Wednesday against Israel and President Biden’s visit, according to a statement.

The Israeli military and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the blast had resulted from a failed rocket launch by Islamic Jihad, a group allied with Hamas.

Violence along the border between Israel and Lebanon

Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah intensified over the weekend along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, fueling fears of a wider regional conflict. Civilians were killed on both sides of the border.

The New York Times

On Monday, the Israeli military announced it would evacuate all residents who live within two kilometers of the border with Lebanon, strengthening orders from Sunday that civilians must stay close to safe rooms in their homes.

Hezbollah claimed responsibility for a strike that killed at least one Israeli civilian and injured three others on Sunday, saying the attack was in response to the death of a Reuters cameraman, Issam Abdallah, on Friday, as well as two other civilians killed in a separate strike on southern Lebanon on Saturday when their house was hit by shelling.

Prime Minister Najib Mikati of Lebanon blamed Mr. Abdallah’s death on Israel, whose military said it was investigating.

On Sunday, a rocket hit the headquarters for U.N. peacekeeping in southern Lebanon. No injuries were reported.

Outside of Gaza, instability and uncertainty throughout the region

As attention has been focused in and around Gaza, tensions have mounted elsewhere in the region.

Since Oct. 7, the Israeli military and Hezbollah, a Lebanese political party and militant group allied with Hamas, have each carried out multiple attacks along the Israel-Lebanon border. Israel has been seeking to prevent Iran from moving weapons through Syria, and attacks on Syrian airports have been reported. Egypt’s Rafah border crossing remained blocked as of Sunday, preventing Gazans as well as foreign nationals from escaping Gaza.

Casualties in the West Bank have not approached the levels in Gaza. But at least 61 Palestinians have been killed with clashes with the Israeli army and settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since Oct. 7, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.

The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, reported that some of those people were shot and killed by Israeli forces during confrontations or protests, while others were civilians killed in a series of attacks by settlers. Israeli officials have not commented on specific incidents but said they were conducting raids in the West Bank to arrest people linked to Hamas.

Where an explosion killed Gazans trying to evacuate

Hours after Israel ordered civilians to leave northern Gaza and designated a corridor for evacuees, at least one explosion occurred on the route. Videos taken shortly after 5 p.m. on Friday on Salah Al-Din Road show that at least nine people, some of them children, lay motionless, some maimed and bleeding, on the road near four burning cars.

Yusuf Al-Hindi, a medic with the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza who responded to the scene, said he saw about 30 dead bodies.

The health ministry has said at least 70 people were killed while they were attempting to follow Israel’s evacuation edict. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a reservist and spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, said while there was no intentional targeting, he could not categorically deny that the explosion was caused by Israeli fire. The New York Times was not able to determine the cause of the explosion.

An initial look at where Israel has hit Gaza

A new analysis of satellite imagery shows an estimate of the areas in Gaza that were significantly damaged in the first six days of Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes. The Israeli Air Force said it dropped about 6,000 bombs throughout Gaza over that time.

Northern Gaza bore the brunt of the damage from the attacks, according to the analysis by satellite remote sensing scientists. Many buildings in the Rimal neighborhood were leveled by Israeli airstrikes, along with large sections of Beit Hanoun. Pockets of the Shati and Jabaliya refugee camps, where dozens were killed, also sustained damage.

Israel has said that its airstrikes have targeted centers of operations of Hamas, and that these can include mosques, houses and office buildings. Aid groups say that many innocent civilians have also been killed or injured.

Early Friday morning, the Israeli military called for the entire population of densely populated northern Gaza to evacuate to the southern half of the territory within 24 hours, in what appeared to be another step in readying for a ground invasion. The maps above show estimates of damage through Thursday evening, before the call for mass evacuation.

Over the past week, about 2,228 people have been killed in Gaza, with 8,744 more injured, according to Palestinian officials.

The scale of destruction in Gaza

Israeli forces bombarded the Gaza Strip with an extraordinary number of airstrikes in recent days, a campaign both deadlier and more widespread than in recent conflicts. Some 6,000 bombs have been dropped since Oct. 7, the Israeli Air Force said.

While a full accounting of the airstrikes is currently impossible, a partial record shows the wide range of the damage. The Times compiled the attacks from verified imagery, tallies from Palestinian and U.N. aid groups and statements from Israeli military officials.

Israel has said its retaliatory strikes, in response to terror attacks on Oct. 7, are focused on targets belonging to Hamas and that these can include mosques, houses and office buildings. Aid groups say many innocent civilians are also being killed or injured.

The Israeli Air Force has said the airstrikes have killed “hundreds of terrorists.” While it is impossible to verify that claim, at least seven of the houses that were destroyed belonged to leaders of Hamas, according to an analysis of on-the-ground reports from the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, an independent organization based in Gaza.

Overall, more than 1,500 Gazans have been killed in the current conflict, according to the Gazan Ministry of Health.

Israel demands that northern Gaza evacuate

Israel’s military issued a statement early Friday warning the entire population of northern Gaza to relocate to the southern half of the territory within 24 hours.

The statement named the marker dividing the north from south as Wadi Gaza, a strip of wetlands that curves across the Gaza Strip.

The U.N. warned that relocating over one million people would lead to “devastating humanitarian consequences.” A U.N. spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, said it has “strongly appealed” for the order to be rescinded to avoid making “what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation.”

Palestinian death toll so far greatly exceeds those of recent conflicts

Far more Palestinians have been killed after six days of Israeli airstrikes than in the first days of recent rounds of fighting, indicating the enormous scale of the Israeli assault on the Gaza Strip.

Sources: Palestinian Ministry of Health; Gazan Health Ministry (2023 deaths) Note: Shows casualties in past clashes that lasted at least a week.

The Gazan Health Ministry said Thursday that 1,417 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes. Those retaliatory strikes have come after attacks by Hamas in southern Israel killed more than 1,200 people, the deadliest assault in the country in more than half a century. It was not immediately clear how many of those killed in Gaza may have been militants.

A U.N. official warned Gaza is “facing a huge disaster” as Israel has cut off water and electricity supplies to the territory and continues to pummel the 140-square-mile strip with strikes.

Over the past 15 years, far more Palestinians have been killed than Israelis in confrontations between the two. In 2014, most of the more than 2,000 Palestinians killed in a 50-day war with Israel were civilians, according to data from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The war also ended in the deaths of 73 Israelis.

Israel plugs border with Gaza and readies possible ground invasion

On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had regained control of the region right outside Gaza and designated it a closed military zone.

Source: Israeli Defense Forces The New York Times

Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a reservist in the Israel Defense Forces, said Israeli troops had plugged the holes in the barrier along the border that had been breached Saturday when Hamas terrorists crossed into Israel. “We are guarding it closely and making sure Hamas terrorists are not infiltrating again,” Mr. Conricus said.

About 300,000 soldiers are assembling near the Gaza Strip for what could be a major ground invasion of the territory. Mr. Cornicus said their mission was to make sure that Hamas “at the end of this war won’t have any military capabilities by which they can threaten or kill Israeli civilians.”

Gaza is tiny, crowded and hard to escape

The Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated areas of the world. More than two million people live inside the sliver of land, just 25 miles long and 7.5 miles at its widest. The confined quarters make it nearly impossible to avoid civilian casualties when airstrikes are launched against the region.

Sources: OpenStreetMap; United Nations By The New York Times

On Tuesday, the Israeli military said its strikes against the coastal territory would be “bigger than before and more severe” because of the scale of the incursion by Hamas, which began Saturday. Israel has struck more than a thousand targets in Gaza so far, leveling apartment buildings, mosques and a marketplace.

At least 200,000 residents of Gaza have been displaced from their homes, according to the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and the scale of the humanitarian disaster is expected to get worse.

Since Hamas seized control of the area in 2007, the Gaza Strip has been under a blockade that restricts the import of goods that could be used to make weapons and prevents most people from leaving.

Israel’s defense minister intensified these restrictions on Monday, cutting off flows of electricity, food, water and fuel into the area.

The Israeli military said it struck more than 500 targets in Gaza from Sunday night and into Monday.

At least four of the destroyed mosques were in the Shati refugee camp, one of the most densely populated areas of the already densely populated Gaza strip. The Israel military has said that Hamas operates out of civilian targets, including one of the mosques it struck today.

Fighting for control of communities near Gaza

Israeli soldiers were still fighting militants in at least six locations in southern Israel near the border with Gaza on Monday morning local time. An Israeli military spokesman said it had regained control of all the communities around 11:30 a.m., but there were still clashes on the ground after the announcement.

Lt. Col. Richard Hecht of the Israel Defense Forces said that not all of the breaches in the border fence had been fully closed, and more militants could still be crossing into Israeli territory from Gaza.

“We are still fighting,” he said at a briefing on Monday morning. “We thought by this morning we’d be in a better place.”

Deadliest day of attacks on Israel in country’s history

More people died in Israel in a single day than any other day since Israel became a state, according to Israel’s foreign press office. Around 700 Israelis had died since attacks began on Saturday, according to Israel’s foreign ministry as of 10:20 p.m. local time on Sunday. The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 413 Palestinians had been killed.

Both sides are continuing attacks, and if Israel uses the same playbook it has in recent conflicts and clashes last more than a few days, the Palestinian death toll will be disproportionate. In recent confrontations, far more Palestinians have been killed by Israelis than Israelis have been killed by Palestinians.

The U.N. reported that 11 Israelis were killed in 2021, the year of the most recent conflict that lasted longer than a week. That conflict began after the Israeli police raided the Aqsa compound in Jerusalem, prompting rocket fire from Gaza. Israel retaliated with airstrikes on Gaza, leading to 349 Palestinian casualties in 2021, including several dozen children.

The U.N. includes in its database Palestinians and Israelis who were killed or injured in conflicts since 2008 in either Israel or the Palestinian territories, which include the West Bank. Information on casualties is collected and entered by field staff and validated by multiple sources.

Israel evacuates civilians from towns bordering Gaza

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Israel’s top military spokesman, said the Israel Defense Forces were evacuating all civilians from the 24 villages near the Gaza border. The move is an indication that Israel might be preparing for an operation inside the Palestinian coastal territory.

The civilian evacuation “will be completed today,” Admiral Hagari said.

A surprise attack by Hamas and Israel’s response

Israel and Hamas declared they were at war on Saturday after Hamas militants launched one of the largest assaults on Israel in 50 years.

Hamas fired thousands of rockets toward Israeli cities, and Palestinian militants crossed into southern Israel, killing civilians and holding Israelis hostage.

Israel retaliated with major strikes across the blockaded Gaza Strip, leveling multistory buildings, including a residential building with approximately 100 units.

At least 2,200 rockets were fired into Israeli airspace in the early hours of the assault, said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Israel’s top military spokesman. Israel’s emergency service, Magen David Adom, said it had received reports of Hamas rockets landing as far north as Tel Aviv. The exact location of many rocket strikes is unknown.

But the official, who requested anonymity to discuss diplomatic and military planning, said Iran had long been deeply connected to Hamas, offering it financial support and military equipment.

Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program on Sunday morning that the Israeli government had “asked for some specific additional assistance” as the country gears up for what Mr. Netanyahu has warned will be a prolonged conflict.

Mr. Austin said the Biden administration would supply the Israeli armed forces with additional equipment and resources, including munitions. U.S. officials declined to be more specific about particular weapons systems, but independent analysts said Israel would likely request more interceptors for its Iron Dome missile defense system as well as bombs and missiles for attack planes.

American officials said on Sunday that they were also working through plans to evacuate thousands of Americans from Israel if necessary in what is called a “noncombatant evacuation.” Pentagon officials emphasized that no decisions have been made but that they were working through options, including one that involves putting some Americans on the Navy ships to get them to safety.

The United States already provides Israel more than $3 billion in military assistance every year, and Mr. Blinken said that much of the equipment from that funding is already “in the pipeline” to be sent to Israel. The Pentagon also has positioned stockpiles of arms and ammunition worth about $2 billion at about six sites throughout Israel. The stockpiles provide weapons and ammunition for the Pentagon to use in Middle East conflicts, and the United States has also allowed Israel access to the supplies in emergencies."

Hamas, the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip, launched a series of rocket strikes that hit major cities across Israel, and it sent waves of fighters across the border into southern Israel, where they took over bases and seized hostages.

Here’s a timeline of what happened on Saturday and into Sunday in Israel and Gaza (times are local):

Last weekend’s attack on Israel by Hamas has brought renewed scrutiny of the armed Palestinian group’s longstanding relationship with Iran, and questions about whether the Gaza-based group could have pulled off such a sophisticated and devastating operation on its own.

Iran has a long history of training and arming proxy militia groups in the region, from Gaza to Lebanon, Iraq and Syria. It supports Hamas militarily and has helped it design and produce a domestic missile and rocket system to match the capabilities and material available in Gaza — an impoverished, densely populated coastal strip that has been blockaded by Israel and Egypt for the past 16 years.

And over the past year, there have been signs that Iran and its proxies were preparing to take a more aggressive approach toward Israel.

Gen. Esmail Ghaani, who is in charge of supervising Iran’s network of proxy militias as head of the country’s paramilitary Quds Force, repeatedly traveled to Lebanon for covert sessions with leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, a Shiite Lebanese militia that Iran also supports."

Health officials in Gaza, home to two million people, said the Israeli bombardment had killed more than 1,500 people and injured over 6,600 others.

Israel’s military says that it is hitting places used by Hamas, which controls Gaza, including mosques, houses and other outwardly civilian locations. Gazans say the airstrikes are doing indiscriminate damage to civilians and civilian sites, and independent observers have confirmed that schools and ambulances have been destroyed.

The retaliatory strikes began after Hamas terrorists broke through the border fence with Israel on Saturday morning and attacked towns, kibbutzim and a military base, killing more than 1,200 people, most of them civilians, wounding about 3,000 others and kidnapping about 150 hostages, the Israeli government said."

The Israeli military reported fighting in seven border communities and an army base, and tanks were seen crossing farmland in parts of southern Israel, heading south toward Gaza. Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, continued to fire rockets into Israel.

But rather than finding safety from a feared ground invasion, at least 70 people were killed along the way when Israeli airstrikes hit some of the vehicles fleeing south, according to the Gazan authorities.

Some Gaza residents said they feared this could be the start of another permanent mass displacement like the one in 1948, when more than 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in present-day Israel during the war surrounding the nation’s establishment. But it was too soon to tell.

“As I’m packing my things, I’m wondering: Is this really another nakba?” said Dr. Arwa el-Rayes, a 56-year-old doctor, speaking in the last moments before she left her childhood home in Gaza City in the north. The nakba, which means catastrophe, is how Palestinians refer to the 1948 displacement."

A growing number of Republicans are resisting continued aid for Ukraine and suggesting that any additional assistance would have to come with major Democratic concessions, including more restrictive immigration laws.

There are also questions about whether the House is even able to act. It has been rudderless with no permanent speaker after Republicans ousted Representative Kevin McCarthy from the post last week. G.O.P. lawmakers are set to meet on Wednesday to select a new nominee for speaker, but they are deeply fractured, which could prolong the process.

In the interim, the House is under the control of Representative Patrick T. McHenry, the North Carolina Republican who was named temporary speaker after Mr. McCarthy’s removal. Many House aides believe Mr. McHenry has only limited governing powers that do not include the right to take major legislative action. But there is no precedent for the current situation, and according to some congressional experts, an acting speaker could do whatever a majority of the House agreed to allow him to do.

“The House as a legislative body is not powerless. It can come into session and consider legislation,” said Sarah Binder, a congressional expert and professor of political science at George Washington University. “At the end of the day, it’s a matter of interpretation.”

Leading members of both parties have used the war between Israel and Hamas to slam the far-right Republicans who voted along with all Democrats to remove Mr. McCarthy from the speakership.

Hours later on Monday morning, Israel’s chief military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, declared that Israeli forces had regained control of the communities along the Gaza border even as he acknowledged that there were still “pockets” of fighting.

Mr. Conricus, a reservist in the Israel Defense Forces, has been actively updating Israelis about the war and the IDF account has been reposting information from him. In one video statement on Sunday that the IDF reposted, he claimed that the military had sent at least 100,000 reservists to the southern border and he appeared to suggest they were preparing for a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip.

Kirby, a White House spokesman, said it was not clear precisely how many were hostages but estimated that the number was “very small, very small, less than a handful.”

The fate of the Americans held by Hamas has been a central preoccupation of U.S. officials since the surprise attack on Saturday, reinforcing that the crisis in Israel is an American crisis as well. While the White House has not ruled out U.S. action to rescue captives if an opportunity presented itself, it has largely deferred to Israel in public, saying that it has sent hostage specialists to help with any efforts to save the hostages.

Senior U.S. officials have backed Israel, though the Israeli military has yet to show incontrovertible proof of a vast Hamas tunnel network. Hamas and hospital officials had denied the accusations.

Almost two days after Israel began its raid of Al-Shifa, New York Times journalists were taken on a controlled tour of the complex by Israeli military officials, and saw a shaft on the hospital grounds.

He raced home, put on his uniform and grabbed his weapon, a nine-millimeter pistol.

About 33 children are among them, according to the Israeli government.

Natural gas fields off the Israeli coast now account for about 70 percent of the country’s electric power generation, reducing the use of polluting coal. The gas has also helped Israel ease what had been a heavy dependence on energy imports.

Speaking to reporters in Tel Aviv, Mr. Netanyahu said that Israel would not agree to a halt in attacks because, he argued, it would strengthen Hamas, the group that controls Gaza and led the attacks earlier this month.

“Just as the United States would not agree to a cease-fire after the bombing of Pearl Harbor or after the terrorist attack of 9/11, Israel will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas after the horrific attacks of Oct. 7,” Mr. Netanyahu said, adding that “calls for a cease-fire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism.”

He then dismissed accusations that Israel is collectively punishing more than two million Gazans for the crimes of Hamas. Israel has cut off electricity, fuel and most food and water supplies to Gaza, and its airstrikes have killed more than 3,000 children, according to the Gazan health ministry.

On Sunday, António Guterres, the U.N. secretary general, said the number of civilians killed in Gaza was “totally unacceptable” and that “all parties must respect their obligations under international humanitarian law.”

But Mr. Netanyahu said Israel was doing what it could to save civilian lives. He cited Israel’s warning civilians to move to southern Gaza, where there are fewer Israeli strikes.

“We’re going out of our way to prevent civilian casualties,” Mr. Netanyahu said."

Among the dead are 33 children, according to an update on Sunday from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which has been tracking the conflicts.

Confrontations in the West Bank have been a longstanding issue, but the violence has intensified over the last three weeks, more than doubling to seven incidents a day, on average, compared with three incidents a day since the start of 2023, according to the U.N.

“We’ve observed more incidents where armed settlers have threatened Palestinians,” Andrea De Domenico, the head of the U.N. humanitarian affairs office, told The New York Times. “In several areas, Palestinians have been ordered to leave under the threat of firearms.”

An ever-growing number of Israeli communities have taken root in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967. The settlements cut into land Palestinians have title to and also undermine the territory needed for any two-state solution, fanning tensions in the region. They also draw many residents who consider the West Bank to be Jewish by birthright.

In the clashes since Oct. 7, almost half have involved “Israeli forces accompanying or actively supporting Israeli settlers while carrying out the attacks,” according to the U.N. report.

The Israeli military declined to comment."

Since Israel’s ground invasion began, Yousur Al-Hlou, a Times video journalist, has been in touch with residents of Gaza City. Even with the blackout lifted, communication remains difficult. Al-Hlou shares what she has heard from those she has been able to reach, often via WhatsApp voice messages.

324,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/opinion/oslo-accords-history.html,"A few days after Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated on Nov. 4, 1995, I remember an Israeli acquaintance telling me that however terrible the circumstances of his death, it had established Mr. Rabin as a martyr for peace. As a result, the Oslo peace process he had begun, named after the city where it was secretly hatched, had become irreversible.

It certainly seemed that way at the time. I had just arrived as a correspondent in Israel, and an aura of hope still hung over the pair of agreements, signed in 1993 and 1995, which granted the Palestinians a degree of self-government and, more important, started a peace process meant to reach a permanent settlement within five years. The handshake on the White House lawn in 1993 between Mr. Rabin, a gruff, chain-smoking warrior-politician who had led Israel in great military victories, and his archenemy, Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization who had dedicated much of his previous life to “uprooting the Zionist entity from our land,” had become something of an icon for how even the most intractable conflict could be resolved.

My interlocutor’s prophecy soon proved tragically wrong. Seven months after Mr. Rabin’s death, after a spate of Palestinian suicide bombings and a controversial Israeli military operation in southern Lebanon, a 46-year-old critic of the Oslo Accords named Benjamin Netanyahu won the first of his many political victories. In fits and starts, the Oslo process ground to a halt, and the Israeli peace camp that had championed it disintegrated.

Now, in view of the terrible carnage in Israel and Gaza, that handshake 30 years ago seems almost a sad footnote in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But I believe the hopes briefly raised by those agreements still hold relevance.

The wisdom of Oslo is a credit to the negotiators, who came to recognize the validity of each other’s guiding narratives: of Israel’s return to a promised land after an unspeakable tragedy and of the Palestinians’ dispossession and humiliating occupation. These narratives could not necessarily be reconciled, but the negotiators were able to escape the zero-sum feuding over who was in the right and acknowledge the other’s yearnings, history and grievances.

Uri Savir, a principal Israeli negotiator during Oslo, described his initial exchange with the chief Palestinian negotiator, Ahmed Qurei, in his book “The Process.” “I believe we’ve arrived at the root of the problem,” he recalled Mr. Qurei, better known as Abu Ala, saying. “We have learned that our rejection of you will not bring us freedom. You can see that your control of us will not bring you security. We must live side by side in peace, equality and cooperation.” Mr. Savir and Mr. Qurei emerged close friends from the negotiations. (Mr. Savir died last year, Mr. Qurei in February.)

Oslo was never meant as a final settlement; it did not even make mention of a Palestinian state. It was intended to begin a process in which both sides would gather the confidence and trust to tackle the real obstacles to a settlement: the Palestinians’ claim to a right to return to homes from which they were driven in 1948; how to share Jerusalem, which both claimed as their sacred capital; and what to do about the Jewish settlements multiplying on occupied Palestinian lands.

In retrospect, the absence of an agreement on the ultimate goal — Palestinian statehood, or what is now known as the two-state solution — may have been a fatal error. Mr. Arafat was assailed by a broad array of Palestinians, from Islamist groups to intellectuals, for making major concessions in exchange for a vague prospect. Extremist groups reverted to suicide bombings, which Mr. Arafat failed to stop, to undermine the agreements.

In the 1996 electoral campaign after Mr. Rabin’s death, Mr. Netanyahu attacked Shimon Peres, Mr. Rabin’s partner and often guide in the Oslo negotiations, for “subcontracting” Israeli security to the Palestinians. Jewish settlements in occupied territories continued to expand, and the peace process was further undermined by provocative Israeli actions such as Ariel Sharon’s visit to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem in 2000, which contributed to the Palestinian uprising known as the second intifada.

By 2002, Mr. Arafat was isolated in his headquarters in Ramallah, surrounded by Israeli forces; two years later he was dead of a sudden ailment that has never been conclusively explained, leaving the Palestinian Authority in the hands of Mahmoud Abbas, an aging and ineffective leader who lost control over Gaza in 2007 to Hamas. That prompted an Israeli and Egyptian blockade of the densely populated enclave, leaving its 2.1 million residents, the majority of them refugees or descendants of refugees driven from their homes after the creation of Israel in 1948, in ever worsening conditions.

The question now is whether the terrifying new eruption of death and destruction in Gaza will harden hatreds on both sides or whether it will eventually lead Israelis and Palestinians back to the realization of Oslo, that occupation and rejection cannot lead to peace. The battle is still unfolding, and the severity of the carnage and destruction will shape much of what follows. If Hamas is driven from power, the Israeli objective, the question is whether the Palestinian Authority would be capable of filling the vacuum, and if not, who then? Much depends also on whether West Bank Palestinians or Hezbollah in Lebanon are sucked into the fray or remain on the sidelines, responding to pressure from the United States and others. Much will depend, too, on the intensive soul searching that is inevitable in Israel when the guns fall silent and whether the Israeli public will allow Mr. Netanyahu and the religious-nationalist extremists in his cabinet to stay in office.

However it plays out, the root of the problem identified by the Palestinians and Israelis in what is still the closest they have come to an accommodation remains the same: The Palestinians will gain freedom only when Israelis find acceptance and security, and Israelis will achieve that bitahon, the broad Hebrew term for security that so pervades Israel’s consciousness, only when the Palestinians have sovereignty over their lives."
325,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/world/middleeast/gaza-civilian-interviews.html,"From the explosions outside, Mr. Hamda could not really judge whether the Israelis really were close by. In his apartment, it all sounded the same: boom after boom, scaring the kids, whether from airstrikes, artillery fire or something else.

Their nerves torn to pieces by the most intense night yet of Israeli bombardment, their information limited by lack of electricity and reliable internet, Mr. Hamda and many others in Gaza City had only this to conclude: The Israelis were there, and they, the civilians, had no good choices.

“You either leave or die,” Mr. Hamda said. “These are the options.”

He added: “I’m very scared for my children. I don’t want them to go through this.”

Israel has warned for weeks that civilians in northern Gaza, including those in Gaza City, should evacuate south to avoid the violence.

Many did, only to return home after Israeli bombs pounded the neighborhoods where they were sheltering in the south. Others never left, unable to afford the increasingly expensive taxi ride south or, like Mr. Hamda, convinced things were no safer in the south.

“If they invade on the ground, we will die at home,” Bilal Assabti, a 30-year-old unemployed father of two young children, said by phone on Monday evening. “We do not have anyone in the south. Where should we go?”

That grim determination held for some in Gaza City on Monday, even as they heard that Israeli forces were advancing nearby. After all, some pointed out, Salah Al-Din Road, where the video appeared to show Israeli forces firing on a civilian car, was the main escape route south.

In the video, the car can be seen heading north when it nears an Israeli military position. It is hit as it is turning around, the blast appearing to shove it off the road.

The car of the person filming immediately makes a U-turn. “Go back! Go back!” someone shouts when it passes another vehicle on the road.

The New York Times has verified that the video was filmed this morning south of Gaza City on Salah Al-Din Road. The Times has also identified multiple armored vehicles at an Israeli military position at the location of the incident.

Youssef Al Saifi, 28, who filmed the video, said in an interview that he had also seen the Israeli forces firing on a bus.

Asked about the video, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said that he would not detail the location of Israeli forces.

After his brother told him about the tanks on Salah Al-Din Road, Jamal Azzam, a nurse at the Turkish Palestinian Friendship Hospital south of Gaza City, left the hospital for his home in the city. “The north of Gaza is cut off from the south of Gaza now,” he said. “Who can return to the hospital now?”

Mr. Assabti has ruled out leaving, even if the invasion draws close. Unable to pay rent elsewhere or to find a relative or friend to stay with in the south, he has run out of all options, he said.

At home, his family can use the bathroom without having to line up and can sleep in a bed with enough blankets. They can get water from a nearby water desalination plant that runs on solar panels, though they are subsisting only on stocks of canned food.

“We’ve already lived through 30 years of suffering,” he said, sounding worn down. “One would rather die with his family.”

Another Gaza City resident, an Al Jazeera correspondent named Youmna ElSayed, told the network in a live call on Monday that her husband had received a call from the Israeli military telling them to evacuate south “because it’s going to be very dangerous in the area where you are.”

When her husband told the caller that they had heard of Israeli tanks in the main road that could take them south, Ms. ElSayed said, the caller said that he could not tell them which streets to take, and that they should find out for themselves.

“They call us directly and they warn us, telling us to leave and evacuate now, but the bombardments are relentless,” Ms. ElSayed told Al Jazeera.

Every minute, as she spoke, she was interrupted by thunderous blasts.

326,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/briefing/gaza-tunnels.html,"There is a transportation network below Gaza, one that Israel is trying to destroy.

The network is made up of tunnels, where most Hamas fighters are likely living alongside stockpiles of weapons, food, water and, now, more than 200 Israeli hostages. Parts of the tunnels are large enough for vehicles to drive in them.

The Israeli military first launched an intense air attack targeting these tunnels and has now sent in ground troops to destroy them. Eliminating the tunnels would go long way toward breaking Hamas’s control over Gaza.

In today’s newsletter, we’ll explain why the tunnel network is so important — and why Israel will not have an easy time dismantling it.

‘The metro’

Tunnels have existed under Gaza for years. But after Israel withdrew its forces and settlers from Gaza nearly two decades ago, Hamas vastly expanded the underground network. Hamas has a long history of terrorist violence — both the U.S. and the European Union consider it a terrorist group — and the tunnels allow its members to hide from Israeli air attacks."

Ruthi Louk, Ms. Louk’s aunt, said on Israeli radio on Monday that a fragment from Ms. Louk’s skull was gathered at the rave site by workers from ZAKA, a relief organization that retrieved forensic evidence after Hamas’s attacks. Israel’s foreign ministry confirmed her death on Monday in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Shortly after Oct. 7, Hamas released a video of a woman lying face down and mostly naked in the back of a pickup truck in Gaza. Ms. Louk’s mother said she believed it was her daughter because the person had Ms. Louk’s signature dreadlocks and tattoos. The New York Times did not independently verify the video.

The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said the National Institute of Forensic Medicine had identified the bone as being from the base of Ms. Louk’s skull and had said the fragment indicated an injury that was not something Ms. Louk could have survived. The institute would not comment to The Times.

“It is assumed she was dragged onto that pickup truck after she was already dead,” her aunt said on Israeli radio. She added that the family believed Ms. Louk was fatally shot in the head.

“Maybe there can be comfort by the thought she died fast and the abuse to her body was perhaps done when she was already gone,” she said.

The New York Times was not able to immediately reach Ms. Louk’s family for comment.

“The news of Shani Louk’s death is terrible,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote on X on Monday afternoon. “Like many others, she was brutally murdered. This shows the full barbarity behind the Hamas attack — who must be held accountable. This is terror, and Israel has the right to defend itself.”

Ms. Louk’s sister, Adi Louk, posted a picture of her in an Instagram story on Monday.

“With immense sorrow we announce the death of my sister Shani Nicole Louk,” she wrote.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

So on Friday, Israel began its ground war in Gaza. They cut all cellular communications for 34 hours, creating chaos not just for Hamas but for the vast majority of the more than two million Palestinians who live in Gaza. I found this line in the “New York Times” pretty tough. Quote, “They had no way to know whether their loved ones were alive or dead. Emergency phone lines stopped ringing. Desperate paramedics tried to save people by driving toward the sound of explosions. Wounded people were left to die in the street.” Imagine hearing or seeing an explosion not far from you and not being able to call your relatives who live there.

Palestinian health officials say that more than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed since Oct. 7. And I want to note here that there is a fog of war. It is possible these numbers are wrong. It is also, of course, possible that, particularly by the end of this, these numbers will be much higher. But if you take something like the 8,000 number as right, well, then one way the horror of Oct. 7 was driven home, one way its scale was driven home to Americans was to put it in terms of 9/11s. Adjusting for population, Joe Biden said it was like 15 9/11s. If you take that same math, then Gaza’s experience so far around 400 9/11s. What does that do to a population?

Something on my mind right now, for obvious reasons, is protests against Israel have broken out all over the world. Anti-Semitism is surging across the Chinese internet, as state-run media there blames the United States for, quote, “blindly backing Israel.” In Dagestan, a majority Muslim republic in Southern Russia, dozens were arrested after storming an airport hunting for people who had arrived on a flight from Tel Aviv. At Cornell University, the Jewish Center was under guard after threats of violence. A few blocks away from me, the synagogue I take my children to on weekends was spray painted. I took my kids to the park over the weekend and was rerouted because the streets were closed for anti-Israel protests. My kids kept excitedly running to the window of our home to watch lines of police marching past to keep order.

And I’m not convinced this will make Israel safer. I fear it’ll be just the opposite. I don’t believe the punishment being meted out on ordinary Gazans is moral or is justified. But I also recognize criticism is easy, and I don’t live in Israel or in Gaza. And so there’s been this void, I think, at the heart of a lot of coverage, mine included. What should Israel have done? What should they do? If not this, then what?

Zack Beauchamp is a senior correspondent at Vox, and he’s covered Israel extensively in recent years. And so he set out to answer that exact question. And he spoke with counterterrorism experts and military historians and experts on Hamas. And I found his piece, “What Israel Should Do Now,” one of the best I’ve read since Oct. 7, one of the ones most clarifying. And so I asked him to join me on the show.

And I should note, because things are changing so quickly, that Zack and I spoke on Thursday, Oct. 26. And a lot has happened since then, but nothing, I think, that changes the analysis here. As always, my email ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Zack Beauchamp, welcome to the show.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Hey, Ezra. It’s good to be here with you.

EZRA KLEIN: So I wanted to start with something you wrote, which is that “Two things are true. Israel must do something, and what it’s doing now is indefensible.” And I want to take them in turn. So first, why must Israel do something?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: I spent a lot of time thinking about this question because it seems like the big demand from a lot of people who are critics of Israel is just you should have a cease-fire. They should stop doing what they’re currently doing. I heard this from Palestinians I spoke with.

The problem with that, from the Israeli point of view, is that the massacre of Oct. 7 represented not just a breach of security but a signal collapse in the state’s capacity to provide for the security of the Israeli people. They can’t live in a world where they think this kind of thing would happen again or might happen again.

I think about a conversation I had with Stav Shaffir, who is a former member of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, from the Labor Party, which was a longtime stalwart of the Israeli left. She’s a peacenik, right? Her view for a long time has been two states. Her politics are very focused on inequality inside Israel. Real not like of the far left, but a left-wing Israeli person.

When I spoke to Stav, the palpable pain and fear in her voice, and anger and the understanding of what Hamas was after this attack as being a monstrous, intolerable threat to Israel. She told me, we need to destroy Hamas. No qualifiers. She was like, we can’t live next to them anymore.

And when you hear that kind of thing from somebody who is so affiliated with the left side of the Israeli political spectrum, it gives you a real insight into the way in which Israelis of all stripes have unified around a need to do something — something really, really dramatic about the Hamas threat. This can never be tolerated again from their point of view.

I mean, it speaks to the heart of what Israel is as a country in their mind. From their point of view, Israel exists because Jews were insecure elsewhere. Jews needed their own country with a strong army to be able to protect themselves from this kind of massacre. And if civilians can be killed in such horrific ways, the state has failed. And it needs to do something to show that it hasn’t been a failure.

And an expert on Israeli politics told me this point blank. No cease-fire and no return to the status quo. Something needs to change. What that is, that’s less clear. But what we do know is that needs to be pretty dramatic.

EZRA KLEIN: Let’s hold for a second on the question of a cease-fire, because as you say, that’s become a demand. It is not going to happen at the moment.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: No.

EZRA KLEIN: To some degree, I almost think the meta conversation of a cease-fire is whether you are allowed to call for one in American politics without being sidelined. But would one be a good idea?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: I think a temporary cease-fire for the provision of humanitarian aid is very defensible. The situation in Gaza is absolutely dire on humanitarian terms, and something needs to be done to deal with the spread of infectious disease, the lack of water. I mean, it’s truly horrifying. At the same time, though, Israel hasn’t done enough to deal with the problem that Hamas creates.

EZRA KLEIN: So then let me take the other half of your formulation. What is it doing now? And why do you call what it’s doing now, which is the beginning of what it’s doing, indefensible?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: So I think there’s one really obviously indefensible component, which is the cut-off of electricity, fuel and water supplies to Gaza. This amounts to collective punishment of civilians. I mean, there’s really no definition of the morality of war under which one can say you can do that to people.

And if you look at any dispatch from the ground in Gaza, and you look and you engage with the human toll and the suffering going on, you really understand that what Israel is doing is hurting — really, really hurting innocent people, children even, for no good reason. There are a lot of significant problems with its bombing campaign as well. There are questions about how discriminate it’s being in target selection and what targets it’s choosing.

But in general, I think the bigger picture is it’s not clear what Israel wants to get out of the current offensive. Their stated objective is to defeat Hamas. It’s not clear what that means based on the current rhetoric, and it’s not clear if the current bombing contributes to it. And if you’re going to inflict this level of suffering on civilians, even unintentionally or as a byproduct of legitimate tactics, you need to have a real endpoint. You need to know what you’re doing.

EZRA KLEIN: In what you have read or heard, or in your reporting, has there been an articulated goal of the siege specifically?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: I have never seen any defense from anyone of the siege that makes sense in my mind. The horrible justifications that you hear from some Israeli leaders are things like, honestly comparing the residents of Gaza to human animals or saying something like that. You’ve heard versions of that language twice from Israeli leaders.

EZRA KLEIN: From the defense minister.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Right. Now, it sounded like he was referring to Hamas. But others —

EZRA KLEIN: But he was specifically talking about the siege. That’s what —

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Yeah.

EZRA KLEIN: That’s what unnerved me about that statement. If he said human animals and he means Hamas, fine. But when what precedes it is we’re cutting off food and water and electricity. That’s clearly not just from Hamas.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: No. It just isn’t reasonable. It’s worse than that. It is an incredible amount of anger being unleashed on civilians who are basically themselves held captive by Hamas, right? Hamas is — contrary to what you may hear from some Israelis — not popular. People don’t like living under an authoritarian theocratic regime. It’s just very, very difficult to rebel and overthrow a government.

There are things that people like about Hamas as well. There are certain social services it provides. They like that, unlike the Palestinian Authority, it stands up to Israel in some visible way, even ways that strike us and are, in fact, morally horrifying. But none of that is a justification or any kind of reasonable justification for hurting this many people.

EZRA KLEIN: So let me offer two different possible rationales for the siege. And the first is maybe the most classic, which is you’re simply literally weakening the enemy. If there is not electricity, and fuel, and food, and water going to Hamas either — I mean, you’ve taken it from a lot of people, but going to them either.

If the population is furious that Hamas has done this to them, if they do hold Hamas at least partially culpable for the Israeli punishment, then maybe you make it easier to uproot Hamas. You weaken Hamas as a fighting force. You weaken their hold on the population. And as brutal as it is, it actually leads to a shorter or at least more winnable conflict. What do you think of that?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: So what happens when you conduct a siege like that is the resources that are left — generators, oil, whatever ways of scrounging up water exist — they get diverted to the military opponent that you’re facing. So what you end up doing might not end up hurting Hamas immediately, but it will, without a doubt, end up doing extraordinary amounts of harm to the civilian population.

The policy isn’t very well thought through on a tactical level. There are some advantages to it. But if you really play it out, it doesn’t do, I think, what some people who are OK with it think it will. And that’s even before we talk about the real problem with it, which is the morality, right?

Sieges are permissible military tactic according to a lot of ethicists when it’s really just an enemy enclave. Ultimately if there’s only fighters there, it’s not very different to blow them up than to starve them out in moral terms. But when civilians are there, it’s a whole different ballgame. And there are two million people in Gaza.

Hamas’s fighting force — I believe the estimate is 30,000. That’s 1.97 million people who you’re starving out, who you’re depriving of water, of adequate sanitation, of medical resources, to get at 30,000. To me, there’s just no way to make those numbers work morally in any kind of humane or remotely defensible military policy.

EZRA KLEIN: So there’s another rationale that I’ve heard, which is if you make life in Gaza untenable, if you make staying in Gaza choosing starvation or waterborne infectious disease or choosing thirst for your children, if you make Gazans flee by the hundreds of thousands, and tell them to do it so they’re not in the way of the bombs, maybe they don’t come back or maybe you don’t let them come back. So you have hundreds of thousands of Gazans just gone.

And one difficulty with that before is that Egypt won’t let them in. But if there’s enough misery, maybe that pushes the Egyptian government to open the border. And so that’s been this other theory of what Israel might be attempting to achieve here. And I’m not saying that it’s moral or according to the rules of war, but it is a coherent strategy if part of Israel’s goal is fewer Palestinians in Gaza.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Yeah, it’s possible that that’s what it is. I mean, you’ve heard at least from one Likud lawmaker in Israel — it’s Netanyahu’s party — saying that what they want is a second Nakba, which means a second catastrophe for Palestinians. And that refers to the 1948 war when Palestinians were, in large part, forced out of lands that’s now controlled by Israel. But it’s not clear to me if that’s actually guiding policy.

Based on my conversations with experts in the area, I don’t think the goal is that well thought out or deliberate. Israeli policymakers were reacting out of rage, out of panic, out of a sense of a need to do something, and imposed a policy that they thought was justified by Hamas’s attack. Now, I don’t think it is personally. But I think it really is, more than anything else, a product of feeling like there’s been this incredible assault on Israel, and they need to do everything they can to address it.

EZRA KLEIN: So one description of Israel’s strategy and where it might be going came from this interview in Politico with Amos Yadlin, who’s former chief of Israeli military intelligence, a sort of important Israeli military thinker. And to situate him, he’s on the center left in Israel, part of Labor.

And he said that “They are thinking of Gaza like a neighboring country run by the government of Hamas,” end quote. “We declare war on this country. And we are going to destroy this state very much like what the Allies did to Germany in 1945, very much like what the U.S. did to ISIS, to the caliphate in Iraq and Syria, 2014 to 2019.”

And so what I take him as saying is that if you shift the metaphor a bit, don’t think of Hamas as a terrorist organization hiding among civilians, think of them as a legitimate government of Gaza, then invading Gaza and destroying the government and the state that attacked you is the most normal thing of all in military history.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: That’s totally right. And it also — in terms of the Israeli thinking — and it also came up — I mean, it’s omnipresent in Israeli discourse. The ISIS analogies and the Nazi analogies, in particular, are really dominant inside the Israeli conversation right now.

One example — I was talking about the siege with an Israeli military historian. I told him that I thought it was very difficult to defend. And he said something like, well, did the Allies provide electricity to the Nazis during World War II? He also, by the way, was a figure on the center left. He said, I support a two-state solution, et cetera.

These aren’t just rabid right-wingers. There’s a consensus in Israel that Hamas really is a neighboring government that needs to be destroyed. The question, I think, is what destroyed means and whether or not you support — you really support what it would mean to try to launch a purely military effort to eliminate Hamas.

EZRA KLEIN: Let’s hold on that for a minute because I want to get to something beneath some of the defenses here that I’ve heard even just from Jewish people more in support of Israel’s current tactics in my own life.

One thing they say — or one thing I hear in what they’re saying — is that they feel Israel, in 2023, is being held to laws and mores of war that did not exist, really, or at least were not followed, when America won the wars that made America what it is today, and among other things, importantly in this, defeated the Nazis, when the countries that exist today won their territory often by displacing other peoples and creating mass migrations.

That there is a demand on Israel to act in a way other states did not have to act because it was not the modern era with all these niceties like the U.N. and phones where you can see what people are doing on the ground. But that in truth, war has always been more brutal. And that when you are trying to eliminate a threat like this, you have to be more brutal. And that Israel’s being held to an unusually high standard that nobody else has demanded their countries in the past meet.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: So I think that’s partially true. But I think a lot of it has to do less with changing norms and double standards than it does with the nature of the Hamas threat itself. And what Hamas has done — there’s actually a technical term for this in the philosophy of just war — it’s called perfidy. It’s a specific kind of abuse of the laws of war where you manipulate them such that your opponent can’t wage war justly, when you force, essentially you use morality as a shield to protect yourself.

And that’s Hamas’s strategy. They want in these military campaigns lots of Palestinian civilians to die. They want them to die rather than their fighters. They want them to die because that’s what helps them win in the long run. It gets them more support. It shows that the Israelis are as brutal as Palestinians think they are. It gets them international sympathy.

They are — the Israelis are forced into fighting a truly evil group. But the fact that they’ve committed perfidy and that they’ve done horrible things doesn’t mean that you can just do whatever you want. If that’s the case, the things that Israel could do are far, far worse than the things that it’s already doing, which is a frightening prospect.

EZRA KLEIN: We’re speaking on Thursday, Oct. 26. As of now, they have not launched the ground invasion of Gaza. The expectation is that they will. I guess we will see. One thing you spent a lot of time doing in your reporting is talking to experts on military strategy, on the region, on counterterrorism, about what it would mean to invade Gaza and whether it would end up making Israel safer, whether it was a good idea. What did you find?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: So I want to start with the actual invasion itself, the we’re going to send troops and we’re going to try to essentially topple the Hamas government as they see it. Well, that’s really hard in military terms. Hamas has this gigantic tunnel network. I’ve heard one description that says it’s larger than the London tube.

EZRA KLEIN: And can I note something about this that I think people don’t fully hear on it?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Sure. Go ahead.

EZRA KLEIN: I think people hear this and they think Hamas has built a bunch of tunnels underground in the last year — a couple of years — in order to make it harder to fight them on the ground in Gaza, like a war-fighting strategy. But this is more than a decade-long project with huge amounts of investment in it because it is the only way the Gazan import/export economy can work.

And so you’re dealing with a tunnel network that I think is much more stunning than people are used to because it wasn’t particularly at the beginning just for a war-fighting purpose. These are not little tunnels to hide a person in so he can pop out and shoot you. These are tunnels that you can bring construction materials through, tunnels that you can bring huge amounts of material in. When I started to understand the depth of the tunnel network, this looked a lot different to me.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Yeah, and that’s layered on top of the ordinary challenges of fighting in an urban environment, which is already on its own very, very difficult. You have to watch for threats from the sky. Drones, for example. You have to watch for threats from the building. Soldiers sniping at your soldiers or firing R.P.G.s. And you have to watch at the street level or whatever it is that Hamas has set up on the ground, plus below you. For invading Israeli soldiers, this is a death trap.

And second, lots and lots of civilians would die, in part because of the Israeli need to protect their own soldiers. There’s a direct trade-off in urban warfare if you’re in a populated area between what you do to preserve your own soldier’s life, which would involve a lot of airstrikes in advance and generally having a pretty loose set of rules of engagement, and what you do to preserve civilian life, which is minimizing the amount of airstrikes that you use and going very slowly and putting your own troops at risk.

EZRA KLEIN: When I hear something like “destroy Hamas” as the objective, I think the question for me that brings up is, what is Hamas? And a couple of answers present. Hamas is people. There are people who hold positions within Hamas or are foot soldiers within Hamas. There’s material, right? They have caches of rockets and drones and so on. It is, to some degree, local support, the attachment from the civilian population that gives them new recruits and allows them to hide within the citizenry, and is why they, to some degree at least, rule Gaza.

So I guess you’re saying you’re going to destroy those three things. I’m sure there are more that you can think of. But I’m curious what you hear when — what do you have to destroy to have destroyed Hamas?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: When I talk to Israelis, there is not a clear sense of what that term means. And in many ways, it’s really the crux of the issue. There’s a consensus on, you need to destroy Hamas. But there’s a question of what that means and what it entails.

I think the ordinary language understanding of it and the one that is most prevalent in the discussion is it means literally end the organization. Destroy the organization that mounted the Oct. 7 attacks and never allow it to constitute itself again. It’s an incredibly tall order. It’s very, very, very hard to do that as any kind of military, even one as well-equipped and advanced and trained as the IDF is.

There’s another meaning of it, though, which is to destroy Hamas’s military capability. Destroy the people who were responsible for this attack and ensure that it could never happen. Again maybe something named Hamas will still exist after that. Maybe it’ll still operate. Maybe it’ll even still rule Gaza. But you can say, if you’re an Israeli, that we destroyed the organization, meaning specifically the people who were in charge and executed the Oct. 7 attack.

Those are two senses of the term, both of which could be used. But I get the strong impression that the former is predominating in Israel.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

EZRA KLEIN: Let’s say they execute a ground invasion, and let’s say that they can do a fair amount. They’re able to degrade a lot of Hamas’s military capabilities. They’re able to kill a number of Hamas’s top leadership, a number of its foot soldiers. Then what?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: So that is the million dollar question. And it is the question that no one I have spoken to and I don’t think anyone in the Israeli government actually has a plan for. I’d really recommend reading a piece in “The Financial Times” on this where they got a bunch of senior Israeli sources on record talking about the planning. It turns out they’re still planning it. This piece was like — at the time we’re recording, it was like a day or two ago.

EZRA KLEIN: We’ll put this piece in the show notes.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: There’s one fantastic quote in there that says, “The Americans went ballistic when they heard that Israel had no plan for what to do in the event after Hamas.” Basically, I think there’s three options, and of them only one of them is really feasible if what you really want to do is destroy Hamas.

So the first one is that you just go in, you wreck the place and you leave. And if that happens, well, Hamas probably just reconstitutes itself. We know, from pretty bitter experience on the American side, that you can’t take out a terrorist organization in one fell swoop.

A second option would be to install some kind of collaborationist Palestinian government and then leave. The problem with that is if you don’t back it with armed force, Hamas or some other kind of Palestinian militant — there are a lot of them in the Gaza Strip — end up toppling this government and you’re right back where you started.

So the third option, and the one that strikes me as most likely based on my own conversations with Israelis, is an extended occupation of Gaza. If you really want to destroy the entity that calls itself Hamas, the most literal definition, that’s what you have to do.

You go to Gaza. You occupy it for a long period of time. You engage in a pretty lengthy counterinsurgency campaign designed to topple the government, designed to ensure that Hamas — that its support is entirely stamped out among the population and it lacks its ability to rebuild. And then, only then, after a very long period of fighting, do you try to create a government that can operate without Israeli forces on the ground.

This, to me, seems like a nightmarish option for any number of reasons. But right now I’m worried, based on what’s coming out of the Israeli government, that that’s what they’re sort of sleepwalking towards.

EZRA KLEIN: Why is that a nightmarish option? They occupied Gaza for a long time. And I don’t think right now the pullout — and I think it’s strange language because it kept the blockade and a lot of control over it — but they did not occupy Gaza in the way they had. They did not try to govern it in the way they had. And I don’t think right now they look at that as a success.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: No, I mean, look, Hamas built itself while Israel was occupying Gaza, right? That’s when the organization really came to prominence in the 1990s when it conducted a series of terrorist attacks inside Israel that were very explicitly designed to disrupt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process at that time. And this was Israel was still occupying Gaza. So that’s one thing, right, is that doesn’t really work if you look at the historical record.

The other thing is looking at different kinds of historical records, namely the experience of countries occupying what are essentially foreign countries in a counterinsurgency campaign. And it’s quite bad. These very often fail to accomplish their goal of creating a peaceful post-war environment. They create a situation where these terrorist groups can reconstitute themselves often in worse forms. That’s the origin story of ISIS. It really grew out of al-Qaeda in Iraq, which was itself not very strong until the U.S. invaded Iraq.

EZRA KLEIN: One thing that I feel like people who know a lot about ISIS are being driven crazy by right now is that the analogy to ISIS, which has become so popular — Hamas as ISIS — runs the other way.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Yeah, it’s like you don’t want to encourage the growth of — I mean, you can’t say a worse version of Hamas. They’re already pretty horrible, right? But an environment where they can reconstitute themselves in even stronger form. Because there are two important salient facts about how that might and probably would happen.

The first is something that Marc Lynch, who’s an expert on Arab politics, told me when I was talking to him, is he’s like, look, when the U.S. invaded Iraq, there were some real constituencies — Shia, Kurds, who hated Saddam Hussein and had some interest in cooperating with the invaders. There’s nothing like that in Gaza. Nothing. Everyone hates Israel. They hate Israel because of the years of occupation prior to Hamas. They hate Israel because of the blockade. They hate Israel because of all the bombing campaigns.

There’s no group in Gaza that would welcome or cooperate with an Israeli counterinsurgency campaign, which means you’re in there with Israeli forces who are getting shot at by Hamas partisans who are hiding among the population all the time. It’s the nightmare scenario for any effort to try to impose governance on a society. Who’s going to cooperate with you? Who are you going to get to run the government when you can’t do it? It’s just — there’s no plausible, to me, end game for how you bring peace to such an environment.

And really the most likely outcome — and this is the second thing I was alluding to — is that Hamas builds its support among Palestinians because it shows itself to be resisting the Israeli occupation. And even if Israel has good intentions, the best possible intentions, which they may not, war crimes happen as part of these occupations. They do. They’re inevitable.

Every time that happens, Hamas gains new supporters. Every Palestinian child who’s killed by an Israeli bomb or accidentally shot by an Israeli ground soldier, blown up by a tank, every single one of those is a victory for Hamas.

EZRA KLEIN: I think sometimes about the math of vengeance in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And one of the things that’s been on my mind is our attunement to the Israeli math right now, right? Joe Biden’s saying that Oct. 7 was like 15 9/11s when you adjust for population.

So Gaza is smaller than Israel. Two million people. We don’t really know the exact number of killed Gazans at this point. But it seems safe to say it’s significantly higher than 1,400 in a smaller area. There have been many killed before this, of course, over years and years of fighting. So what percentage of Gazans are one degree away or know somebody one degree away from somebody killed in an Israeli attack? I would assume that it approaches 100 percent.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Very high. I mean, look, if you talk to Israelis, almost everybody knows somebody.

EZRA KLEIN: Right. And I think we have a sensitivity to that, right? It fills me with despair when I think about that. But that is — I mean, put aside the question of Hamas, that is the wellspring of conflict, whether that conflict organizes itself under the banner of Hamas or not. Everything that Israelis feel right now in wanting to avenge their dead, Palestinians feel too. And as you keep adding more fuel of vengeance, I mean that does create this long-term question, even aside from its short-term horror, of where does that go?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: I mean, look, the most cliché term in Middle East politics, or specifically Arab-Israeli politics, is cycle of violence. But it’s cliché for a reason because it’s true for exactly the reasons that you just described. When you inflict violence on one group, they demand a violent response. It just is the way that this conflict has gone forever.

And so the purpose of violence, if what you want is peace in the end — and that is not true for all of the actors in this conflict — but if what you want is peace, violence should only be used as a tactical measure in order to gain some degree of security that allows you to make longer-term steps for peace and movements towards peace.

And that’s just not what’s happening right now. The Hamas attack was the opposite of that. It was designed — some experts on Hamas think that the spectacular brutality, I mean the truly awful description of what happened to Israeli civilians on that day — I’m not going to get into them for the mental health of your listeners, but it’s beyond evil to hear about — that that was the point.

Those kinds of atrocities would force such a heavy-handed response to Israel that violent resistance in the Palestinian orbit would become the only acceptable cause, and that the more peaceful approach of the Palestinian Authority and the Fatah party would be discredited.

EZRA KLEIN: In some ways, it’s easy to know so much about the Israel-Palestine conflict, so much about its tortured contested history, who did what at the Camp David talks in 2000, and what was going on in Oslo and the Second Intifada. You get really caught up in the specifics of it, and often correctly so.

But we actually know some things about terrorism broadly. Sometimes I think it is useful to abstract out of this conflict and think about others. And you talked to Audrey Kurth Cronin, who’s a military strategy expert and the author of the book “How Terrorism Ends,” which is probably the best study of how terrorism ends. What does her research say?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: So one of Audrey’s main research questions was the extent to which what she calls repression — that’s just violence, basically, of various different forms — is effective at dealing with terrorism and addressing it. And what she found in the roughly 460 cases that she examined is that it’s not. It doesn’t typically work. And there are lots of reasons for that.

One of them is that the amount of violence that you need to do over a long period of time to repress a terrorist organization is, A, huge, and B, often quite indiscriminate. One thing I’ve learned from other studies of war and conflict is that a lot of civilian allegiance depends — and this is sort of very intuitive and surprising people don’t think about it more — it depends on their own self-interest.

If you are literally going to die because you don’t collaborate with X group, then you’ll collaborate with X group regardless of what your ideological or other allegiances incline you towards. There’s a great book on this by Stathis Kalyvas, who’s a Greek political scientist. It’s called “The Logic of Violence in Civil Wars.”

But what that means is to really get civilians to not want to cooperate with an insurgent or terrorist group, a lot of the time that entails threatening their lives in very, very, very large numbers, directly and intentionally. Committing war crimes, right? So a good example of this is the Sri Lankan military’s defeat of the Tamil Tigers. It took many years, was extremely bloody, and involved wide-scale repression of the Tamil population.

Israel will have a very hard time doing that. I know there’s a lot of critics of Israel right now accusing it of committing an incipient genocide. There’s not a lot of evidence that that’s happening, in part because the Israeli military is so strong that it could do so much more if what it really wanted to do was exterminate the Palestinian population or force them into a choice where it’s give up on Hamas or we kill you. They’re not being super discriminate, but they’re not being indiscriminate either.

And this speaks to something that Audrey told me, which I think is really insightful. She said that Israel, as a democracy, is really ill-suited to do that kind of strategy.

EZRA KLEIN: The strategy of overwhelming repression.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: That’s right. Because whatever you think about Israel or whatever you think about the politics, its treatment of the Palestinians, there’s a really essential self-conception of Israel as a democracy. It really matters. Even the parties on the extreme right claim to be standing up for Israeli democracy. And there’s a certain set of values associated with that that matter to the population. And so there’s a level of force, a pretty significant level of force they can countenance against Palestinians.

But the level of force required to engage in pure repression strategy is well beyond that. I mean, however bad you think this conflict is, a full scale repression strategy would be much, much, much, much worse. Much, much, much, much worse. And it just seems very hard to imagine the Israeli government doing that because it would cost them everything, both domestically and geopolitically. The U.S. — I mean, that’s the kind of thing that could force the U.S. to abandon Israel.

EZRA KLEIN: So if overwhelming repression doesn’t typically work, what does?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: I mean, a lot of it isn’t something that external actors do, right? Sometimes terrorist groups just implode. Sometimes they get overtaken by a rival for political supremacy for one reason or another. But the one that you can have some influence over, it looks like, is addressing the political foundations of that terrorist group support and doing something to address the grievances that fuel it or coming to some kind of political agreement with the group itself.

Here, the classic textbook example are the Good Friday Accords that ended the conflict in Northern Ireland between the I.R.A. and the British government. Good Friday was a very long process. I mean, getting there was a long and violent one. Not quite so violent as the Israel-Palestine conflict, but it was very serious. Eventually, what led to the end of that insurgency was a negotiated settlement.

That probably is not possible with Hamas. But there are other ways that you can change the political equation so you can encourage some of these other ways that terrorist groups end, like, for instance, being supplanted by an alternative faction.

EZRA KLEIN: I want to put a hold because we’re going to talk about the political equation. But before we get to that, you end up, after all this reporting, when thinking about the short-term military question, saying, “Of all possible options, a focused counterterrorism strategy is the best, most realistic military option available on every level, strategically, morally and politically.”

So I want to begin here with definition. What is a counterterrorism strategy? What distinguishes it from things like a Gazan ground invasion, et cetera?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: No, there might be a ground component to it. So I don’t want to say that’s not at all happening. But the key difference is the question of regime change. Does the Israeli military go in with the intent of putting tanks on the streets of Gaza City and setting up some kind of alternative governing arrangement inside Gaza, or at least creating room for one, or is the goal to, as we discussed a little bit earlier, degrade Hamas to the point where it will no longer be able to pose a threat, at least in the immediate term, to Israeli civilians, other than the occasional sporadic rocket fire that’s very hard to repress?

And the latter option is what I come to think of as a counterterrorism operation. And it has a few very nitty-gritty parts to it. One of them is minimizing your ground invasion. Israel shouldn’t try to just conquer the whole territory, but rather target specifically, in any ground initiatives that it does, Hamas leadership and the people who perpetrated the Oct. 7 attack and anyone else who might be in a position to plan or organize a similar kind of attack.

So that may mean ground incursions. It might not. It’s hard for me to say without access to a lot of classified intelligence that the Israelis aren’t sharing with me. But one thing it probably does entail are significant special forces raids inside Gaza. They’re not omnipotent, but they can be much more discriminate in the way that they fight than regular military can be. It means — I mean, this is gruesome to talk about, but an extended assassination campaign targeting Hamas leaders, both in Gaza and elsewhere.

EZRA KLEIN: Which they have done before.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Correct. Right. So at the end of the Second Intifada, which is in the roughly early mid-2000s, Israel engaged in this concerted effort to kill anyone who it seemed was the Hamas leader. At one point, this had proven so successful that Hamas didn’t want to name whoever their next leader was. They said, we have a new leader, but we won’t tell you who it is because they were so afraid that that person would also be killed by an Israeli bomb or an Israeli bullet. And that did seem to have an effect on Hamas’s violence at that point in time.

Basically, there are only so many people who have the skills to plan a terrorist attack. There are only so many people who know how to build bombs. There’s only so many people who are charismatic enough to inspire effective support from underlings. So if you really engage in a significant extended campaign to kill those people, it can have an effect on the ability of that group to plan and execute attacks. It can’t end the group.

But here, another good example is what the U.S. actually did do right in Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda is a shadow of itself right now than it was beforehand. The group is not eliminated, but its capacity to pose a threat to the U.S. homeland is dramatically diminished, even with the Taliban in charge of Afghanistan.

You can say the same thing about ISIS after the International counterterrorism campaign against them. They don’t really control the territory that they controlled in Iraq and Syria in the past. This can work even if it can’t destroy the group. But what it does — what it really is is a containment strategy rather than actually we’re going to destroy, in the literal sense of destroy, the organization.

EZRA KLEIN: Distinguish this a little bit more for me because what I’m hearing is a distinction of degrees not necessarily of kind. This might include a ground incursion, maybe even a ground invasion. When the experts you spoke to say they should do this and not that, how did they draw the line?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Well, one way to do it is duration. So Dan Byman, who’s a professor at Georgetown who studies Israeli counterterrorism strategy, told me that they should plan any ground operation to last for at most a matter of weeks, rather than months, or, as one Israeli source suggested, up to 10 years of potential fighting in Gaza. This is an order of magnitude — many orders of magnitude probably — different in terms of the scale of the operation.

The objectives are different. It’s not taking out literally everything that the group can do. It’s about degrading its capacity to engage in violence. So rather than destroying the institutions that Hamas has set up to function as a governing entity in Gaza, you target, more specifically, the political and military leadership who ordered the attack.

It’s the difference between regime change and counterterrorism. I know I’m using the word — that buzzword to describe it — but I think that’s a really important and, in many ways, intuitive distinction.

EZRA KLEIN: What does counterterrorism mean? And honestly, what do any of these paths mean for the hostages? I think it’s important not to forget their existence here, right? Hamas still has — I don’t know the exact number — but a very significant number —

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Around 200.

EZRA KLEIN: — around 200 of hostages who are being held somewhere. They see them as their bargaining chips. How does this speak to the goal of getting them home?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Yeah, I mean, it’s a really, really grim situation when it comes to hostages. It’s not clear to me that there is anything that Israel can give Hamas that they’d be willing to pay that can get the hostages back in negotiations. They’re trying right now. There are internationally brokered talks. The U.S. is involved. Qatar is involved as a sort of international Hamas patron. And those need to keep happening. And they obviously are happening in a parallel track to Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, which is ongoing.

I wrote in the piece that Israel should try, as best as it can, to get intelligence on where they are and mount rescue operations. I also noted that the prospects of success for that are really dim, in part because of the tunnel stuff we were talking about for a while. When you have this giant confusing warren underneath Gaza, it’s going to be very, very, very hard for Israel to figure out exactly where people are and to get a special forces team in position to actually bring hostages out, that’s logistically difficult for all kinds of different reasons.

So it’s awful. It’s less awful than a full-scale ground invasion would be. The reason for that is if you make it seem like Hamas is about to be destroyed fully, they have every incentive to start executing hostages. I can’t say there’s any way to stop that from happening. This is in the nature of Hamas. They specifically designed their strategy around horrific instances of violence in order to terrify and incite disproportionate responses from the Israelis.

So it’s — I mean, I don’t think anyone has a good answer to this, honestly. I wish I could give you a better one. No one I spoke to had a solution to this that was anything like satisfying.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

EZRA KLEIN: It’s well-reported by now that as part of the tremendous intelligence failure on the Israeli side, they could see Hamas preparing for this assault. They could see Hamas playing its war games and practicing its incursions. And they just didn’t think much of it. They thought that Hamas would never attempt something like this. So whatever Hamas was doing, they didn’t intend to go through with it. They were either trying to threaten Israel or just show that they have capabilities or whatever. But then they actually did do it.

That’s what I’ve heard from a lot of Israelis. That the key mistake was thinking that we had pacified Hamas and that Hamas now had responsibilities to the Gazans and was not going to do something like this and incur this kind of wrath. And that’s why they didn’t take them seriously.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Yeah, I think there’s two components to that. The first one you just alluded to is deterrence. So Israel has, for a long time, had a policy towards Hamas of what they call mowing the grass, which is Hamas gets strong, it builds up its military, there’s some kind of escalation, they fight an air war, degrade Hamas’s capacity to launch attacks, and the whole cycle starts over.

It’s a pretty euphemistic description of what really means lots of people dying. But the Israelis thought that the punishment they’d inflicted on Hamas during these repeated episodes had made it such that they don’t want to do, well, what they just did.

And the second thing is that the government had calculated that they had other interests related here that outweighed the potential terrorist threat from Hamas, which they deemed limited. And here, I’m talking specifically about defanging the two-state solution. Benjamin Netanyahu has been a very, very, very long time opponent of any kind of negotiated solution with the Palestinians.

Netanyahu even said that this was part of his strategy at a Likud closed door meeting. He said, and I quote, “Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas.” He continues, “This is part of our strategy to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in the West Bank.” Now, this is single source. We don’t know if that’s exactly what he said. But it’s been widely reported that something like that was said at the meeting.

EZRA KLEIN: And it’s what they were doing.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Yeah, it is what they were doing. The policy — there’s a very good piece by Tal Schneider, who’s a reporter at the Times of Israel, detailing all the different policy mechanisms that were used to pursue this policy. And one of them was, for instance, facilitating monetary payments from Qatar to Hamas that would allow them to stabilize their regime. They had thought that this was a winning strategy for their ultimate geopolitical objective of allowing Israel to continue to colonize the West Bank unimpeded.

EZRA KLEIN: So when I was preparing for this conversation, I read this piece by Lawrence Freedman, who is a professor of war studies at King’s College. And he wrote this in the F.T. And this one line has just been ringing in my head, which is that “Israel is trying to develop a military strategy to deal with the Hamas threat while it lacks a political strategy.”

Something that it seems everybody told you, too, is that, OK, a counterterrorism operation is one piece of this. But as you were saying around the research in how terrorism ends, a political strategy, something that saps the underlying support for the terrorist group is the only long-term solution.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Yes. I think that’s basically correct.

EZRA KLEIN: First, at this point, do you agree with Freedman that there is no dominant political strategy in Israel?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Yeah, there just isn’t. I mean, up until now there was a strategy of containing Hamas and of propping it up. Just thinking that you can deter them from launching large-scale attacks and it’s a manageable problem. Since that strategy has been blown up — I mean, it’s been blown up since Oct. 7. It’s been a matter of weeks. And Israel has not developed an entirely new national security strategy in weeks.

They don’t know what they’re doing, the current government, because they are forced to reconsider every single assumption they had about how to guarantee security for their own population. I mean, there’s just no sense of what should be done in the long-term. There’s a sense of what we need to do immediately among Israelis. But there really is not a broader strategy in place yet.

EZRA KLEIN: But is there even one on the shelf? So for a very long time I think the strategy was a two-state solution. Not necessarily agreed on by all Israelis, but that was the international working framework for what everybody was eventually going to do here. And obviously the details of that were very contested. In recent years, that was moved away from. And the facts on the ground moved against that. There are too many settlements. Too little trust between the parties.

And I don’t know that there was really a dominant alternative that emerged. But I do think there were things like it. Something I’ve been thinking about is a paper written by Bezalel Smotrich, who is now the finance minister, pretty hard right guy. But he had this big 2017 analysis of what he thought should be done. And it, I think, is a reminder that there were other ideas floating around.

So he writes, quote, “Ending the conflict means creating and cementing the awareness, practically and politically, that there is room for only one expression of national self-determination West of the Jordan River, that of the Jewish nation. Subsequently, an Arab state actualizing Arab national aspirations cannot emerge within the same territory. Victory involves shelving this dream. And as motivation for its fulfillment dwindles, so will the terror campaign against Israel.”

And his basic prescription in that — I mean, which I think we can fairly call apartheid — is consistent repression. But as the terrorism threat recedes, Israel is governing a large state that includes a number of Palestinian second-class citizens who have better or worse lives, depending on how they are acting. But eventually, their hope for a state is extinguished and either they leave or they settle into the Israeli status quo. And Israel can treat them better under those terms.

And that that is a form of a Jewish one-state solution that I’m not saying everybody agreed with. But I don’t know, I think if you look at what Israel was doing, it doesn’t look totally off the path they were on.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Yeah. I think people outside of Israel and the policy circles that discuss this underestimate the importance of this paper. They probably never heard of it. But it’s really, I think, very significant in describing what the current government was doing prior to Oct. 7. Not all of Israel or even all of Netanyahu’s different governments, but the current one, which is — I mean, it’s the most extreme right-wing government in Israel’s history.

EZRA KLEIN: And he’s in it, notably, Smotrich. He’s finance minister. It’s a big job.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Yeah, and not just finance minister. His job has been structured such that he has control over the West Bank policy, basically. So he could determine what was going on in that component of the occupied territories. And one thing that’s really striking about this paper, from our current vantage point, is that he doesn’t talk about Gaza at all.

It’s not really a problem for him. He thought that Israel could secure its long-term future by pacifying the West Bank. And you can pacify the West Bank by depriving Palestinians of hope.

Now, it turns out every element of that assumption was wrong. We now know, because of Oct. 7, it wasn’t working. But we also know that it’s what he was trying to do.

I mean, Israel was moving towards de facto annexation of the West Bank prior to Oct. 7, which means merging Israeli domestic law with the law of the occupied territories. They’ve been kept separate because the notion of the occupation was that it was temporary, that eventually Israel would leave. It wasn’t annexing this land. But under Smotrich and his policies towards the West Bank, we were moving closer and closer towards a formal de facto in the sense of not announced, but formal integration of the laws and formal annexation of the West Bank.

EZRA KLEIN: But what choice was there except for that? I mean, I think when people think of the settlements — I mean, just picture in your head what the number is you think live in the settlements in the West Bank. The implication of the term is that it’s modest. It’s 700,000 people.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Yeah.

EZRA KLEIN: That’s significant. I mean, the idea that Israel is not governing — I mean, they are Israeli citizens obviously. The idea that Israel is not governing them and thus the territory in which they live, a portion of its population that significant, is absurd.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Yeah. I mean, there’s an important caveat there, which is that a lot of the settlements and the large population of them live just on the border with Israel proper and really in areas near Jerusalem. They’re functionally suburbs of Jerusalem.

And so in most of the peace proposals or the maps that people have drawn up, a lot of those get annexed to Israel in exchange for territorial swaps that are currently Israeli territories going to a Palestinian territory. So those settlements are less of a problem. And they are the main population center.

That being said, you’re right on the basics of the situation. I mean, they’re scattered all around. And they’re scattered all around, by the way, by design. The point of the placement of a lot of these settlements is to cut off Palestinian communities from each other.

And by that I don’t just mean it’s between them. I mean, because of what Israel has to do to secure settlers who might otherwise be vulnerable to attacks from Palestinian militant groups, you end up creating this situation where it’s extremely difficult for Palestinians to get around, for their communities to be connected.

I mean, in one place that I went to outside of Jerusalem, there is one home part of a Palestinian town. It’s a little bit off from the town center, but that puts it directly adjacent to an Israeli settlement. Now, the settlers didn’t want Palestinians coming into their land.

So what did the Israeli military do? They built a cage around this house. And they built a walkway that’s all fenced in that connects the house to the village that it’s nominally a part of. So the people who live there have to walk by settlers who are on the outside of what’s essentially their home as a prison and sees them walking by to get into the town.

It’s hard to overstate how disruptive the settlement enterprise is for Palestinians. The political barrier to dismantling all of this is figuring out how to get those people out of there. Not logistically, that’s not actually that difficult. It’s surmounting the political opposition to the trauma that it would cause. The disengagement from Gaza was very difficult for Israelis to begin with.

EZRA KLEIN: I think the biggest difference in the politics of this issue over the past 20 years is a number of people who now believe the two-state solution is dead. There are no end of pieces in places like foreign affairs where this would not have really been sayable 20 years ago for the exact reason you just said. The number of settlers, the number of people you’d have to pull back into Israel, the amount of political power they have, how politically impossible that looks.

There is no two-state solution because even before you get to all these other questions, like right of return and a lot of other things that I think often get ignored in how hard a significant settlement would be, you cannot unwind the settlement growth of the past 20 years. And if you can’t unwind that, there is no land swap that would create a Palestinian state that makes any sense. Now, you’re more optimistic on this. But I’d like to hear why. Because I actually find that quite convincing.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Optimistic is the wrong word, right? It’s more that as hard as it seems to get to a two-state solution from where we are right now, it’s that all of the alternatives are even less viable. And you have to go somewhere. Stasis is not possible. I think that’s one lesson of Oct. 7.

As horrible as it is, we now know that Israel trying to maintain the kind of relationship it has with Palestinians, both in Gaza and the West Bank, is not durable. In the long run, there will continue to be unpredictable spurts of violence and that will cause something to change. The question is, what is it going to change towards?

EZRA KLEIN: But I think it is a conceptual mistake that is very common among people who study any kind of policy to believe that a problem will ultimately end in a solution.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Sure.

EZRA KLEIN: That there will be some answer that answer the problem. But you can have much more extended misery than I think people tend to believe in policy circles. You can have very complicated muddling throughs. And so the place I have moved to is that I, in some ways, think the whole conversation about one state and two state has become weirdly — it’s like too far, right? You need precursors to just better than this.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: No, I think that’s right.

EZRA KLEIN: So when you talk to people about what are the strategies that could begin to shift the political equilibrium of the conflict in a tactical and specific way, what did they say? Not what could end it all. Like, what could you do, incrementally, slowly, year by year, that might be trust-building, that might begin to pry open doors just a little bit that feel closed now?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Yeah, look, I think it’s important to understand that the occupation of the West Bank, which is where most of these changes would happen, is an immensely complicated legal, political, and military institution. It depends on lots of different policies to expand. And you can start changing some of them. You can start rolling some of them back to make life better for ordinary Palestinians, which is, I think, really the key to this political situation is to show Palestinians that there’s a way forward that doesn’t involve violence.

EZRA KLEIN: So like what? What could you roll back?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: So one would be land use policies. A lot of what Israel does right now in the area is to change land regulations such that it’s easy for settlements, or at least easier, for settlers to take over different Palestinian land. And there are a number of specific things. You even see some that are related to national park services that are used as basically pretexts to grab Palestinian land.

Another one would be cutting down or dismantling some of the checkpoints that dot the West Bank and that make it hard for Palestinians to move around from one place to another. Cutting down on those would substantially improve the Palestinian economy.

The third would be a cash investment. This is a policy that the former Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad pursued, which is a policy of economic development. It didn’t work out for a variety of reasons. It’s not really Fayyad’s fault, in my view. It’s a fault of the sclerotic Palestinian political organization and an Israeli government that really wasn’t very interested in making Palestinian lives a lot better.

That’s something international donors could help change. There’s already a lot of money going in. There are better ways to organize that funding. We can go through dozens of different specific, very nitty-gritty specific policies.

Or another one — start doing a better job at preventing provocations from right-wing Israelis on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Like going in, storming into Al-Aqsa Mosque and praying ostentatiously, claiming the land, claiming the Temple Mount and the mosque for Jews. That kind of thing has the tendency to really explode tensions between the two groups.

EZRA KLEIN: One reason Hamas called their operation Al-Aqsa Flood.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Correct, correct. Israel does so much right now that enables the growth of settlements and that really makes life horrible and anger-inducing for a lot of ordinary Palestinians. But one other thing that Oct. 7 has done is discredit Benjamin Netanyahu among the Israeli public.

I mean, if you look at every piece of polling data right now on his approval rating, on a hypothetical election, I mean, his numbers have collapsed because Israelis, very rightly, blame him for what happened. They blame his strategy, his approach to Israeli security for what happened.

So for the first time in a long time, Israel has been really caught in this political logjam. And for the first time in a long time, it seems as if there could be something new politically that could happen that could actually have a durable base and a large one among the Israeli population.

EZRA KLEIN: This speaks to, I think, another very dominant view right now in Israel, which was something people were saying before this, which is given I think credibility after the attacks, which is that Netanyahu and his government were weakening Israel by dividing Israel so profoundly internally over things like the judicial reforms, that the effort to change the character of Israel as a state was something that made it impossible for Israel to keep focus on its actual threats. And I’m curious how you rate where that anger sits now and what that may or may not make possible.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: I mean, it’s still pretty profound. There are these videos — I don’t know if you’ve seen them. Have you, Ezra, of government ministers getting yelled at by ordinary Israelis?

EZRA KLEIN: Yeah, I have.

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: Yeah, so they get screamed at by ordinary Israelis who blame them for what happened. And it’s easy to forget now, given how different the world seems after Hamas’s attack, but Israel had been experiencing the largest protests of its entire history for most of this year against the judicial reform. This was an issue, an attempt really to alter the foundation of Israeli democracy that was vastly unpopular and significantly undercut trust in the government.

Netanyahu’s approval ratings were bad before the worst terrorist attack in Israeli history happened under his watch. He’s currently on trial on charges related to corruption, some of which are quite serious. There’s no trust from the Israeli political mainstream. He has a hard core of supporters, but people don’t believe him to be the guarantor of their security or of their country’s prosperity or political future that they thought he once was.

So that creates a tremendous opening for there to be some kind of political alternative. Now, what that alternative looks like not quite as obvious.

Right now the polling suggests that Benny Gantz, who has joined an emergency coalition with Netanyahu, is the primary beneficiary of public dissent. This makes sense. Gantz is sort of a centrist, center right-type figure, former general, very hawkish on the Palestinian conflict. Not on settlements, though.

He’s hawkish — and this is another poorly understood dividing line outside of Israel — the people who are most hardcore about the settlements are not always the people who are most hardcore about responding to terrorist attacks with force. There’s a correlation there but they can be delinked. So Gantz is very, very aggressive when it comes to military attacks. But he is not ideologically committed to settlements.

And there’s another person aligned with him, Gadi Eizenkot, former chief of staff of the IDF, who probably would be even more inclined, if given a position of power, to wind down or at least roll back some of what has been done under Netanyahu to entrench Israeli control over the West Bank. So if he’s defense minister, let’s say, we could see a very, very different West Bank policy in the event that politics change as much as polls suggest they’re going to.

EZRA KLEIN: And then always our final question. What are three books you would recommend to the audience?

ZACK BEAUCHAMP: So I want to start with “A High Price,” which is Dan Byman’s history of Israeli counterterrorism policy. It’s a little bit dated now and was published about 10 years ago or so. But to my mind, it’s one of the best serious interrogations of what Israel does or what its playbook is for dealing with terrorist groups, where it works and where it doesn’t. I learned a lot from reading Dan’s book.

A second book I’d recommend is “The Selected Works of Edward Said,” who’s a famous Palestinian-American intellectual. There’s a lot in there that’s not related to the conflict. But Said is one of the most articulate exponents ever to live of the Palestinian cause. And if you want to understand where Palestinians are coming from and how they feel about Israeli occupation, it’s hard to do better than going to Said’s work.

And the third book I’d recommend, since we spent so much time talking about the West Bank, is a book by an Israeli journalist named Gershom Gorenberg called “The Accidental Empire.” And I love Gorenberg’s book because he really traces the history of how settlements emerged, the ways in which Israeli policy facilitated their development, and the ways in which Israeli governments were taken by surprise by what they had allowed to happen, and how settlers themselves pioneered this fundamental transformation to the conflict that was not necessarily, although at times it seemed like it was, part of Israeli strategic design. It’s a really, I think, an essential insight into how things got to the point where they’re at right now.

EZRA KLEIN: Zack Beauchamp, thank you very much.

329,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/opinion/ceasefire-israel-gaza-bombardment.html,"Getting bombed from the sky is a particular horror: The sense that death hangs quite literally over your head, invisible until it’s too late, and maybe it will hit you. Maybe this moment. Or this. Or this. Every heartbeat hammering through your skull.

I’ve watched U.S. warplanes attack Afghanistan; barely escaped a direct strike from a Russian MiG in Georgia, and lived for weeks under relentless Israeli bombardment in Lebanon.

The images from Gaza bring back memories I usually keep buried. The thunder of the bombs, drifts of broken glass and twisted rebar where houses and shops once stood, dust and the smell of blood mixing in the throat. Very small bodies, and very old bodies. The rage of a funeral under bombs in Lebanon, a hospital truck and a trench for a mass grave, planes still in the sky, women keening, praying for souls and revenge.

As bad as that was, Gaza is incalculably worse. I have never experienced the merciless pace of airstrikes and death now being suffered by the people of Gaza — people who did not travel to a war zone as foreign reporters, but who are getting attacked at home, with their children and grandparents. People who already lived under blockade, and never had any real possibility of escape.

White House officials have said a cease-fire only benefits Hamas; that even to ask for the bombing to stop is “disgraceful” and “repugnant.” I find myself thinking that, had these officials ever experienced even one day under bombardment and shelling, they could not so blithely, so unambiguously, defend this nightmarish attack on Gaza.

Israel has so far killed more than 8,000 people, the Gaza Health Ministry said, more than 40 percent of them children. The ministry, having no doubt heard President Biden suggesting they could be lying about their casualties, released a registry of the dead — page after page of names, dozens of members of the same family.

It was clear from the start, in the earliest hours after Hamas slaughtered and kidnapped Israeli civilians, that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel had no mercy in mind for Gaza. “All of the places which Hamas is deployed, hiding and operating in, that wicked city, we will turn them into rubble,” he said.

If the people of Gaza are just a political abstraction, perhaps it’s easier to tell yourself that the killing of their children is sad but unavoidable — an unintended and ultimately forgivable consequence of a nation’s righteous pursuit of self-defense.

But having spent time under bombardment, and having reported in Gaza, I have no time for these explanations. If diplomacy and international relations can acquiesce to this kind of war, then what is the point of diplomacy and international relations? What outcome does this strategy avert that would be worse than the outcome it has already created?

But they say we should not call for a cease-fire.

The atrocities committed by Hamas against Israeli civilians on Oct. 7 were shocking and evil. The vicious attack, which killed more Jews in a single day than any day since the Holocaust, cries out for an answer.

Killing the children of Gaza, however, is not the answer.

If we are to believe the Israeli political and military leadership’s own words — and I think we should — the assault on Gaza was driven, first, by straightforward vengeance.

“You wanted hell, you will get hell,” Maj. Gen. Ghassan Alian of the Israel Defense Forces warned the residents of Gaza, whom he referred to as “human beasts.”

Israel’s minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, declared that Israel would “do whatever we have to do” to send a message.

“Gaza won’t return to what it was before,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said. “We will eliminate everything.”

Mass slaughter is immoral, of course, but — making it even more tragic — it also doesn’t work. Quite the opposite.

Looking at pictures of the ominous lunar landscapes of bomb-crushed Gazan blocks, I see the birth of a new generation of fighters. Or terrorists, if you like — I don’t see why it matters very much. The children who survive this onslaught will grow even more radicalized and traumatized than the generations who came before.

Palestinian violence is rooted in the political grievance of generations of Palestinians, whose lives are defined by open-ended military occupation. They have no state to call their own, their basic rights are systematically curtailed and the world has given them little reason to anticipate better days. Palestinian political violence is older than Hamas, extends beyond Hamas across society, and will surely outlive Hamas in the absence of a political solution.

Israel knows this. Israel has bombed Gaza pitilessly before, but Hamas is still there. Israel turned parts of southern Lebanon to rubble, but Hezbollah is still there.

As Americans, we too should have learned this lesson over and over again. All the military might of the United States could not defeat the ragtag bands of Taliban or force a nation of conquered Iraqis to accept a U.S. occupation. Maybe we don’t want to understand.

But they say we can’t call for a cease-fire.

I have eaten in Gaza, laughed there, slept there, seen the sea there. I can’t match my memories to the strange depictions I see on the news of an irreal and uncivilized place inconveniently built atop a nest of terrorist tunnels.

Gaza is a real place crammed full of real people. Indefatigable people, annoying people, hilarious people, duplicitous people, all the usual types of people. Lots and lots of children, so many kids you sometimes waded through them in the streets, scrambling and touching and hollering, tugging on your clothes, slipping hands into pockets. The children of Gaza, I won’t lie, were often a nuisance. But a beautiful nuisance, an untamed burst of irrepressible life in harsh circumstances.

I imagine Gaza now, how it must be. I know that it must be like hell, like a hallucination, like time itself is stretched and stuck. I know at such times there is only one coherent thought: Stop the bombs. I was in southern Lebanon in 2006, when Israel bombed medical teams and fleeing civilians and villages filled with people too old or disabled to get away, and what I remember now is the pain of knowing that the rest of the world was flowing along as usual. Knowing they could stop the bombs, but chose not to. Not just yet; a little more death first.

I can still feel the rage that surged — in the people who were around me and within my own mind — against a powerful nation that would kill like that, from a distance.

To be honest, I feel that I have now crossed to the wrong side of things. Now I sit clean and safe in America while far away the bombs fall.

Before I went to Israel, an editor tried to convince me it was a bad idea. “You’re a writer, and you like to choose pretty words,” the editor said. “In Jerusalem you can’t use the pretty words. You have to use the careful words.” The editor was right. Writing about Israel is full of careful words and careless killing. We nitpick every last point until no reader can decipher what we’re saying anymore. Now we say the death tolls are not true. How do we know? Things are happening — what things? We could find out with a cease-fire, but they say we can’t ask for a cease-fire.

And here we are, watching the cycle spin around again, pretending to think it might have a different result this time. Like it’s all just a game with improbable but not impossible odds.

We give Israel money to pay for the weapons. Then we give Palestinians money to pay for the damage done by those weapons. We keep doing the same things, repeating the same lines, but the violence just gets worse."

331,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/nyregion/hochul-hate-crimes-ny.html,"Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York announced on Tuesday up to $75 million in grants for local police departments and houses of worship in response to an uptick in reported antisemitic attacks and hate crimes against Palestinians in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.

The state will also begin a review of the antisemitism and anti-discrimination policies in New York City’s public university system, while the State Police will expand its monitoring of social media to identify online threats on college campuses.

“You can vigorously oppose Israel’s response following the attack on their people, but still be vigorously opposed to terrorism, Hamas, antisemitism and hate in all of its forms,” Ms. Hochul, a Democrat, said in remarks that were streamed online. “We cannot allow any New Yorker to live in fear.”

The governor’s remarks came as a rash of threats, vandalism and attacks against Jews and Muslims, in New York and across the nation, has permeated headlines. The New York Police Department unveiled statistics last week that showed a spike in hate crimes in the city, especially against Jews, after the Hamas attacks on Israel earlier this month, despite an overall decrease in hate crimes this year.

There were 51 hate crimes in the third week of October, compared with just seven in the same week last year; 30 were antisemitic, the police said. There were four attacks against Palestinians in the same seven-day stretch, compared with two in the same week last year.

Over the weekend, a series of posts on a student website threatened violence against Jewish students at Cornell University, in Ithaca, N.Y. The posts, which urged people to kill Jews on campus, were referred to the F.B.I. as a potential hate crime and prompted the school and the State Police to increase security at the school’s Jewish center.

On Tuesday, the governor — who visited the university on Monday to condemn the posts as antisemitic — announced that “a person of interest” had been arrested by the State Police and would be questioned in connection to the threats.

Later in the day, federal prosecutors in the Northern District of New York said they had arrested Patrick Dai, a 21-year-old Cornell junior originally from Pittsford, N.Y., on a criminal complaint in connection with the threats. Mr. Dai was charged with posting threats to kill or injure another using interstate communications, prosecutors said. He was expected to make an initial court appearance in Syracuse on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear whether he had a lawyer.

Ms. Hochul announced $50 million in grants to help local law enforcement agencies prevent and solve hate crimes. Another $25 million would be made available to beef up security at houses of worships, community centers and other sites.

As the war continues to divide Democrats, Ms. Hochul has aligned herself as a steadfast supporter of Israel. She has vocally defended the country’s military response in Gaza in the wake of the Hamas terrorist attacks and visited Israel earlier this month on a “solidarity mission” as the leader of the state with the largest Jewish population outside of Israel.

On Tuesday, Ms. Hochul also denounced the opponents of Israel’s attacks on Gaza who were taking down street fliers displaying the faces of Israelis kidnapped by Hamas fighters.

“This cruelty by New Yorkers against New Yorkers must stop,” she said.

The new review of anti-discrimination policies at the City University of New York comes after months of unrest among some students and alumni who have accused the public university system of harboring anti-Israel bias. A commencement speech by a law student who denounced “Israeli settler colonialism” became a high-profile flashpoint last summer, prompting criticism from Mayor Eric Adams, among others.

The review will be spearheaded by Jonathan Lippman, the state’s former chief judge."
332,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/opinion/columnists/israel-gaza-hamas-misinformation.html,"Moshe Lavi, whose relatives have been taken hostage by Hamas, recently talked to a group of New York Times journalists about his family’s agony.

His pained voice turned to anger when he recounted encountering disbelief that Hamas committed terrible atrocities when it attacked Israel. Lavi seemed especially bewildered by people “arguing over the semantics” of whether people were beheaded or their heads fell off or even whether there were hostages in Gaza.

In one particularly gruesome twist, there’s been an uproar over whether Hamas had beheaded babies — an unverified claim that President Biden repeated before the White House walked it back and has been subject to much discussion since.

Indeed, since Hamas did murder children and take others as hostages, should it get credit if it didn’t also behead them? It’s an appalling thought.

Some of this skepticism is surely the result of antisemitism. But that’s not all that’s going on.

One key reason for some of the incidents of doubt is the suspicion that horrendous but false or exaggerated claims are being used as a rationale for war — and there are many such historical examples, most notably the Iraq war.

Recently, a former permanent representative of Israel to the United Nations told Britain’s Sky News that he was “very puzzled by the constant concern which the world,” he said, “is showing for the Palestinian people.” He cited U.S. actions after Sept. 11 as a model for what Israel should do in response to Hamas’s shocking massacre of civilians on Oct. 7, which many have called Israel’s Sept. 11.

But if the U.S. response after Sept. 11 is a model, it is as a model of what not to do.

After the attacks, the United States received deep global sympathy. Many Muslims around the world were furious about this blemish upon Islam, even if they opposed U.S. policies: Citizens held vigils, politicians condemned the attacks, and clerics repudiated them in mosque sermons. (The idea that Muslims widely celebrated the attacks has been repeatedly shown to be false or traces back to a few instances of dubious clarity.)

But instead of mobilizing that widespread global sympathy to try to isolate the extremists, the United States chose to wage a reckless and destructive war in Iraq, driven by an impulsive desire for vengeance and justified by falsehoods about weapons of mass destruction.

The Bush administration’s lies in the lead-up to the war, the fiasco of its occupation and the chaos, violence and death that the invasion set off have deeply and indelibly damaged the standing and credibility of the United States and its allies.

People in the region were seared by images of Iraqi institutions — hospitals, ministries, museums — being looted while the U.S. military did little, of families shot as they returned home from a hospital or at checkpoints as they missed a hand signal or instructions shouted in English, of the torture and sadism at Abu Ghraib.

People also saw how occupation policies, like the quick and thoughtless disbanding of the Iraqi Army, contributed to the creation of ISIS a decade later.

In the Middle East, the devastating aftermath of that war — justified by false claims — has never ended.

To make matters worse, the Israeli government has a long history of making false claims and denying responsibility for atrocities that later proved to be its doing.

In one example of many, in 2014, four boys younger than 13 were killed by Israeli airstrikes while playing by themselves at a beach — three of them hit by a second blast while desperately fleeing the initial blast.

There was first a concerted effort among some pro-Israel social media activists to claim the explosions were due to a Hamas rocket misfiring. The Israeli military initially claimed that “the target of this strike was Hamas terrorist operatives.” However, the beach was near a hotel housing journalists for Western outlets, including at least one from The New York Times, who witnessed the killings. The Guardian reported that journalists who visited the area in the aftermath saw no weapons or equipment and that kids regularly played there.

Israel then investigated and exonerated itself. Peter Lerner, a spokesman at the time for the Israel Defense Forces, said that it had targeted a “compound belonging to Hamas’s Naval Police and Naval Force (including naval commandos) and which was utilized exclusively by militants.”

But The Telegraph, whose correspondent also witnessed the killings, reported that some of the journalists who had seen the bombing said there had been “no attempt to interview them.”

One can see how this history plays out in the global upheaval over the Hamas claim two weeks ago that an Israeli missile struck a hospital courtyard in Gaza. Israeli and American officials denied this and asserted that the missile came from within Gaza. There were also initial claims that 500 people were killed in the hospital blast, leading to headlines and global condemnations. Then the number was challenged, leading to another round of uproar and back-and-forth.

It is certainly possible that the hospital may have been accidentally hit by a missile fired in Gaza — such misfires have happened. But Israel’s bombardment has also caused large civilian casualties. The evidence isn’t conclusive either way, and the truth remains unknown.

Yet to a family that lost members in the hospital blast — which U.S. officials estimate killed hundreds — that squabble over exact numbers might seem as cruel as the skepticism about the atrocities committed by Hamas to an Israeli family that suffered during the Oct. 7 attack.

But there’s still the fact that fabricating or exaggerating atrocities is done to influence the calculus of what the public will accept — including what costs are justified to impose on civilians.

In 1990, after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, there was widespread resistance in the United States to the idea of a new war — the country had not shaken Vietnam syndrome, that it was best for the United States to avoid large foreign military entanglements, for both practical and moral reasons.

It was in this context that a teenager testified before Congress in 1990 that she had seen Iraqi soldiers take premature babies out of incubators and leave them to die on the cold floor — a shocking assertion repeated by many high-level officials. The claim was widely repeated by officials and the media and even by Amnesty International.

Kept secret was the fact that the witness was the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States and her false testimony had most likely been organized by a public relations firm working for the Kuwaiti government.

The shocking fabrication played a key role in the effort to sell the war to the reluctant American public. Needing to make sure oil fields stayed in the hands of the rulers of a tiny country created by colonial powers in the early 20th century went only so far. Opposing an army so savage that it commits the most unthinkable crimes is a more convincing appeal for war.

The terrible outcome of all this history is widespread distrust and dehumanization, as ordinary people’s loss and pain are viewed suspiciously as a potential cudgel that will cause further loss and pain for others.

Even people who I know have no sympathies toward Hamas or any kind of terrorism roll their eyes at some of the recent accounts of atrocities. “We always hear of something terrible when they want to go to war — how convenient,” one acquaintance told me recently.

There are plenty of echoes of this on social media. “Hamas beheaded babies, Saddam had WMD and I’m the last unicorn,” one person posted on X. Another one said, “The ‘40 babies beheaded by Hamas’ lie is equivalent to the WMD’s lie.”

Such sentiments are widespread.

All this highlights the importance of voices capable of retaining trust and consistent concern for all victims.

I was heartened to see that Human Rights Watch independently verified some of the videos of the horror on Oct. 7 and called the attacks deliberate killings. Similarly, Amnesty International’s independent investigation led the group to condemn the attacks as “cruel and brutal crimes including mass summary killings, hostage-taking.” Both organizations have called for the attacks to be investigated as war crimes.

Both organizations also have a history of documenting Israeli wrongdoings, including its treatment of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, and both organizations have been vilified for doing so, especially by the government of Israel and some NGOs and lawmakers.

Yet these are the kinds of independent voices that need to be heard. In a context where many in the region and world already see the United States as reflexively supporting Israel, no matter its conduct, Mr. Biden might consider elevating such independent human rights voices rather than embracing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

As Amnesty International states, kidnapping civilians is a war crime, and the hostages should be released, unharmed. And their families shouldn’t have to endure this suspicion on top of their pain.

But to credibly demand that war crimes be stopped and lives respected requires equal concern extended to all victims, including the two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

The victims are real — all of them — and that’s where all efforts to rebuild credibility or to seek a solution must begin."

Over the past year, the hackers struck at countries including Israel, Saudi Arabia and Jordan in a monthslong campaign linked to Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security, according to a new report by the company, Check Point.

The Iranian hackers appeared to gain access to emails from an array of targets, including government staff members, militaries, telecommunications companies and financial organizations, the report said.

The malware used to infiltrate the computers also appeared to map out the networks the hackers had broken into, providing Iran with a blueprint of foreign cyberinfrastructure that could prove helpful for planning and executing future attacks."
336,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/opinion/princeton-columbia-israel-gaza.html,"The conflict in Israel and Palestine has thrown American campuses and society into turmoil.

We are both deans of public policy schools. One of us comes from a Palestinian family displaced by war. The other served in Israeli military intelligence before a long career in academia. Our life stories converged when we were colleagues and friends for 10 years on the faculty of Princeton University. Notwithstanding our different backgrounds, we are both alarmed by the climate on campuses and the polarizing and dehumanizing language visible throughout society.

Universities should state hard truths and clarify critical issues. As leaders of public policy schools, we train the leaders of tomorrow to think creatively and boldly. It starts with countering speech that is harmful; modeling civic dialogue, mutual respect and empathy; and showing an ability to listen to one another.

Universities should not retreat into their ivory towers because the discourse has gotten toxic; on the contrary, the discourse will get more toxic if universities pull back.

Faculty and students on some campuses across the country have reported feeling unsafe in light of verbal and physical attacks. Activist groups and even student groups are screaming past one another instead of listening and engaging with the other side. The polarizing talk in media, political and campus circles creates an environment lacking in sophistication and nuance.

For example, chants like “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” are commonly perceived as calls for the annihilation of the state of Israel. What’s more, the position these chants represent completely ignores the fact that a majority of Palestinians have rejected this stance since the 1993 Oslo Accords and leaders of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank have consistently called for a two-state solution. Furthermore, the claim that all Palestinians in Gaza are responsible for Hamas lacks empirical support.

Condemnation of the Oct. 7 massacre of Israeli civilians by Hamas — and calling it out as an act of terrorism — shouldn’t be avoided out of risk of offending Palestinians and their supporters. Not condemning the terrorist attacks is a failure of a moral core, and by no means should condemnation of terrorism be viewed as incompatible with believing in Palestinian rights and statehood, alongside Israel. Terrorism is, by common understanding, an attack on all humanity.

We teach our students to deal with policy predicaments that start with tough questions that require understanding opposing ideas. The uncertainty about what the future of Gaza will look like, whether the peace process can be revived and how the security and safety of Israelis and Palestinians will be achieved — these are, to be sure, hard questions with solutions that do not fit on placards.

While campus groups and all Americans enjoy freedom of speech, educators at universities must respond to speech that is harmful, hateful, untrue or lacking nuance and historical context. Free speech works only when there is vigorous counterspeech.

As deans, we also know that in this volatile political environment, we must ensure that our campuses have places where each side can air their opinions and even come together and hold difficult conversations without fear of retaliation. Examples of this include webinars that our respective schools held in the wake of the attacks, featuring a diversity of voices, including academics and policymakers, Israelis and Palestinians, Democrats and Republicans. That must start with the core element of civic engagement and civil disagreement.

Campuses must protect free speech and equally advocate mutually respectful dialogue. That obligation is both especially important and especially demanding in our current political and societal landscape.

A discussion of the actions that states should take in self-defense is worth convening, as well as one on the conduct of warfare in a dense urban environment. Israel’s response should be directed at eliminating the threat posed by Hamas, not at innocent civilians in Gaza. What that means in practice is a matter for debate. Calling out Israel for its bombing of civilian areas in Gaza shouldn’t be avoided out of risk of offending Israelis and their supporters.

There is no better place for these discussions than a university campus. But sponsoring this kind of debate takes courage.

As educators, we at times have to make our students uncomfortable by challenging their preconceptions and encouraging them to think through their positions using data, evidence and logic. It is unrealistic to believe that individuals can put their emotions away. But if a university doesn’t encourage students to reflect on how their own emotions shape, and occasionally distort, their analysis of the world around them, where else could they possibly learn this?

Even before the current violence, the Arab-Israeli conflict was an intensely uncomfortable topic to discuss, and unfortunately, some schools may try to solve that problem by omitting it from their curriculums. Journal editors may be wary of wading into such hotly charged topics. This gap has left an intellectual vacuum filled by hate speech, antisemitism, Islamophobia and other stereotypical tropes on campuses and crowded out rigorous empirical analysis and reasoned discussions. Add to that a polarized media establishment, political landscape and social media, and no wonder we’ve seen the conversation on campus devolve into a verbal war of platitudes and talking points.

We remain hopeful, however. Over the past few weeks, we’ve also witnessed a vibrant student body eager for more information around these issues.

Universities play a vital role in shaping the conversation. Polls show that universities still enjoy a higher level of trust by the public than many other institutions, although it is dwindling. We have unique access to the world’s best intellectual minds and financial resources to support them.

We will squander this trust and legacy if we stay on the sidelines."
337,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/world/middleeast/cornell-jewish-threats.html,"Campus police at Cornell University, in Ithaca, N.Y., were guarding the university’s Center for Jewish Living on Sunday after online posts threatened violence against Jewish students, according to a statement by the Cornell president, Martha E. Pollack.

The posts, which appeared on an online discussion forum about fraternities, included threats to shoot Jewish students and encouragement to others to kill them. They also called for the Jewish center, where a number of students live and which offers a kosher dining room, to be torn down.

“We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,” said Ms. Pollack. “Threats of violence are absolutely intolerable, and we will work to ensure that the person or people who posted them are punished to the full extent of the law.”

Campus police referred the threats to the F.B.I. as a potential hate crime, said Ms. Pollack, who visited the center on Sunday evening, according to a statement from the university. The threats were posted on Greekrank, a website for students to discuss fraternities and sororities at various colleges, according to The Cornell Daily Sun, the student newspaper at Cornell. The posts have been removed from the site, but the student newspaper published screenshots of several virulent threats.

“We hear that as a call for our genocide,” said Rabbi Ari Weiss, the executive director of Cornell Hillel, a Jewish group on campus. “Students are scared. They’re concerned for their safety.”

The postings came as the Israel Defense Forces pushed into Gaza in a war against the armed group Hamas, which is embedded within the civilian population in the Palestinian enclave and which launched terrorist attacks against Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,400 people and taking more than 200 hostages. In the weeks since, as Palestinian deaths in Gaza have risen into the thousands under Israel airstrikes, tensions have sharpened at college campuses across the United States.

The atmosphere at Cornell grew especially taut when Russell Rickford, an associate professor in the university’s history department who specializes in African-American political culture, gave a speech in downtown Ithaca on Oct. 15 in which he said he found the attack on Israel by Hamas to be “exhilarating.” He later apologized and requested a leave of absence from the university.

Campus groups have held at least a handful of events related to the conflict. Jewish students held two vigils, one in response to the attack, and a second to highlight the Israeli hostages taken by Hamas, according to Rabbi Weiss. Palestinian students and their supporters have held several demonstrations.

Last Wednesday, students woke to find graffiti on sidewalks across campus that insulted Israel and compared Zionism to genocide, The Cornell Daily Sun reported."
338,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/world/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-gaza-politics.html,"Follow live updates on the Israel-Hamas war and Gaza.

The social media post went up online at 1:10 a.m. Sunday, while most Israelis were sleeping.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had a message: His military and security chiefs, he said, had failed to provide him with any warning of the surprise Hamas assault on Oct. 7. He appeared to be placing all the blame on them for the colossal lapses — even as Israeli forces were broadening a risky ground war in Gaza.

The country awoke to a furious response, including from within Mr. Netanyahu’s own war cabinet. The post on X, formerly Twitter, was deleted, and the Israeli leader apologized in a new one. “I was wrong,” he said.

But the damage was done.

For many Israelis, the episode confirmed suspicions of rifts and disarray at the top during one of the worst crises in the country’s 75-year history and reinforced qualms about Mr. Netanyahu’s leadership.

“He’s in survival mode,” said Gadi Wolfsfeld, an expert in political communications at Reichman University in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv.

“He’s been in difficult circumstances before, and he still believes he can come out of this and continue to be prime minister when this is all done,” Professor Wolfsfeld said, adding, “The only thing driving him is staying in power.”

Among the first to call out Mr. Netanyahu’s middle-of-the night comments was Benny Gantz, the centrist former defense minister and military chief who, for the sake of national unity, left the ranks of the parliamentary opposition to join Mr. Netanyahu’s emergency war cabinet in the days after the massacre by Hamas. At least 1,400 people were killed in those attacks — it was the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust — and at least 239 were taken as hostages to Gaza."
339,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/world/middleeast/gaza-blackout-internet-israel.html,"For 34 hours, the vast majority of the more than two million Palestinians who live in Gaza had no way to reach the outside world, or one another.

They had no way to know whether their loved ones were alive or dead. Emergency phone lines stopped ringing. Desperate paramedics tried to save people by driving toward the sound of explosions. Wounded people were left to die in the street.

On Friday at sunset, three weeks into Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza — and as Palestinians braced themselves for an impending Israeli ground invasion — the weak phone and internet service that had allowed some semblance of life to continue inside the blockaded enclave was suddenly severed. Two American officials said the United States believed Israel was responsible for the communications loss, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

Panic rippled through the territory.

“I felt that I had become blind and deaf, unable to see or hear,” Fathi Sabbah, a journalist based in Gaza, wrote on his Facebook profile on Sunday, after phone and internet service partly returned.

Since gunmen from Hamas — the armed group that rules Gaza — burst through the border fence on Oct. 7, killing around 1,400 people in southern Israel and taking more than 220 more hostage, according to Israeli authorities, Gazans say they have been living inside of a nightmare. In response to the attacks, the Israeli military declared a siege of the densely populated territory, cutting off electricity, water and medical supplies as it rained down a relentless barrage of aerial and artillery bombardments.

On Sunday, the Israeli military said that it had expanded a ground incursion overnight, and warned with increasing “urgency” that Palestinian civilians should move to the southern part of the coastal strip — although airstrikes have continued to kill people there, too.

The Israeli military also said that it was conducting airstrikes in Lebanon after at least 16 rockets were launched from there into Israeli territory. In Gaza, 47 aid trucks crossed the border from Egypt carrying water, food and medicine — the most in a single day since trucks were first allowed in on Oct. 21, but still insufficient compared to the levels of assistance that aid organizations say are needed."
340,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/business/economy/middle-east-war-oil-prices-world-bank.html,"A major escalation of the war between Israel and Hamas — one that spilled over into a broader Middle East conflict — could send oil prices surging as much as 75 percent, the World Bank warned on Monday.

The potential for a global energy shock in the wake of Hamas’s brutal attack on Israel has been a pressing question for economists and policymakers, who have spent the past year trying to combat inflation.

Energy prices have remained largely contained since Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7. But economists and policymakers have been closely monitoring the trajectory of the war and studying previous conflicts in the region as they try to determine the potential scale of economic repercussions if the current conflict intensifies and broadens across the Middle East.

The World Bank’s new study suggests that such a crisis could overlap with energy market disruptions already caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine, exacerbating the economic consequences.

“The latest conflict in the Middle East comes on the heels of the biggest shock to commodity markets since the 1970s — Russia’s war with Ukraine,” Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s chief economist and senior vice president for development economics, said in a statement that accompanied the report. “If the conflict were to escalate, the global economy would face a dual energy shock for the first time in decades — not just from the war in Ukraine but also from the Middle East.”

The World Bank projects that global oil prices, which are currently hovering around $85 per barrel, will average $90 per barrel this quarter. The organization had been projecting them to decline next year, but disruptions to oil supplies could drastically change those forecasts.

The bank’s worst-case scenario is pegged to the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which took place during the Arab-Israeli war. A disruption of that severity could remove as much as eight millions barrels of oil per day off the market and send prices as high as $157 per barrel.

A less severe, but still disruptive, outcome would be if the war played out like the 2003 war in Iraq, with oil supply being reduced by five million barrels per day and prices rising as much as 35 percent, to $121 a barrel.

A more modest outcome would be if the conflict paralleled the 2011 civil war in Libya, with two million barrels per day of oil lost from global markets and prices rising as much as 13 percent, to $102 per barrel.

World Bank officials cautioned that the effects on inflation and the global economy would depend on the duration of the conflict and how long oil prices remained elevated. They said that if higher oil prices were sustained, however, that would lead to higher prices for food, industrial metals and gold.

The United States and Europe have been trying to keep global oil prices from spiking in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Western nations introduced a price cap on Russia’s energy exports, a move aimed at limiting Moscow’s oil revenues while ensuring oil supply continued to flow.

The Biden administration also tapped the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ease oil price pressures. A senior administration official told The New York Times last week that President Biden could authorize a new round of releases from the reserve, an emergency stockpile of crude oil that is stored in underground salt caverns near the Gulf of Mexico.

Biden administration officials have publicly downplayed their concerns about the economic impact of the conflict, saying it was too soon to predict the fallout. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen noted at a Bloomberg News event last week that oil prices had so far been generally flat and that she had not yet seen signs that the war was having global economic consequences.

“What could happen if the war expands?” Ms. Yellen said. “Of course there could be more meaningful consequences.”"
341,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/world/middleeast/netanyahu-apologizes-hamas-attack.html,"The rifts and disarray among Israel’s top leaders erupted into the open on Sunday when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to blame the military and security establishment for the failures that led to the surprise Hamas assault on Oct. 7 — even as Israeli forces were broadening their ground war in Gaza.

The comments by Mr. Netanyahu on X, formerly Twitter, prompted a furious response, including from within his own war cabinet. The post was deleted, and the Israeli leader apologized in a new post, saying: “I was wrong.”

At least 1,400 people were killed in the Hamas attacks, the deadliest day for Israel in its 75-year history, and more than 220 people were taken as hostages to Gaza.

Although many senior officials, including military and security chiefs and the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, have accepted some responsibility for Israel being caught so off-guard, Mr. Netanyahu has declined to do so. He has said several times, most recently at a news conference on Saturday evening, that after the war tough questions would be asked of everybody, including himself. Mr. Netanyahu has been in power for 14 of the past 16 years.

Mr. Netanyahu’s refusal to publicly accept blame has further shaken confidence in his leadership, which had fallen even before the war, in part because of his efforts to push through a judicial overhaul that sparked huge nationwide protests. Opinion surveys since Oct. 7 have indicated overwhelming public trust in the military and plummeting faith in government officials.

The news conference on Saturday was an attempt by the government to show unity: Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Gallant and Mr. Gantz appeared alongside one another, and the prime minister answered questions from reporters for the first time since Oct. 7.

Many of the questions focused on responsibility for the Hamas attack. Hours afterward, Mr. Netanyahu sought to deflect blame from himself, instead directing it at the security establishment — and specifically the heads of military intelligence and the Shin Bet internal security agency.

“Under no circumstances and at no stage was Prime Minister Netanyahu warned of war intentions on the part of Hamas,” his post read. “On the contrary, the assessment of the entire security echelon, including the head of military intelligence and the head of Shin Bet, was that Hamas was deterred and was seeking an arrangement.”

“This was the assessment presented time and again to the prime minister and the cabinet by all the security echelon and the intelligence community, including right up until the outbreak of the war,” it added.

Mr. Gantz responded with a sharp post expressing his full support for the military and the Shin Bet, which is playing a key role in the war, and urging Mr. Netanyahu to retract his statement.

“When we are at war, leadership means displaying responsibility, deciding to do the right things and strengthening the forces so that they will be able to carry out what we are demanding of them,” Mr. Gantz wrote.

The centrist leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, said Mr. Netanyahu had “crossed a red line.” Another former military chief, Gabi Ashkenazi, told Mr. Netanyahu to remove his post, adding, “We are at war.”

Following the backlash, Mr. Netanyahu’s post was removed. In a new post late Sunday morning, showing an unusual level of contrition, he wrote: “I was wrong. Things I said following the news conference should not have been said and I apologize for that.”

Expressing his support for the security branch heads, the military chief of staff and commanders and soldiers in the field, he added: “Together we will win.”"
342,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/world/middleeast/dagestan-airport-russia-israel-mob.html,"A mob stormed an airport in southern Russia where a commercial flight from Tel Aviv had arrived on Sunday night, according to Russian state media and videos posted from the scene. The episode followed several anti-Israel protests in the region that could signal a new point of friction for the Kremlin as it wages a war in Ukraine.

The Russian authorities announced that the airport where the mob had formed, in Makhachkala, the capital of the predominantly Muslim Dagestan region, was temporarily closed and riot police were dispatched to the scene. Dozens of people were arrested and 20 people were injured, including police officers, officials said later.

The Israeli government said in a statement that it was following the events closely and expected the Russian authorities to protect all Israeli citizens and Jews, and to act firmly against the rioters and against what it described as “the wild incitement directed at Jews and Israelis.”

President Vladimir V. Putin has listed interethnic and interreligious accord in Russia as a main policy priority. Anti-Israel and antisemitic protests in the North Caucasus, a region where Mr. Putin fought his first war as Russian leader, could jeopardize that at a time when the Kremlin is also waging a long and bloody war in Ukraine.

It was not immediately clear exactly what had taken place at the airport, as unverified videos of the chaotic scene spread across social media. Some people in the videos held Palestinian flags and carried signs opposing the war in Gaza, and some chanted “Allahu akbar,” Arabic for “God is great.”

RIA Novosti, a Russian state news agency, posted a video of what it said were law enforcement officers assembling on the airport’s tarmac.

In one video verified by The New York Times, a group of dozens of men, some carrying Palestinian flags, swarms a parked airplane from the carrier Red Wings. “There are no passengers here anymore,” a man in a yellow safety vest tells the rioters, pointing at the plane. He adds, “I am Muslim.”

In another video verified by The Times, filmed from inside an airplane on a tarmac, a crew member can be heard announcing: “Please stay seated and don’t try to open the plane’s door. There is an angry mob outside.”

The regional police said in a statement that they had identified 150 people as having actively taken part in the riot, and that 60 had been arrested. Nine police officers were injured in the clashes, two of whom were hospitalized, according to the statement.

Dagestan’s health care ministry said 20 people in total had been injured, including police officers and civilians. Ten people were hospitalized, two of whom were in grave condition, it said. The police said that local investigators had opened a criminal probe into the riot, and promised that everyone who had participated would be held responsible.

The Russian aviation authorities said on Sunday that the airport “has been cleared of unauthorized entry by citizens.” The government of Dagestan said the situation was “under control.”

Sergei Melikov, the head of Dagestan, condemned the rioters, saying that “there was no honor in swearing at strangers, reaching into their pockets and trying to check their passport,” referring to reports that some protesters had asked passers-by at the airport to prove their nationality.

There were also reports of anti-Israel protests across the North Caucasus, a combustible region in the Russian south. On Saturday, dozens of people gathered in front of a hotel in the town of Khasavyurt, in Dagestan, after reports on social media claimed that it was “full of Jews.” About 200 people also gathered in the central square of Cherkessk, the capital of the Karachay-Cherkessia republic, to protest the potential arrival of Israeli refugees, local news media reported.

The local authorities in Dagestan blamed “extremist” outlets administered by “Russian enemies” for inciting the unrest. Some of the protests were supported by a Telegram channel linked to a former Russian lawmaker, Ilya Ponomaryov, who had fled to Ukraine and has become a staunchly anti-Kremlin politician. Plans to “catch” the passengers of the incoming flight were shared in the Telegram channel, along with screenshots of the flight schedule, on Saturday and Sunday. Local religious figures in the North Caucasus have condemned the protests.

Russia has gone to extraordinary lengths to crack down on protests over its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which it falsely claimed was being fought to rid the country of “Nazis.”

Ukrainian officials were quick to seize on the events in Russia as reflecting a deeper culture of hatred that the Kremlin had fomented for years.

“For Russian propaganda talking heads on official television, hate rhetoric is routine,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement, noting the “appalling videos” coming out of Dagestan. “Hatred is what drives aggression and terror. We must all work together to oppose hatred.”

Who knows if anyone will bury us,” he said. “These feelings reflect the state of fear and defeat and despair caused by Israel’s barbaric airstrikes.”

On Oct. 13, Israel warned more than a million Palestinians to evacuate their homes in northern Gaza and move south. But those who fled found that the south, too, was perilous as Israel kept up airstrikes on the area.

On the first day of the war, Ms. Kurd said, she fled her home in the northern section of Gaza City and went to stay with family in another part of the city for four days. But the airstrikes hit around them.

They went to Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City where for three days, she stayed with her husband and four children in the hallway. From a window, she said, she watched a constant stream of dead and wounded being rushed into the hospital.

A week ago, the family went to Khan Younis, where Israeli airstrikes continued to rain down.

“They say: ‘Go to a safe place.’ But then they strike the place they told us to flee to,” Ms. Kurd said. “This is intentional. There’s no mercy and it’s massacre after massacre and the world is just watching it happen.”

When they hear Israeli fighter jets overhead, some utter the Muslim proclamation of faith and give their loved ones around them what could be a farewell kiss. Children have taken to writing their names on their hands or arms, so if they are killed, their bodies will be identified and not buried in the mass graves for unidentified bodies.

Other people have posted last testaments on social media, seeking to settle any debts or unresolved disputes and asking people for forgiveness to clean the slate in case they die.

This week the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, said the “appalling attacks by Hamas” on Israel could not justify “collective punishment of the Palestinian people,” adding that he was concerned about clear violations of international humanitarian law."
344,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/nyregion/palestine-protest-brooklyn-barclays-center-nyc.html,"Crowds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators packed the streets of Brooklyn on Saturday as they called on the U.S. government to stop sending aid to Israel.

The march was organized by the Palestinian-led community group Within Our Lifetime, and participants stretched for several blocks as they traveled from the Brooklyn Museum to the Brooklyn Bridge, chanting “Free, free Palestine!”

The demonstration was the latest in a string of protests around New York City since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7. Saturday’s march took place a day after Israeli forces began what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel called “the second stage of the war.”

Waving a Palestinian flag as she marched, Alaa Essafi said that after Israel’s escalated attacks, it felt especially important that she travel from her home in New Jersey to support her “brothers and sisters in Palestine.”

“Together we will send a message,” Ms. Essafi, 21, said.

The museum has a large outdoor plaza, and it has been the site of several large-scale gatherings, including a Black Lives Matter demonstration in 2020 that drew more than 15,000 people."
345,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/opinion/american-muslims-islamaphobia-war.html,"When President Biden landed in Tel Aviv days after Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre of more than 1,400 people, he told an audience of Israelis that this was not just Israel’s Sept. 11, that “it was like 15 9/11s.”

The comparison, which emerged widely and immediately, seemed apt on the surface: a brutal attack that shocked a nation and changed the course of its history. Indeed, it’s been dizzying to witness the speed at which the same patterns we saw after Sept. 11, 2001, are playing out. The mourning of a terrorist attack has been interrupted by the swift bombardment of civilian neighborhoods. American officials, pundits and companies have quickly rallied around Israel in its war on Gaza, which has rapidly intensified by the day. In the first week of the war, Israel dropped more bombs on Gaza than the United States did on Afghanistan in a year. Civilian casualties in Gaza have climbed exponentially. And in the West Bank, recent images of Palestinians being tied, blindfolded, stripped and allegedly subjected to attempted sexual assault by Israeli soldiers and settlers recall Abu Ghraib.

In the United States, it’s as if the country has turned back the clock two decades, but not in the way that Mr. Biden suggests. For those who experienced waves of harassment and government surveillance in the years after Sept. 11, the president’s pledge of “unwavering” support for Israel set off alarm bells. I’ve been speaking with lawyers, community groups and advocacy organizations that worked closely with Muslims after September 2001 about what they’re seeing. Not since that time — not even after the election of Donald Trump, who signed an executive order banning visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries within days of taking office — have I heard so many Muslim and Arab community members say they feel isolated. After living through and reckoning with the devastating aftermath of the war on terrorism, it seems the lessons of Sept. 11 have been forgotten.

There seems to be a sense of both resignation — we’ve been here before — and shock — but we’ve been here before.

In the wake of Sept. 11, the U.S. government activated the full force of the national security and law enforcement apparatus to prevent another terrorist attack on American soil. And it bore down on one particular group: Muslims in America. Mass arrests and a national registry of immigrant Muslims led to the deportation of thousands. F.B.I. and police informants, sent to monitor mosques and Muslim neighborhoods, were later found to have been overzealous and accused of entrapping people who committed no violent crimes. The government’s focus on potentially dangerous Muslims spread to American media and society. According to F.B.I. data, hate crimes against Muslims spiked in 2001. Though that pattern slowed in later years — assaults skyrocketed again in 2015 and 2016 — rates have never dipped back to their pre-2001 numbers.

Today, many Muslims in the United States fear a new outbreak of violence. Days after the attacks in Israel, the Biden administration announced that local and federal law enforcement officers across the United States are “closely monitoring” for connected threats. Within a week of Oct. 7, scattered reports were made to the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee of F.B.I. visits to mosques, and women in hijabs were reportedly being assaulted in several cities.

Though communities were braced for what was to come, no one could have predicted that the first hate crime would be the killing of a 6-year-old Palestinian Muslim boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, whose mother was rushed to the hospital after also being repeatedly stabbed. Joseph Czuba, their landlord, was charged in the killing. (He has pleaded not guilty.) According to the boy’s mother, Mr. Czuba had become violent after the news of Oct. 7 and yelled, “You Muslims must die,” before stabbing Wadea 26 times. While speaking at Wadea’s funeral, one religious leader, Imam Omar Suleiman, wondered in his remarks: “Have we not learned anything from 9/11? Do we really want to live those dark years again?”

Perhaps because those “dark years” were not so long ago, attacks like the one on Wadea feel as though they are opening a barely closed wound. One Illinois resident told me that community members are now planning patrols for their children, not dissimilar to those started by some mosques after Mr. Trump was elected. “This is exactly what we were afraid of,” Abed Ayoub, the director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, told me recently.

What happened to the Muslim community in the United States after Sept. 11 — the surveillance, the targeting, the fear — was intimately tied to many Americans’ belief in the righteousness of what our government was doing abroad. As the United States invaded first Afghanistan and then Iraq, both wars that wrought devastating civilian casualties and paved the way for political chaos, the public perception of Muslims in America plummeted to new lows. Within a year of the Iraq invasion, a Pew poll found that a larger number of Americans believed Islam was more likely than other religions to encourage violence. By 2014, Muslims ranked lowest in another Pew poll of how the American public views different religious groups.

That unfounded perception has remained in the years since. The sudden arrival of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria only deepened the suspicion of Muslims in America as an ever-present threat. Once again, Islam appeared in close connection to terrorism in the American imagination as images of masked figures carrying out gruesome executions reinforced twisted stereotypes of Muslims. The ISIS phenomenon of the Western recruit meant that any wayward Muslim teenager could be a threat and that even the most assimilated people had the potential to become terrorists.

Since the Israel-Hamas war started, these long-held suspicions now appear to be seeping into the public debate again over showing support for Palestinians in Gaza, more than 8,000 of whom have been killed since the bombardment began, according to the Gazan health ministry. The false connection between supporting civilians in Gaza and the terrorist activities of Hamas is manifesting across our country’s public institutions. From college campuses to places of work, people are facing retribution for expressing support for Palestinians that is being misconstrued as anti-Israel or pro-Hamas. Companies have rescinded job offers, journalists have been fired for sharing posts, and students whose organizations have signed statements have been smeared publicly. The scale of suppression of speech by social media platforms, such as the shadow banning of Gaza-related posts and the blocking of accounts on Instagram, has been alarming enough that Human Rights Watch has started to document it.

Perhaps the Sept. 11 comparison and the good-guy/bad-guy binary can be evoked successfully because there has been almost no accountability for the failures of the war on terrorism. The oversimplification is made worse by Mr. Biden, who, in the same visit to Tel Aviv during which he cautioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to avoid the “mistakes” America made after Sept. 11, he also referred to Palestinians as “the other team.” There is no call from Israel to win the “hearts and minds” of Palestinians, as George W. Bush claimed to do with Iraqis; there is no call to bring freedom to Gaza, as the United States said it wanted to do in Afghanistan. Instead, Mr. Biden has not publicly admonished the Israeli defense minister for saying that his country was fighting “human animals.” And at home, he and other leaders have offered little to assuage the growing fears in the Arab and Muslim community: Last week he had a private meeting with Muslim leaders that the administration never publicly announced. Though the White House released a statement the day after Wadea Al-Fayoume’s killing, the president didn’t call the boy’s family until five days later.

The Oct. 7 attacks didn’t happen on American soil, but this is an intimate war for many Americans. Some families wait desperately for scraps of news of their loved ones taken hostage by Hamas. Others search for some sign of their loved ones in Gaza, waiting for the blue checks to show that their WhatsApp messages have been read by family members who are trying to stay alive amid near-constant bombing and a lack of food and water.

The first Friday after Oct. 7, the first holy day for Muslims and Jews since the attacks, New York City and the rest of the country seemed to be on high alert, bracing itself because a former Hamas leader in Qatar had called for protests across Arab nations in support of the Palestinians, a call which was mislabeled as a day of jihad. I decided to visit the Islamic Center at N.Y.U., expecting a tense and nervous congregation. Instead, an imam finished his speech, and the women around me lined up to pray. As we knelt together, all I could hear was sobs.

We’ve been here before, but we don’t have to be here again."

In calls monitored by Israeli intelligence agents, Hamas operatives who talked to one another also gave the sense that they sought to avoid another war with Israel so soon after a damaging two-week conflict in May 2021, according to two of the Israeli officials. Israeli intelligence, they said, is now looking into whether those calls were real or staged.

The next failure was operational.

Two of the officials said that the Israeli border surveillance system was almost entirely reliant on cameras, sensors and machine guns that are operated remotely.

Israeli commanders had grown overly confident in the system’s impregnability. They thought that the combination of remote surveillance and arms, barriers above ground and a subterranean wall to block Hamas from digging tunnels into Israel made mass infiltration unlikely, reducing the need for significant numbers of soldiers to be physically stationed along the border line itself.

With the system in place, the military started reducing the number of troops there, moving them to other areas of concern, including the West Bank, according to Israel Ziv, a retired major general who commanded ground forces in the south for many years, served as the head of the Israel Defense Forces’ Operations Division from 2003 to 2005 and was recently recruited into the reserves again because of the war.

“The thinning of the forces seemed reasonable because of the construction of the fence and the aura they created around it, as if it were invincible, that nothing would be able to pass it,” he said."
347,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/opinion/international-world/gaza-idf-israel-veterans.html,"When my Israeli infantry unit arrived at the first village in Gaza, in July 2014, we cleared houses by sending grenades through windows, blowing doors open and firing bullets into rooms to avoid ambush and booby traps. We were told Palestinian civilians had fled.

I realized this wasn’t true as I stood over the corpse of an elderly Palestinian woman whose face had been mutilated by shrapnel. She had been lying on the sand floor of a shack, in a pool of blood.

That was my experience the last time Israeli troops entered the Gaza Strip in a large-scale way, when my special forces unit, attached to the 993rd Nahal Brigade, was one of the first to go in.

Like the invasion that the Israeli military has said is imminent, that campaign was precipitated by atrocities carried out by Hamas terrorists. On June 12 of that year, Hamas kidnapped and murdered three Israeli teenagers; soon after, Israelis murdered a Palestinian teenager. The horrific exchange escalated into a larger conflict; ultimately some 70 Israelis and 2,250 Palestinians were killed over seven weeks. Then, as now, Israelis were told that we were going in to deal a decisive blow to Hamas."
348,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-attack.html,"Fighting continued into the evening on Saturday in one of the broadest invasions of Israeli territory in 50 years, as Palestinian militants from Gaza fired another round of rockets at Israel’s central heartland, including Tel Aviv, and Israel worked to clear militants from Israeli towns and retaliated with huge strikes on Gazan cities.

It followed an enormous and coordinated early-morning assault on southern Israel, as the militants infiltrated 22 Israeli towns and army bases, kidnapped Israeli civilians and soldiers, and fired thousands of rockets toward cities as far away as Jerusalem.

Panic and disbelief rippled throughout Israel. Many people huddled inside their homes while hearing sirens, explosions and gunshots outside. Gruesome, graphic images flooded social media and spread throughout the world.

By early evening, at least 250 Israelis had been reported dead and more than 1,400 wounded, Israeli officials said, while at least 234 Palestinians were killed and more than 1,600 wounded in either gun battles or airstrikes, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said."
349,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/world/europe/ukraine-war-russia-peace-forum-malta.html,"Dozens of countries met for a second day on Sunday at a forum in Malta intended to rally support for Ukraine and to encourage countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia that have taken a neutral stance in the conflict there not to side with Russia.

Countries sent national security advisers to the Ukraine Peace Forum, the third round of talks based on the country’s proposed 10-point settlement for the war, called the Peace Formula, which calls for a complete withdrawal of Russian forces, an end of hostilities and reparations.

Russia was not invited to the forum, reflecting the lack of appetite from Moscow or Kyiv for peace talks — the idea is anathema to Ukraine while Russian forces occupy part of its territory.

For its part, Moscow considers itself to have annexed five of Ukraine’s regions, and while that decision has been condemned internationally as illegal, Russia would consider retention of that land a prerequisite to any peace settlement.

Even as Ukraine battles to regain territory on the backfield, it is also pursuing an international consensus around its cause, and the forum provided an opportunity to advance its diplomatic position.

It is a “fundamentally important first goal” to rally international support, Pavlo Klimkin, a former Ukrainian foreign minister, said in an interview from the talks, which are being held behind closed doors. Another goal, he said, is “to prevent possible sliding toward Russia.”

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in an overnight speech that 66 countries had attended the forum, which Malta’s foreign ministry said it had organized at Ukraine’s request. Mr. Zelesnky called the turnout a “good result.”

It was not possible to confirm the figure independently, but representatives from Ukraine’s allies including the United States, Britain and European Union countries attended, along with India, Brazil and South Africa.

Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, has dismissed the gathering in Malta without Russian participation as “counterproductive” to a settlement and said it was “a blatantly anti-Russian event.”

The forum came at a difficult moment for the Ukrainian government. The war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas has lowered the profile of the conflict in Ukraine, and a counteroffensive launched by the country in June is yet to achieve its central objectives of retaking substantial territory in the east and south."
350,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/opinion/biden-israel-gaza-2024.html,"There’s a gathering sense that President Biden’s response to the war in Gaza may cost him the 2024 election. A recent Gallup poll showed that his support among Democrats has slipped 11 points in the past month to 75 percent, the lowest of his presidency. On Friday my colleagues in the newsroom reported on a growing backlash against Biden coming from young and left-leaning voters.

Does this mean that standing with Israel could be politically fatal for Biden? I don’t think so, and to understand why, it’s important to understand the core responsibilities of an American president.

In 2012, when I was a partisan supporter of Mitt Romney, there was one message from President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign that I thought made the most succinct and persuasive case for his second term. It was delivered most memorably by then-Vice President Biden, of all people, at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. He said that Obama had “courage in his soul, compassion in his heart and a spine of steel,” and then Biden delivered the key line: “Osama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive.”

While I believed that Romney would do a better job as president than Obama, that sentence affected me so much — not just because it happened to be true but also because it resonated with two of a president’s most vital tasks: preserving prosperity at home and security abroad. A war-weary nation longed for a clear win, and a people still recovering from the Great Recession needed economic stability. The killing of bin Laden was the greatest victory of the war on terrorism, and the preservation of General Motors, an iconic American company, resonated as a national symbol as important as or more important than the number of jobs saved.

Now fast-forward to August 2024, when Biden will speak on his own behalf in Chicago at the next Democratic convention. Will he be able to tell the American people that he did his job? Will he be able to make that claim in the face of international crises more consequential than anything either Obama or Donald Trump faced during their presidencies?

Consider what he confronts: a brutal Russian assault on a liberal democracy in Europe, the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and an aggressive China that is gaining military strength and threatens Taiwan. That’s two hot wars and a new cold war, each against a nation or entity that forsakes any meaningful moral norms, violates international law and commits crimes against humanity.

In each conflict abroad — hot or cold — America is indispensable to the defense of democracy and basic humanity. Ukraine cannot withstand a yearslong Russian onslaught unless the United States acts as the arsenal of democracy, keeping the Ukrainian military supplied with the weapons and munitions it needs. America is Israel’s indispensable ally and close military partner. It depends on our aid and — just as important — our good will for much of its strength and security. And Taiwan is a target of opportunity for China absent the might of the United States Pacific Fleet.

And keep in mind, Biden is managing these conflicts all while trying to make sure that the nation emerges from a pandemic with inflation in retreat and its economy intact. In spite of economic growth and low unemployment numbers that make the American economy the envy of the world, Americans are still dealing with the consequences of inflation and certainly don’t feel optimistic about our economic future.

Biden is now under fire from two sides, making these challenges even more difficult. The populist, Trumpist right threatens his ability to fund Ukraine, hoping to engineer a cutoff in aid that could well lead to the greatest victory for European autocrats since Hitler and then Stalin swallowed European democracies whole in their quest for power and control.

At the same time, progressives calling for a cease-fire in Gaza threaten to hand Hamas the greatest victory of its existence. If Hamas can wound Israel so deeply and yet live to fight again, it will have accomplished what ISIS could not — commit acts of the most brutal terror and then survive as an intact organization against a military that possesses the power to crush it outright. I agree with Dennis Ross, a former U.S. envoy to the Middle East: Any outcome that leaves Hamas in control in Gaza “will doom not just Gaza but also much of the rest of the Middle East.”

And hovering, just outside the frame, is China, watching carefully and measuring our will.

I understand both the good-faith right-wing objections to Ukraine aid and the good-faith progressive calls for a cease-fire in Israel. Ukraine needs an extraordinary amount of American support for a war that has no end in sight. It’s much easier to rally the West when Ukraine is on the advance. It’s much harder to sustain American support in the face of grinding trench warfare, the kind of warfare that consumes men and material at a terrifying pace.

I also understand that it is hard to watch a large-scale bombing campaign in Gaza that kills civilians, no matter the precision of each individual strike. Much like ISIS in Mosul, Hamas has embedded itself in the civilian population. It is impossible to defeat Hamas without harming civilians, and each new civilian death is a profound tragedy, one that unfolds in front of a watching world. It’s a testament to our shared humanity that one of our first instincts when we see such violence is to say, “Please, just stop.”

This instinct is magnified when the combination of the fog of war and Hamas disinformation can cause exaggerated or even outright false claims of Israeli atrocities to race across the nation and the world before the full truth is known. The sheer scale of the Israeli response is difficult to grasp, and there is no way for decent people to see the death and destruction and not feel anguish for the plight of the innocent.

The combination of tragedy, confusion and cost is what makes leadership so difficult. A good leader can’t overreact to any given news cycle. He or she can’t overreact to any specific report from the battlefield. And a good leader certainly can’t overreact to a negative poll.

I’ve long thought that politicians’ moment-by-moment reaction to activists, to members of the media and to polls is partly responsible for the decline in trust in American politicians. What can feel responsive in the moment is evidence of instability in the aggregate. The desperate desire to win each and every news cycle leads to short-term thinking. Politicians put out fires they see on social media, or they change course in response to anger coming from activists. Activists and critics in the media see an outrage and demand an immediate response, but what the body politic really needs is a thoughtful, deliberate strategy and the resolve to see it through.

No administration is perfect. Americans should object, for example, to the slow pace of approving each new weapons system for Ukraine. But in each key theater, Biden’s policies are fundamentally sound. We should support Ukraine as long as it’s necessary to preserve Ukrainian independence from Russian assault. We should stand by Israel as it responds to mass murder, including by supporting a lawful offensive into the heart of Gaza. And we should continue to strengthen alliances in the Pacific to enhance our allies’ military capabilities and share the burden of collective defense.

And we should do these things while articulating a moral vision that sustains our actions. On Thursday, John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communication, did just that. First, in an interview on “Morning Joe,” he described the efforts to aid Gazan civilians — a humanitarian and legal imperative. He made it clear that the United States is working to preserve civilian life, as it should.

Later on Thursday, he also provided a wider moral context. Asked at a news conference about Biden’s observation that innocents will continue to die as Israel presses its attacks, Kirby responded with facts we cannot forget: “What’s harsh is the way Hamas is using people as human shields. What’s harsh is taking a couple of hundred hostages and leaving families anxious, waiting and worrying to figure out where their loved ones are. What’s harsh is dropping in on a music festival and slaughtering a bunch of young people just trying to enjoy an afternoon.”

By word and deed, the Biden administration is getting the moral equation correct. There should be greater pressure on Hamas to release hostages and relinquish control of Gaza than there should be pressure on Israel to stop its offensive. Hamas had no legal or moral right to launch its deliberate attack on Israeli civilians. It has no legal or moral right to embed itself in the civilian population to hide from Israeli attacks. Israel, by contrast, has every right to destroy Hamas in a manner consistent with the laws of war.

If Biden can persevere in the face of the chaos and confusion of war abroad and polarization at home, all while preserving a level of economic growth that is astonishing in contrast with the rest of the world, he’ll have his own story to tell in Chicago, one that should trump the adversity of any given moment or the concern generated by any given poll. If Biden can do his job, then he can take the stage in Chicago with his own simple pitch for re-election: In the face of disease, war, inflation and division, the economy thrives — and democracy is alive."
351,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/opinion/hamas-violence-gaza.html,"In 2014, a new state was formed in the heart of the Middle East. It had a capital, a government, an army and almost 12 million subjects — a larger population than Jordan or Israel. It also had a commitment to butchery, savagery and fanatical violence that quickly earned it the enmity of the entire civilized world.

That universal enmity made it hard to imagine how this state of many names — the Islamic State, ISIS, Daesh — could long survive. At the time I offered a speculative analogy to the Bolsheviks in Russia, another ruthless bunch of revolutionary terrorists who faced general opprobrium and foreign interventions, but survived to govern Russia for several generations.

But in the event the more plausible scenario unfolded. By refusing even a sheen of moderation, by shocking the conscience of the world while seeking direct confrontation with Western power, the Islamic State enjoyed a temporary recruitment boom followed by a crushing extirpation. Even a weakened American empire in a more multipolar world was able to draw a circle around its barbarism and drive it back into statelessness by force of arms.

That antecedent hangs over the current crisis in Israel and Palestine. The atrocities perpetrated by Hamas against innocent Israelis, the snuff films, mutilations and delight in simple cruelty, inspired immediate analogies to the Islamic State’s depredations. They also raised a question about Hamas’s strategy. Was this, as some averred, a desperate but calculated leap to barbarism, undertaken on the theory that only true grisliness would yield the kind of Israeli reaction required to scuttle peacemaking between Israel and its Arab neighbors?"
352,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/opinion/israel-gaza-hamas-invasion.html,"For my part, I’m skeptical that either the invasion or the handover would go well, partly because I’ve observed so many military operations that started optimistically and ended as bloody quagmires. But Barak also made another important point: Israel will now finally end Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s policy of bolstering Hamas.

What? Israel supported Hamas?

Yes, under Netanyahu, Israel approved the transfer of over $1 billion to Gaza from Qatar — intended to cover expenses such as salaries and energy costs — but some funds reached Hamas’s military wing, Ha’aretz reported. (Qatar has denied that the money was misused.) Netanyahu’s aim, according to Barak and others, was to buttress Hamas so as to weaken the rival Palestinian Authority and undermine any possibility of a two-state solution. “Those who want to thwart the possibility of a Palestinian state should support the strengthening of Hamas and the transfer of money to Hamas,” Netanyahu reportedly said in 2019.

That monetary lifeline to Hamas will now surely be cut, and that may hurt the organization as much as any number of bombs.

Israel has the right to defend itself and strike military targets in Gaza, and there should be strong international pressure on Hamas to release its hostages. My reporting in Gaza over the years convinces me that Gazans themselves would be much better off if Hamas could be removed: Some American liberals don’t appreciate how repressive, misogynistic, homophobic and economically incompetent Hamas is in Gaza, to say nothing of its long history of terror attacks on Israel. All this explains why many Gazans are fed up with Hamas.

“Hamas spends money building tunnels, not investing in people,” a Gaza woman told me. She was stuck in Jerusalem, where her young son was receiving cancer treatment at a Palestinian hospital.

The despair in Gaza, she said, is such that for years some young men have simply dreamed of becoming “martyrs” and winning honor by killing Israelis.

“In Gaza, there is no hope,” she said. “There is no life, there is nothing we have from living in Gaza. The only thing people can do is become a martyr.”

The woman, whom I’m not identifying for fear of retaliation by Hamas, says that she is against the killing of civilians on either side and that now she weeps each day as she follows the bombing of Gaza and wonders if her husband and other children there will survive. Her son with cancer was sitting a few feet away, watching videos on his mom’s phone, and I looked over to see what he was watching.

It was TikToks of his neighborhood being bombed.

He was glued to the screen as videos showed areas the size of multiple football fields near his home turned into rubble; satellite imagery shows other large areas pulverized as well. No one knows how many people are caught in the wreckage, but some Gazans told me they had heard cries from inside collapsed buildings. They lack proper equipment to rescue people, so eventually, the cries stop, and a stench rises.

Despite her own opposition to Hamas, the woman said that anger at the Israeli attacks will probably boost support for Hamas in the territory.

One well-educated young woman inside Gaza, Amal, told me over WhatsApp that the victims she knew of were mostly civilians, and she sounded full of despair.

“Constant bombardment has me feeling as if I am not human anymore, as if our souls mean nothing at all,” she told me. “We are being massacred.”"

Mr. Biden has made repeated gestures of support to Muslims and Arab Americans: In an Oval Office address on Oct. 20, he denounced Islamophobia and the death of Wadea Al-Fayoume, a 6-year-old who was fatally stabbed in Illinois in what authorities have called a hate crime. Mr. Biden said he was “heartbroken” by the loss of Palestinian life in the war: “We can’t ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians who only want to live in peace and have an opportunity,” he said.

Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for the president’s re-election campaign, said that Mr. Biden “knows the importance of earning the trust of every community, of upholding the sacred dignity and rights of all Americans,” and is working closely with Muslim and Palestinian American leaders.

But many Arab Americans were outraged by Mr. Biden’s visit to Israel, his embrace of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his pledge that “we will continue to have Israel’s back.”

Nada Al-Hanooti, a Palestinian American organizer based in Dearborn, said that as of 2020, there were approximately 200,000 registered Muslim voters in Michigan, making the community a significant voting bloc in a battleground state of 8.2 million registered voters.

“In 2020, the Muslim community was instrumental in turning out the vote for Joe Biden,” said Ms. Al-Hanooti, the Michigan executive director of Emgage, a national organization that seeks to strengthen the political power of Muslim Americans. “We did a lot of get-out-the-vote efforts.”

Mr. Biden won the state by nearly 155,000 votes. Muslim voters turned out in significant numbers — 145,000 voted in the presidential election, according to Emgage. An exit poll commissioned by the Council on American-Islamic Relations found that roughly 69 percent of Muslims nationwide voted for Biden.

Ms. Al-Hanooti said Muslims turned out in large numbers for Mr. Biden mainly because they were motivated to help defeat President Trump. As a candidate for president, Mr. Trump called for a shutdown of Muslim immigration and referred to “radical Islam” infiltrating American communities; while in office, he issued an executive order that imposed restrictions on refugees and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries."
355,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/world/middleeast/cornell-jewish-threats-hochul.html,"In the wake of online posts threatening violence against Jewish students and institutions at Cornell University, Gov. Kathy Hochul on Monday visited the campus in Ithaca, N.Y., to condemn the posts as hate speech and lay out the steps her administration is taking to help keep students safe.

“We will not tolerate threats or hatred or antisemitism,” Ms. Hochul said during a morning visit to the Cornell Center for Jewish Living, which was specifically singled out for destruction in the posts. “If you’re going to engage in these harmful actions, hate crimes, breaking our laws, you will be caught, and you will be prosecuted.”

The threats were made on a website called Greekrank, where students from various universities discuss issues with fraternities and sororities, according to The Cornell Daily Sun, the student newspaper.

A number of Jewish students at Cornell learned of the threats around 5 p.m. on Sunday. One post called for the Jewish center to be torn down. Others urged people to kill Jews on campus and said that they needed to be “eliminated.”

The posts were shared among Jewish students participating in a chat forum on WhatsApp at the time, said Molly Goldstein, a junior who is co-president of the Center for Jewish Living. Within minutes, Cornell police officers arrived at the center, she said, followed by officers from the Ithaca Police Department.

By Monday morning, troopers with the New York State Police also were present, Ms. Goldstein said. Police vehicles blocked the driveway to the center, which includes a hall of residence and kosher dining hall, and officers walked the grounds.

Several Jewish students said they were grateful for the swift police response and Ms. Hochul’s visit.

“We could not appreciate it more,” Ms. Goldstein said.

“Our community is scared,” she said. “Our parents are scared. But we are strong, and we are proud, and we will continue to live and be our Jewish selves.”

The state police increased its presence on college campuses across New York after Hamas’s Oct. 7 terrorist attacks on Israel, Ms. Hochul said, and the New York State Intelligence Center has increased its efforts to monitor social media for antisemitic hate speech. The F.B.I. was notified of the posts as a potential hate crime, Ms. Hochul said.

Speaking of the Jewish students at Cornell, Ms. Hochul said: “I want them to know that they’re not alone, that they have the State of New York backing them. The terrorists, the people who are threatening them, will get no refuge here.”"

The demonstration, organized by Jewish Voice for Peace, came as Israel ramped up its military operations inside Gaza.

The protesters filled the train station, chanting, “Cease-fire now” and “Let Gaza live.” Most wore black shirts that read “Not in our name.” One police officer estimated that there were as many as 1,000 protesters.

Steve Auerbach, a pediatrician in the city, said he was concerned about the children caught in the middle of the conflict.

“This has to stop,” he said. “Calling for a cease-fire should be considered a mainstream, normative position.”

Banners declaring “Palestinians should be free” and “Israelis demand cease-fire now” were unfurled over stairwell banisters in the terminal."
357,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/opinion/israel-hamas-strategy-bennett.html,"Hamas’s master plan, as Bennett sees it, is roughly as follows: Provoke, via its gruesome massacres on Oct. 7, a massive Israeli ground invasion. Force Israeli troops to fight for weeks or months on unfamiliar and terrifying ground, causing thousands of casualties. Dribble out opportunities for hostage releases or cease-fires as a way of weakening Israel’s resolve and obtaining material concessions, particularly fuel. Bleed the Israeli economy dry by requiring the country to keep its citizen army mobilized for months. Count on diplomatic pressure and Israel’s well-known low tolerance for high casualties to get Jerusalem to call it quits after a few weeks of war, just as it often has in the past.

What Bennett envisions is to turn Hamas’s current assets into liabilities. Five in particular: terrain, time, triggers, the world’s attention and the hostages.

Militarily, the plan he sketches begins by having Israel establish a security zone in Gaza two kilometers deep while also cutting the territory in half, somewhere between Gaza City and Khan Younis. Already, nearly 800,000 Gazans have fled from north to south despite efforts by Hamas to keep them in place. Two humanitarian corridors, subject to Israeli controls, will allow civilians still trapped in the north to move south. Israel will permit water, food and medicine to reach the south and will create medical and humanitarian safe havens in the buffer zone.

This is the most manpower- and firepower-intensive part of Bennett’s plan, but it does not involve a thrust into the heart of Gaza’s cities. It leaves the north of Gaza completely cut off — above all, of energy. “There’s a reason they’re asking for fuel,” he says of Hamas’s recent attempts to trade hostages for gas. “They’re asking for fuel not for their citizens but for their tunnels,” which are used exclusively by Hamas fighters and their allies.

Gaining this kind of control means that Israel isolates the battlefield — a core requirement in any successful war and a time-tested way of protecting civilians. It allows most of Israel’s reservists to go home, relieving the heavy strain on the economy. It eases the crisis on the international stage while doing nothing to release Hamas from its chokehold.

Most important, it allows Israel to conduct what Bennett describes as an “ongoing and persistent series of targeted ground raids” over a long period without the need to occupy cities in force.

Smaller raids tend to produce fewer deaths, particularly civilian casualties, and less physical destruction, at least when compared with airstrikes or artillery fire. They play to the unique skills of Israel’s special forces. They reduce the chances of a triggering event in which large numbers of civilian casualties prompt Hezbollah to open a front in the north or Palestinians in the West Bank to start a third intifada. And they minimize the exposure of regular Israeli infantry to the hazards of dense urban combat.

“I don’t want to get into a Viet Cong-type war of tunnels,” Bennett says. “I want to surprise them by letting them dry out in the tunnels. Imagine a Hamas terrorist waiting in one of those tunnels with his weapons. The one thing he doesn’t expect is to be stuck there for nine months with no logistics backing, running out of food, cold, wet and miserable.”

As for the hostages, Bennett recognizes there are no easy answers. But he thinks Hamas has begun to realize that “holding babies, the elderly and foreign citizens is an inherent liability, given that they want public sympathy.” In the meantime, Hamas will probably do everything it can to keep the hostages alive and reasonably healthy, if only because they are useless to it when dead. This, too, is a drain on the group’s dwindling resources.

Bennett sees the war lasting months, even years, much like the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The long timetable imposes a need for patience on an Israeli public justifiably hungry for vengeance and victory. But the cumulative result of his concept would be the complete destruction of Hamas’s war-fighting capacity and the deaths of thousands of its fighters.

There’s a coda to his plan. At some point, any Hamas fighters who remain in Gaza will be offered the chance for passage to a third country — Algeria, maybe, or Qatar, where Hamas has financial patrons. While Bennett dislikes the linkage, safe passage may be the price Israel is willing to pay in the end for the freedom of remaining hostages.

“It would be like Beirut in 1982, when Yasir Arafat and all of his terrorists got on a boat and left Lebanon forever,” Bennett says, recalling the Palestinian leader’s forced eviction to Tunisia under Israel’s siege of the city. At that point, the displaced people of southern Gaza might choose to return to their homes, and the displaced people of southern Israel could confidently opt to go back to theirs.

Could it work? War never offers clean choices — particularly one that was foisted on Israel through a day of “pure, unadulterated evil,” as President Biden rightly called Hamas’s atrocities. There’s also a larger set of questions about what happens to Gaza after the war ends.

Israel will almost certainly keep the buffer zone in Gaza for years to come, not only for security but also as punishment for Hamas’s depredations. The Palestinian Authority will be reluctant, at least at first, to re-establish itself in the territory on the heels of Israel’s victory. In all likelihood, an international security presence will be needed in Gaza, much as in Kosovo after its war. This, too, could last years.

But the question isn’t whether Bennett’s plan is perfect or if there are gaps to fill. It is whether it’s better than the alternatives for achieving Israel’s core aims: destroying Hamas, exacting justice, protecting the innocent, deterring the wicked and, as David Petraeus once asked about Iraq, explaining to the world “how this ends.” By those counts, it’s a plan worthy of attention and respect."

Hezbollah, Arabic for the “Party of God,” emerged in the 1980s from the chaos of Lebanon’s long civil war to become one of the most powerful forces in the region.

When Israel pulled back from most of neighboring Lebanon three years after its 1982 invasion, its army remained along a thin border strip. But the toll from constant clashes with Hezbollah forced a withdrawal in 2000. Hezbollah fought a 33-day war with Israel again in 2006, and there have been almost daily exchanges of fire since Oct. 7.

Iran is believed to have supplied Hezbollah with powerful missiles that could strike most Israeli cities, and Israel would be hard pressed to fight in both Gaza and in the north if Hezbollah launched a significant campaign. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has vowed devastating consequences for any such effort.

Aside from being a Shiite militia, however, Hezbollah is also a political party seeking popular appeal among other Lebanese sects. So despite Hezbollah’s virulent anti-Israel rhetoric, a new war would wreak havoc on a country already reeling from an unprecedented economic and infrastructure crisis and risk angering the bulk of Lebanon’s estimated 5.5 million population.

SYRIA

The ruling Assad family, members of the minority Alawite sect, a splinter off Shiism, has long bolstered its grip at home by allying itself with Iran. That alliance proved especially useful after 2011, when President Bashar al-Assad faced an antigovernment uprising and eventually a civil war with extremist Sunni Muslim forces.

Iran supplied militia troops — Israel accused it of deploying as many as 80,000 men — to buttress Syrian ground forces, while Russia provided air power. Hezbollah also dispatched fighters from Lebanon.

The 1974 cease-fire line between Israel and Syria in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights remained quiet for decades, although there have been occasional exchanges of fire since the uprising began. In recent days, Israel has launched airstrikes to respond to artillery fire from Syria, which opposition analysts said was most likely fired by Hezbollah."
359,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/world/middleeast/palestine-gazans-hamas-food.html,"As supplies of virtually every basic human necessity dwindle in Gaza, one group in the besieged enclave remains well-stocked: Hamas.

Arab and Western officials say there is substance to Israeli claims of Hamas stockpiling supplies, including desperately needed food and fuel. Hamas, they say, has spent years building dozens of kilometers of tunnels under the strip where it has amassed stores of virtually everything needed for a drawn-out fight. It is a reality that Israel may soon find itself grappling with if it makes good on its threat to invade Gaza.

Hamas has hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel for vehicles and rockets; caches of ammunition, explosives and materials to make more; and stockpiles of food, water and medicine, the officials said. A senior Lebanese official said Hamas, which is estimated to number between 35,000 and 40,000, had enough stocked away to keep fighting for three to four months without resupply.

One of the four Israeli hostages released by Hamas even described the group providing captives with medicine, shampoo and feminine hygiene products. All are now said to be extraordinarily scarce in Gaza more than two weeks after Israel, aided by Egypt, imposed what it called a “complete” blockade following the attack by the terrorist group on Oct. 7.

The Arab and Western officials who described Hamas’s supply situation all spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were disclosing information gleaned from human sources, communications intercepts and other streams of intelligence. The stockpiles are typically kept underground, they said, and cautioned that precise details on Hamas’s supplies were difficult to come by.

While the blockade has left Gaza’s roughly 2 million people scraping by with what little food and water they scrounge up, it does not yet appear to have begun to degrade Hamas’s ability to fight. The group has launched hundreds of rockets at Israel since the blockade began and have fended off preliminary Israeli incursions into the enclave.

The supply situation speaks to the relative sophistication of Hamas as a fighting force — an axiom among military professionals is that while amateurs talk about tactics, professionals talk about logistics. Yet with Gazans facing a humanitarian catastrophe, Hamas’s stockpiles raise questions about what responsibility, if any, it has to the civilian population."
360,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/opinion/hamas-war-gaza-israel.html,"For 35 years, I’ve devoted my professional life to U.S. peacemaking policy and conflict resolution and planning — whether in the former Soviet Union, a reunified Germany or postwar Iraq. But nothing has preoccupied me like finding a peaceful and lasting solution between Israel and the Palestinians.

In the past, I might have favored a cease-fire with Hamas during a conflict with Israel. But today it is clear to me that peace is not going to be possible now or in the future as long as Hamas remains intact and in control of Gaza. Hamas’s power and ability to threaten Israel — and subject Gazan civilians to ever more rounds of violence — must end.

After Oct. 7, there are many Israelis who believe their survival as a state is at stake. That may sound like an exaggeration, but to them, it’s not. If Hamas persists as a military force and is still running Gaza after this war is over, it will attack Israel again. And whether or not Hezbollah opens a true second front from Lebanon during this conflict, it, too, will attack Israel in the future. The aim of these groups, both of which are backed by Iran, is to make Israel unlivable and drive Israelis to leave: While Iran has denied involvement in the Hamas attack, Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, has long talked about Israel not surviving for another 25 years, and his strategy has been to use these militant proxies to achieve that goal.

Given the strength of Israel’s military — by far the most powerful in the region — the aims of Iran and its collaborators seemed implausible until a few weeks ago. But the events of Oct. 7 changed everything. As one commander in the Israeli military said, “If we do not defeat Hamas, we cannot survive here.”

Israel is not alone in believing it must defeat Hamas. Over the past two weeks, when I talked to Arab officials throughout the region whom I have long known, every single one told me that Hamas must be destroyed in Gaza. They made clear that if Hamas is perceived as winning, it will validate the group’s ideology of rejection, give leverage and momentum to Iran and its collaborators and put their own governments on the defensive.

But they said this in private. Their public postures have been quite different. Only a few Arab states openly condemned the Hamas massacre of more than 1,400 people in Israel. Why? Because Arab leaders understood that as Israel retaliated and Palestinian casualties and suffering grew, their own citizens would be outraged and they needed to be seen as standing up for the Palestinians, at least rhetorically.

Nowhere was the instinct to cater to the mood of the street more vividly revealed than in the quick denunciations of Israel after Hamas claimed that Israel bombed Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza. Israel has denied hitting the hospital but in several Arab countries, Hamas’s claims were accepted. At this point, multiple national intelligence agencies have said it was most likely a Palestinian rocket that hit the hospital.

Nevertheless, people across the region — and the world — saw Israel bombing Gaza and were ready to believe this, too, was deliberately done. Even the United Arab Emirates, which had condemned the Hamas attack, issued a later statement condemning “the Israeli attack that targeted Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in the Gaza Strip, resulting in the death and injury of hundreds of people.” It went on to call on “the international community to intensify efforts to reach an immediate cease-fire to prevent further loss of life.”

As Israel's aerial bombardment of Gaza picks up in pace and civilian casualties rise, international calls for an immediate cease-fire are mounting. Some are calling for Israel to call off a ground invasion. But ending the war now would mean Hamas would win. At present, its military infrastructure still exists, its leadership remains largely intact, and its political control of Gaza is unchallenged. As Hamas did after conflicts with Israel in 2009, 2012, 2014 and 2021, the group will almost certainly rearm and restore. It will be able to add to its system of tunnels running under the enclave. The strip will remain impoverished, and the next round of war will be inevitable, holding both Gazan civilians and much of the rest of the Middle East hostage to Hamas’s aims.

An Israeli ground campaign would come at an extremely high cost. If it proceeds, invading Israeli soldiers will surely lose their lives, and there will be even more Palestinian casualties, a tragedy Hamas has ensured by embedding itself and its military capability in communities, using hospitals, mosques and schools to store its ammunition. But defeating Hamas cannot be done only with strategic strikes from the air, any more than we were able to root out ISIS in Mosul, Iraq, or Raqqa, Syria, from the air. In that fight, the United States had local partners who did the terrible and costly ground fighting in cities while our forces largely devastated them from above.

What would a defeat of Hamas mean? It would mean its military infrastructure, much of which is physically connected to civilian infrastructure, was largely destroyed and its leadership decimated, leaving the group without the capacity to block a reconstruction for demilitarization formula for Gaza, as it did in the past. In essence, this would mean there would be no war-making capacity in Gaza and that capacity could not be rebuilt.

That formula must guide the day-after reality in Gaza. It would require Israel to remain in Gaza after the fighting ends until it could hand over to some kind of an interim administration to prevent a vacuum and begin the enormous task of reconstruction. That administration should be largely run by Palestinian technocrats — from Gaza, the West Bank or the diaspora — under an international umbrella, which would include Arab and non-Arab nations. The United States would need to mobilize and organize the effort, possibly using an umbrella like the United Nations or the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee donor group to the Palestinians or even acting on the proposal by President Emmanuel Macron of France to use the international anti-ISIS coalition to counter Hamas. Such a coalition could help create the division of labor that would be necessary.

For example, Morocco, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain could provide police — not military forces — to ensure security for the new civil administration and those responsible for reconstruction. Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E and Qatar could provide the bulk of the funding for reconstruction, explaining their roles as necessary to relieve the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza and help them recover. Canada and others could provide monitoring mechanisms to ensure that assistance would go to its intended purposes.

Of course, the mood in Gaza after the fighting is over will be grim and angry. Thousands of civilians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry. Vast swaths of the enclave are uninhabitable. But it is worth noting that polls taken not long before the Oct. 7 attack revealed that 62 percent of Gazans were against Hamas breaking the cease-fire at the time with Israel. Getting aid into Gaza quickly and starting the reconstruction effort as soon as the fighting stops could help show residents that life can get better when Hamas is no longer preventing the rebuilding of Gaza.

How Israel would conduct a ground campaign would affect all of this and even whether such a day-after reality could materialize. For Israel to reduce the pressure from its neighbors and the international community to stop its attack, it must demonstrate more convincingly that it is fighting Hamas and is not trying to punish Palestinian civilians. It must create safe corridors for humanitarian assistance, including from Israeli territory through the Kerem Shalom crossing point. To alleviate the suffering, it should allow international groups, such as Doctors Without Borders, to operate safely there and include Israeli doctors who can set up field hospitals — something they have experience doing in Syria and Ukraine.

Israel’s political leaders need to clearly and publicly emphasize they will leave Gaza and lift the siege after Hamas has been militarily defeated and largely disarmed. They must communicate that they understand a political resolution is needed with the Palestinians more generally. That is not a message Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now conveying, given the shock in Israel and the makeup of his government. But it is one Israel’s partners in the region need to hear — and soon.

There are no easy solutions to Gaza, but there is only one path forward in this war. An outcome that leaves Hamas in control will doom not just Gaza but also much of the rest of the Middle East."
361,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/opinion/pediatrician-gaza-hospitals-fuel.html,"At Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, we are no strangers to treating victims of airstrikes over the years. The team all too often must rush into the emergency room, all hands on deck, ready to treat shrapnel wounds, burns and blood loss. In the early days of the current Israel-Hamas conflict, our hospital of only 80 beds was quickly overrun. On Oct. 17, following the explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, we were flooded with dozens of wounded and dying victims. By the next day, our patient roster had grown by nearly 120. We knew it would be another sleepless night, another in a string of far too many since the violence started 10 days earlier.

As many as three to four children had to share single beds, and many more were forced to settle for the floors. Some patients from the hospital explosion came in screaming in pain, but others were silent, in shock or beyond saving. With anesthesia, iodine, alcohol, blood and even gauze running low or entirely gone, we had a dwindling supply of tools to help ease the human suffering. The people who flocked to Kamal Adwan to sleep in our hallways or even the parking lot, believing it safer than their homes, were no doubt as frightened as we were.

As I write this, the hospital is on the precipice of true disaster. We are down to the last gallons of fuel necessary to run the electric generators, despite our most stringent efforts to ration it since the start of hostilities. Lights are off most of the time, elevators are out and patients are carried between floors. When the fuel runs out, we will no longer be able to function at night after the sun goes down. Most of the tools and equipment needed to run a modern hospital like ventilators, defibrillators and our neonatal units will become useless. When the generators fall silent, we will be relegated to practicing medieval-level medicine. Without an urgent resupply of fuel, the lights will go out permanently, and our hospital could turn into a morgue.

Kamal Adwan is far from the only hospital reaching its breaking point, as doctors like myself desperately cry out for more aid to Gaza. I’m a pediatrician at Kamal Adwan, part of a team of nine MedGlobal doctors and humanitarian aid workers that have been on the ground in Gaza since 2018. In that time we’ve seen our share of tragedy, suffering and shortage, but nothing could have prepared us for the horrors of the past few weeks. My team and I have divided our time between caring for patients and locally sourcing and distributing medical supplies, food and fuel to 11 different hospitals — $1.3 million worth of resources since the violence began. And it is still not nearly enough.

Most of us have chosen to remain in northern Gaza, defying the evacuation orders because we’re unwilling to leave behind our patients, for many of whom evacuation would mean certain death. Abandoning them now would be a violation of my Hippocratic oath as well as basic human decency. My wife and six children have also stayed at the hospital with me since the violence began. I’ve tried to convince them to head south, but my wife told me that we will either live or die together. Many Palestinians in north Gaza feel the same, risking their lives at home rather than face the prospect of becoming refugees in the south.

Doctors are no strangers to tragedy or death and are trained to steel themselves against it, but the pressure we’ve been under these past few weeks is beyond any training. One of my colleagues lost his father and brother to an airstrike in the first week of the fighting; another saw his dead son wheeled in by an emergency crew. At a professional level, a personal level and most fundamentally a human level, the people of Gaza and the medics who care for them are at a breaking point. Like our patients, especially the children, this conflict will leave every one of us traumatized.

Even so, we are treating our patients to the best of our ability with the bare minimum of electricity, medicine and supplies. We sterilize wounds with vinegar, previously unthinkable in our modern intensive care unit. Drinking water ran out days ago, and the water we do have isn’t potable, contributing to a rising tide of intestinal infections and diseases not seen in Gaza in years. Our morgue filled to capacity within the first week and we’ve had to store many dead children in a nearby tent, praying that the decomposing bodies don’t contaminate the water wells or spread further disease. We fear an outbreak of cholera and typhoid. We fear for the long-term mental health impacts on the children in our care. Their little bodies are quick to injure and quick to heal, but their minds and spirits will need a lifetime of care to overcome what they have seen and experienced.

On Oct. 20, as I finished operating on a girl who had lost her leg, I stepped into the hallway and my wife was there to hug me. Our home, she told me, had been destroyed in an airstrike on an adjacent building while I was in surgery. The hospital is now our only home. At night, I go to my office and close the door to cry, away from the eyes of my patients and family.

It may be hard to understand why any of us are still at the hospital, running our resupply routes and struggling against a sea of despair. The answer is hope. As Kamal Adwan Hospital and Gaza itself run out of everything — food, water, fuel, medicine — the one thing we have not yet run out of is hope. I see it in my fellow doctors and the MedGlobal team risking their life every day to drive the streets of Gaza delivering supplies. I see it in the eyes of our patients — not all, but many. There’s a resilience and tenacity at the heart of the human experience that’s stronger than any horrors men can inflict on one another.

Through that hope, we make an urgent plea to the rest of the world to send more aid into Gaza. In order for hospitals like Kamal Adwan to continue functioning, we desperately need more resources — especially fuel for our generators. If we cannot turn the lights back on and keep lifesaving equipment running, too many of our patients will end up needlessly dying.

We hope that people will read our story and share in our desires: for a cease-fire, for a full opening of border crossings so that the wounded and sick may leave and lifesaving supplies can reach the tired, hungry and the displaced. For a normal life of peace where hospitals in the region see Israeli and Palestinian patients side by side, unburdened by grief, separation and war. We need the world’s help to sustain these hopes and bring this senseless violence to an end."
362,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-israel-in-egypt-review.html,"Handel is not a composer typically associated with controversy, but the New York Philharmonic found itself entering a difficult public discourse with its performances of the oratorio “Israel in Egypt” this week at David Geffen Hall.

As thousands have died in the Israel-Hamas war, and as the conflict has inflamed tensions around the world, Cambridge University’s opera society has canceled a performance of Handel’s “Saul,” which depicts the Israelite David’s victory over the Philistine Goliath. That is the oratorio Handel wrote before “Israel in Egypt,” about a powerless people fleeing the subjugation of an oppressive state.

“Israel in Egypt” is less dramatic than “Saul,” and for its concerts, the Philharmonic opted for a program note. In it, the organization’s leadership clarified that this week’s performances were planned more than a year ago and added, “What we could not have anticipated is recent world events, making the timing of this program particularly relevant.”

The oratorio’s tale could have been a source of empathy and catharsis for audiences, but that’s not exactly the piece Handel wrote. For those familiar with “Messiah,” Handel’s other English-language oratorio that lifts its text from Scripture, “Israel in Egypt” is an oddity. Written almost entirely for choral forces, with few showpieces for the soloists, it narrates the Jewish exodus that Moses led from Egypt. To modern ears, the text painting of the 10 plagues is so lightweight that it verges on silliness: The orchestra leaps to depict frogs, buzzes for flies and thumps for hailstones."
363,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/opinion/girl-scouts-palestine-muslim-activism.html,"In her short 17 years on earth, Amira Ismail had never been called a baby killer.

That’s what happened one Friday this month, Amira said, on New York City’s Q58 bus, which runs through central Queens.

“This lady looked at me, and she was like: ‘You’re disgusting. You’re a baby killer. You’re an antisemite,’” Amira told me. When she talked about this incident, her signature spunk faded. “I just kept saying, ‘That’s not true,’” she said. “I was just on my way to school. I was just wearing my hijab.”

Amira was born in Queens in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks. She remembers participating as a child in demonstrations at City Hall as part of a successful movement to make Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha school holidays in New York City.

But since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, in which an estimated 1,400 Israelis were killed and some 200 others were kidnapped, Amira, who is Palestinian American, said she has experienced for the first time the full fury of Islamophobia and racism that her older relatives and friends have told stories about all her life. Throughout the city, in fact, there has been an increase in both anti-Muslim and antisemitic attacks.

In heavily Muslim parts of Queens, she said, police officers are suddenly everywhere, asking for identification and stopping and frisking Muslim men. (New York City has stepped up its police presence around both Muslim and Jewish neighborhoods and sites within the five boroughs.) Most painful though, she said, is the sense that she and her peers are getting that Palestinian lives do not matter, as they watch the United States staunchly back Israel as it heads into war.

“It can’t go unrecognized, the thousands of Palestinians that have been murdered in the past two weeks and even more the past 75 years,” Amira said. “There’s no way you can erase that.” That does not mean she is antisemitic, she said. “How can I denounce one system of oppression without denouncing another?” she asked me. The pain in her usually buoyant voice cut through me. I had no answer for her.

Many New York City kids have a worldliness about them, a certain telltale moxie. Amira, a joyful, sneaker-wearing, self-described “Queens kid,” can seem unstoppable.

When she was just 15, Amira helped topple a major mayoral campaign in America’s largest city, writing a letter accusing the ultraprogressive candidate Dianne Morales of having violated child labor laws while purporting to champion the working class in New York.

“My life and my extremely bright future as a 15-year-old activist will not be defined by the failures and harm enabled by Dianne Morales,” Amira wrote in the 2021 letter, which went viral and helped end Ms. Morales’s campaign. “I wrote my college essay about that,” Amira told me with a slightly mischievous smile.

In the past two years, Amira has become a veteran organizer. Last weekend, she joined an antiwar protest. First, though, she’ll have to work on earning her latest Girl Scout badge, this one for photography. That will mean satisfying her mother, Abier Rayan, who happens to be Troop 4179’s leader. “She’s tough,” Amira assured me.

At a meeting of the Muslim Girl Scouts of Astoria last week, a young woman bounded into the room, asking whether her fellow scouts had secured tickets to an Olivia Rodrigo concert. “She’s the Taylor Swift of our generation,” the scout turned to me to explain.

A group of younger girls recited the Girl Scout Law:

“I will do my best to be honest and fair, friendly and helpful, considerate and caring, courageous and strong, and responsible for what I say and do, and to respect myself and others, respect authority, use resources wisely, make the world a better place and be a sister to every Girl Scout.”

Amira’s mother carefully inspected the work of some of the younger scouts; she wore a blue Girl Scouts U.S.A. vest, filled with colorful badges, and a hot-pink hijab. “It’s no conflict at all,” Ms. Rayan told me of Islam and the Girl Scouts. “You want a strong Muslim American girl.”

At the Girl Scouts meeting, Amira and her friends discussed their plans to protest the war in Gaza. “Protests are where you let go of your anger,” Amira told me.

Amira’s mother was born in Egypt. In 1948, Ms. Rayan told me, her grandfather lost his home and land in Jaffa to the state of Israel. At the Girl Scout meeting, Ms. Rayan was still waiting for word that relatives in Gaza were safe.

“There’s been no communication,” she said. When I asked about Amira, Ms. Rayan’s eyes brightened. “I’m really proud of her,” she said. “You have to be strong. You don’t know where you’re going to be tomorrow.”

By Monday, word had reached Ms. Rayan that her relatives had been killed as Israel bombed Gaza City. When I asked whom she had lost, Ms. Rayan replied: “All of them. There’s no one left.” Thousands of Palestinians are estimated to have been killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in recent weeks. A death toll is kept by the Gaza Health Ministry, run by Hamas, and cannot be independently verified. Ms. Rayan said those killed in her family included six cousins and their children, who were as young as 2. Other relatives living abroad told her the cousins died beneath the rubble of their home.

As Ms. Rayan spoke, I saw Amira’s young face. I wondered how long this bright, spirited Queens kid could keep her fire for what I believe John Lewis would have called “good trouble” in a world that seems hellbent on snuffing it out. I worried about how she would finish her college applications.

“I have a lot of angry emotions at the ones in charge,” Amira told me days ago, speaking for so many human beings around the world in this dark time.

I thought about what I had seen over that weekend in Brooklyn, where thousands gathered in the Bay Ridge neighborhood, the home of many Arab Americans, to protest the war. In this part of the city, people of many backgrounds carried Palestinian flags through the street. Large groups of police officers gathered on every corner, watching them go by.

The crowd was large but quiet when Amira waded in, picked up her megaphone and called for Palestinian liberation. In an instant, thousands of New Yorkers repeated after her, filling the Brooklyn street with their voices. My prayer is that Amira’s generation of leaders will leave a better world than the one it has been given."
364,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/technology/hamas-violent-videos-online.html,"The strategy mirrors efforts by extremist groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, which took advantage of the lack of guardrails at social media companies years ago to upload graphic footage to the internet. Social media companies reacted then by removing and banning accounts tied to those groups.

The issue has sprouted anew in the past week, particularly on X, where safety and content moderation teams have largely disbanded under Elon Musk’s ownership, and on Telegram, the messaging platform which does virtually no content moderation.

Israeli groups who monitor social media for hate speech and disinformation said graphic imagery often starts on Telegram. It then moves to X before finding its way to other social media sites.

“Twitter, or X as they are now called, has become a war zone with no ethics,” said Achiya Schatz, director of FakeReporter, an Israeli organization that monitors disinformation and hate speech. “In the information war being fought, it is now a place where you just go and do whatever you want.”

In the past, his group reported fake accounts or violent content to X, which removed the post if it violated its rules, Mr. Schatz said. Now, he added, there is no one at the company to talk to."
365,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/us/politics/us-iran-airstrikes.html,"The American strikes on two Iranian military munitions stockpiles in Syria on Friday were carefully designed, President Biden’s aides said, to send two distinct messages to Tehran.

The first was that if the attacks on American forces by Iranian proxies escalate, it would force the United States into the kind of overt military confrontation with Iran that both nations have avoided since the Iranian revolution in 1979.

And the second was that if the attacks stop, both sides could quietly back away, free to resume the simmering hostilities that have characterized the relationship in recent years.

It is the latest gamble by the United States to modify Iran’s behavior, few of which have worked in the past. And now, with the backdrop of a new war in the Middle East, President Biden is signaling that Tehran’s best bet is to stay clear of involvement. The main goal, said John F. Kirby, a White House spokesman, is “to deter and to prevent future attacks.”"

He bristled with righteous indignation as he denounced the bloody Hamas attack in unforgiving terms and vowed to stand by Israel without equivocation.

Over the course of 10 minutes, Mr. Biden called the strike on Israel “pure, unadulterated evil,” “sheer evil” and “indiscriminate evil.” Again and again, the outrage spilled out: “Atrocities.” “Sickening.” “Abhorrent.” “Brutality.” “Violation of every code of human morality.”

He recounted one instance of rampaging violence after another, a roster of horrors that has shocked much of the world not to mention his White House. Even for a president who often wears his emotions on his sleeve, it was a striking moment, possibly the most personal anger that he has displayed in public since taking office nearly three years ago. It was raw and it was memorable.

It was also an effort to leave no daylight between him and Israel during its greatest crisis in half a century, no room for his political opponents at home or America and Israel’s enemies abroad to exploit. Unlike other presidents during past eruptions of violence in the Middle East, he made no effort to express understanding of different sides, no move to urge restraint or seek diplomatic offramps. Instead, he promised that more military hardware was on its way."

I warned that we will not be able to continue our humanitarian operation if we do not get the fuel supply. My warning still stands.

But investors and economists will watch for any hint about whether rates are likely to stay that way — or whether central bankers still think they might need to increase them again in the coming months.

Officials will release a statement announcing their policy decision at 2 p.m., followed by a news conference with Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, at 2:30 p.m. Both will offer policymakers a chance to signal what they think might come next for interest rates and the economy.

Central bankers have already raised interest rates to a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent in a push to tame inflation. That rate setting is up from near-zero as recently as early 2022, and is the highest level in 22 years.

Higher borrowing costs are meant to make it more expensive to buy a home, purchase a car or expand a business using a loan. By tapping the brakes on demand and hiring, that slows the broader economy, which can help to put a lid on price increases.

Fed officials have widely signaled that they are close to the point where they no longer need to raise interest rates — simply leaving them around this level will cool the economy and help drive inflation back down to their 2 percent goal over time. The question now is twofold: Will policymakers feel it necessary to make one more quarter-point interest-rate move later this year or early next? And once they decide that rates are high enough, how long will they leave them elevated?

Here’s what to watch for on Wednesday."

370,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/us/politics/desantis-ukraine-china.html,"Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, working to maintain his second-place status in the Republican primary, said Friday that as president he would “reorient” U.S. foreign policy to give clear priority to China while downplaying national security risks posed by conflicts such as Russia’s war on Ukraine.

In a speech laying out his approach, Mr. DeSantis cast Beijing as a greater threat to the United States than the Axis powers and the Soviet Union ever were because of its economic might. As commander in chief, he said, he would “prioritize the Indo-Pacific region as the most pressing part of the world for defending U.S. interests and U.S. security.”

A less aggressive approach, he argued, would allow China to export its “authoritarian vision all across the world,” creating a “global dystopia.”

“They seek to be the dominant power in the entire world, and they are marshaling all their society to be able to achieve that objective,” Mr. DeSantis said. “So this is a formidable threat and it requires a whole of society approach.”

Mr. DeSantis’s remarks, delivered in Washington, D.C., at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, come at a difficult moment for his presidential campaign. Not only is he badly trailing former President Donald J. Trump in the polls, but Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and former ambassador to the United Nations, has successfully positioned herself as a credible alternative to Mr. Trump, puncturing the Florida governor’s argument that the Republican presidential primary is a two-man race.

Mr. DeSantis has lately used foreign policy to attack other Republican presidential candidates, rebuking Mr. Trump for his critical comments about Israeli leaders and accusing Ms. Haley — who is attracting growing interest from Republican donors and voters — of being soft on China.

Never Back Down, a pro-DeSantis super PAC, has spent roughly $2.4 million against Ms. Haley this month, largely to criticize her foreign policy record — its first major investment against a candidate who wasn’t Mr. Trump. (Ms. Haley’s campaign has pushed back against those assertions, and fact checkers have shown that Mr. DeSantis’s claim that she supports allowing Gazan refugees into the United States is false.)

While the Republican base has moved away from the neoconservative, interventionist policies of George W. Bush, Mr. DeSantis has taken heat from the G.O.P.’s national security establishment for some of his isolationist tendencies. This year, he called the war in Ukraine a “territorial dispute,” comments that he later walked back. On the campaign trail in the early nominating states, he has faced pointed questions from voters, particularly in moderate New Hampshire, about whether he would cede Ukraine to its Russian invaders.

Mr. DeSantis on Friday also accused China of fueling the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel by supporting Russia and Iran, saying that President Biden’s policies toward those adversaries had encouraged their aggression.

He touched on how Ukraine would fit into his foreign policy vision, suggesting that U.S. efforts to aid the democratic nation in its fight against Russia were a distraction from America’s more pressing interests. The United States has given Ukraine billions in security assistance, including weapons. But continuing that outlay has been a point of tension within the G.O.P. and has become the center of the spending fight in Congress.

“Lengthy conflicts, particularly between Russia and Ukraine, will ultimately benefit China because it will distract America and it will deplete our already dwindling Western weapons and ammunition stockpiles,” Mr. DeSantis argued, adding that “the threat posed by the C.C.P. requires our primary focus and attention,” in a reference to the Chinese Communist Party.

While Mr. DeSantis emphasized his longstanding support for Israel in his China-centric speech, he did not specify what type of additional assistance the U.S. government should provide. He said this week that the United States should continue its military aid to the Jewish state, but noted that “it’s Israel’s war.”

Still, on Friday, he defended Israel’s right “to fully defend itself against these barbarous attacks” by Hamas.

As a three-term congressman who served on the House Foreign Affairs Committee before being elected governor of Florida in 2018, Mr. DeSantis established a foreign policy record that many of his allies described as “Jacksonian,” a reference to President Andrew Jackson’s approach. Such a worldview favors a robust military but has a narrow conception of the national interest that focuses on protecting American territory, people, hard assets and commercial interests overseas.

That vision of building hard power but only using it when necessary was on display in Mr. DeSantis’s speech to the Heritage Foundation.

“As a veteran of the Iraq war, I recognize the gravity of deploying U.S. troops in combat and hope to never have to do that as commander in chief,” said Mr. DeSantis, who served as a Navy lawyer. “But if such a duty calls, I will ensure that the U.S. will be fully committed to winning. Our forces will have what they need to be lethal and capable, preferably to deter conflict in the first place, but also to achieve a decisive, overwhelming victory if conflict arises.”

He also repudiated America’s “post-9/11 neoconservatism,” saying it “represented a departure from traditional, Reaganesque ‘peace through strength’ policies.”

Mr. DeSantis said he would counter China by expanding the U.S. Navy, increasing American energy production and the mining of rare-earth minerals, overhauling the nation’s industrial manufacturing base, protecting domestic technology and intellectual property and slashing “the bloated defense bureaucracy.”

And he took several opportunities to criticize Mr. Biden, describing his foreign policy as “rudderless, weak, misguided” and saying that one of his own first priorities as president would be to secure the nation’s borders.

In response, Sarafina Chitika, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, said that Mr. DeSantis’s “foreign policy agenda would endanger the United States and undermine our allies.”

“It’s clear he’s out of his depth,” Ms. Chitika said in a statement."
371,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/books/etgar-keret-israel-interview.html,"It feels like a lot is being asked of you in this moment.

First of all, I think nobody asked me for anything. And I’m not doing a lot. I think what I’m mostly doing is, I’m keeping myself busy and trying to convince myself that there is some use for my existence. It’s really as basic as that.

What happened in Israel on Oct. 7 — the perspective that people like me got was very weird, because you see people in the TV studio, while others are calling them saying: “Please send help. They killed my daughter. They’re burning the house down. I’m burning. I’m dying.” You were trapped in the intimacy of inhuman acts, and you felt helpless in this situation. There was nothing you could do. And I’m saying that I think that any person who’s sensitive or even insensitive — I think that this entire nation is going through PTSD. We’ve been through something. I think that I had to deal with my helplessness, with my inability to save those people.

So you felt a lot of impotence.

I felt all these dumb things. Like, I don’t drive. I’m 56, and I don’t drive. And suddenly that day I thought: If I had a driving license, I could go to the south. Maybe I could save somebody. That was my thought. Like, you dumb [expletive]. I don’t even know how to put a bandage on somebody who’s hurt.

I think I always felt that there was something about my incompetence, that it was kind of my mystique. Like, here is a guy who has lived more than half his life and can’t scramble an egg. I thought it was cute. But, suddenly, it didn’t feel cute. And I think that this feeling was only broken when I saw other people collapsing. And what I feel that maybe I have to give is to be some kind of presenter of failed humanity. To say: I’m confused.

Can you explain to me how you feel about the invocation of the Holocaust at this time? Because I’ve heard what happened on Oct. 7 compared to the Holocaust. And I’m wondering how that sits with you, as the child of Holocaust survivors.

In some sense I feel that my parents trained me all my life for this moment. And I think that the most important thing that I got from my parents was saying that when there are big incidents, there are big narratives. And those big narratives would say: You have a role. You are now a victim. You are now a hero. And they said, “Don’t believe those roles.”

What is the narrative that’s being written now?

Well, I think that we are living in a very binary world, with social media and all the vaccinators, anti-vaccinators, Trump, Democrats. So I think that in this sense, there are many super strong sentiments right now.

I wrote an op-ed for The New York Times a long time ago about how I don’t like the terms “pro-Israel” and “pro-Palestinian.” Because when you speak to somebody and he says that he’s pro-Israel or pro-Palestinian, then it doesn’t matter what argument you’re going to give, he’s going to stay in the same opinion.

It’s like, being “pro-Israeli,” are you pro-children dying in Gaza from bombing? The idea is that reality is complex, and, for me, the primal responsibility is a human one.

And when I see people watching the horrible tragedy that is happening here as if it were a Super Bowl of victimhood, in which you support one team and really don’t care about the other, empathy becomes very, very selective. You see only some pain. You don’t want to see other pain. I think that in situations like this, it’s a reflex to go to something that you know. But it’s a bad reflex when the world changes around you.

I’m seeing it here in the United States. Certainly, you’re seeing it there — how the words we use to describe what we’re experiencing are so charged. And as a writer, words are central to what you do. And I’m wondering how you’re choosing your words?

Well, I didn’t write anything in the past two weeks. I write these iPhone notes for myself, mostly to digest the things that I saw or heard about. But I think that the most attacked posts on the internet are those of people saying, “Oh, my god, I see people dying in Israel and I see people dying in Palestine, and it breaks my heart.” If you put up a post like that, they will rip you to pieces from both sides. And I’m saying that, in this sense, I do feel some kind of deterioration, a human deterioration.

But there is this real wrestling with what exactly should be said at this moment. I just had an Arab friend, who is not Palestinian, tell me that a Jewish work colleague asked her to disavow Hamas. And my Arab friend then asked that work colleague to condemn the killing of civilians in Gaza. They got into this entire discussion. And it really made me think about what we are asking of each other in this moment.

That’s crazy. This idea of people saying: Condemn this, condemn that. I don’t want anybody to condemn anything. I say, be human. You see somebody in pain, try to see that pain. Later, there’s enough time to figure out whose fault it is. I speak to people, also in Israel, who say, “After what we’ve been through, after I lost my sister, I don’t care how many people die in Gaza.” And I say to people: When you do that, you’re hurting yourself. You’re hurting yourself. You are basically saying: “I’m downgrading myself. I want to be something that is less than what I used to be.” It’s the inability to say: I don’t know. I don’t understand. I’m confused. I have feelings, but I don’t have a structure around them. And it’s OK.

I keep talking about my parents. But when I was a kid, and I first heard about the Holocaust, I asked my father if the Holocaust was the worst time of his life. And my father thought for a moment, and he said: “I don’t split life by good periods and bad periods. I always see them as easy periods and difficult periods.” And he said: “All my life I’ve been chasing the easy times. But it’s the difficult times in which you learn about yourself the most.” I think what he was trying to say was: Take this difficulty and let it change you. Learn things about yourself. Acknowledge the fact that I should have learned how to drive and not have been lazy. Deal with that! You know? And I really feel that this difficult time, it’s kind of an unveiling. It’s like taking off a mask.

How so?

I think over the past 20 years in the Middle East, in the Netanyahu/Hamas era, there was this kind of strange symbiosis that almost felt like some kind of ritual: Hamas would kill some Jews in a terrorist attack or rocket attack. And then we would bomb Gaza, and we’d kill Hamas people but also citizens as collateral damage. And, basically, after every couple of years, it was contained.

It was like letting off a pressure valve.

It’s basically saying, “Oh, in two months, we’re going to have a few hundred people dead, bury your babies, but it’s worth it.” And it’s this kind of cycle in which people say this is manageable. Palestinians are occupied? They can stay occupied. We’re being bombed? We can stay being bombed. This is as good as it gets. And I think that the magnitude of what has happened here has made this impossible.

So I’m saying that, as my father said, it’s a difficult time. I won’t be sad if we learn the lesson, if something out of this will give and break. But for that, we have to be curious and we have to search and we have to allow ourselves to be confused and to look for answers, not to have them instantly.

That is a both depressing and hopeful analysis of the situation.

Yeah, “depressed and hopeful” — I think it’s a good way to sum up my situation right now.

Etgar, I hate when people ask this question, but I’m going to ask it anyway.

Why do you ask, if you hate it?

Because I can’t help myself. And I want to know: Where does that leave you, the Palestinians, the region, the world? I mean, what happens now?

I don’t know where it will lead. I wish I were a leader, because then I could lead us to where I wanted. But if you’re asking me what I’m wishing for, it’s that we will be in a region in which the Israeli people will not be governed by Netanyahu and a bunch of right-wing, trigger-happy people, and that the Palestinians will not be governed by Hamas. If we reach this position, I believe that this can be solved. I’m dumb! I’m a writer! I don’t know. But I truly believe that this can be solved. But we need to reboot. It’s not working.

We kept ignoring the fact that it’s not working. Netanyahu kept saying, “Oh, we can do deals with Hamas.” The fact that they do all those things and are a terrorist organization — they’re pragmatic. OK, now we know they’re not pragmatic. Now we know that Netanyahu’s game of strengthening Hamas to block any chance of a Palestinian state didn’t work. And we get this very, very simple lesson: If you occupy people, if you put them in a cage, in the end, they’re going to break that cage and go for your throat. If you let them live in a dignified way, at least there is a chance. I don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t know. But I’m saying: All I want is for us to have a chance.

372,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/us/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-anniversary.html,"It has been five years since a gunman stormed into the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, killing 11 worshipers and wounding six others in the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history.

A lot can happen in a half a decade. One of the three congregations that met at Tree of Life hired its first rabbi. New nonprofit organizations sprung up to serve survivors and others affected by antisemitism and violence. Plans to reconfigure and expand the building took shape, with a celebrity architect at the helm. And in August, the gunman was convicted on an array of federal charges and sentenced to death.

For some in the Tree of Life community, however, this year’s anniversary is not arriving with the sense of healing they hoped for. Weeks after more than 1,400 people were killed in a Hamas terror attack in southern Israel, many American Jews have felt their sense of safety shattered.

Now, Israeli airstrikes are pummeling Gaza, and the humanitarian crisis in the territory is worsening, with food and water in short supply and civilian deaths mounting.

But as many Jews in the United States are grieving the civilian deaths in Israel, and worried for families and friends there, some also feel abandoned by former political allies — including many of the same people and organizations that embraced Tree of Life five years ago.

Muslim organizations raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for victims in the weeks after the attack; Catholic parishes organized special collections. Thousands of people attended vigils, and statements of support poured in from across the world."
373,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/opinion/israel-gaza-colonizers.html,"We’re living through an era of collapsing paradigms. The conceptual frames that many people use to organize their understanding of the world are crashing and burning upon contact with Middle Eastern reality.

The first paradigm that failed this month was critical race theory or woke-ism. Yascha Mounk has a good history of this body of thought in his outstanding book “The Identity Trap.” But as it applies to the Middle East the relevant ideas in this paradigm are these: International conflicts can be seen through a prism of American identity categories like race. In any situation there are evil people who are colonizer/oppressors and good people who are colonized/oppressed. It’s not necessary to know about the particular facts about any global conflict, because of intersectionality: All struggles are part of the same struggle between the oppressors and the oppressed.

This paradigm shapes how many on the campus left saw the Hamas terror attacks and were thus pushed into a series of ridiculous postures. A group of highly educated American progressives cheered on Hamas as anti-colonialist freedom fighters even though Hamas is a theocratic, genocidal terrorist force that oppresses L.G.B.T.Q. people and revels in the massacres of innocents. These campus activists showed little compassion for Israeli men and women who were murdered at a music festival because they were perceived as “settlers” and hence worthy of extermination. Many progressives called for an immediate cease-fire, denying Israel the right to defend itself, which is enshrined in international law — as if Nigeria should have declared a cease-fire the day after Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls in 2014.

American universities exist to give students the conceptual tools to understand the world. It appears that at many universities students are instead being fed simplistic ideological categories that blind them to reality."
374,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/world/middleeast/unrwa-gaza-aid.html,"The U.N. agency that has been aiding Palestinian refugees for the past 74 years said on Thursday that it had begun to significantly reduce its operations in the Gaza Strip after nearly exhausting its fuel reserves, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis that the agency’s top official described as “hell on Earth.”

The United Nations Relief Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees, or UNRWA, said in a statement that it had to reduce water supplies, as well as to cut down on fuel it provided to power generators, medical centers and bakeries.

“We can skimp or ration to an extent, and we have bought ourselves some more hours doing this,” Hector Sharp, the UNRWA head of field legal office, said from Gaza. But Gaza will run out of fuel at some point and “the world will, I hope, sit up and say, ‘We are going to send fuel.’ But it will be too late.”

Here’s a closer look at the organization and its work.

Why was UNRWA set up?

Originally intended to provide temporary relief, UNRWA was established in 1949 to assist Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Palestinians are the only refugee group whose support is not handled under the broader mandate of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

The agency has been operating in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank and the Gaza Strip, providing health care, food, jobs, emergency loans, housing assistance and education to millions of Palestinians. It is funded almost entirely by voluntary donations by U.N. member states, with the United States and the European Union countries providing most of the financing.

What is UNRWA’s relationship with Israel?

Israel has objected to UNRWA’s definition of Palestinians as refugees, and has been especially vocal against extending that category to those born in the Gaza Strip. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went as far as to call for the disbanding of UNRWA, accusing it of perpetuating rather than solving the Palestinian “refugee problem.”

“The Israelis believe that Arab nations, especially, want the Palestinian refugee problem to remain unresolved, so that there’s a constant reminder of the Palestinian tragedy,” said Ahron Bregman, a senior teaching fellow at King’s College London who specializes in the Arab-Israeli conflict. “UNRWA, as the Israelis see it, is a tool to keep the Palestinian refugee problem unresolved.”

But some experts said that despite the hostile public remarks, Israel actually needed UNRWA in the Gaza Strip to provide stability in the region. “Behind the scenes Israel has often favored UNRWA’s work,” said Dr. Anne Irfan, an expert on Palestinian refugee rights at the University College London. “The agency has been providing services that otherwise Israel would have had to provide as an occupying power.”

Most of UNRWA’s staff on the ground are Palestinians. Since Oct. 7, 39 of them have been killed, many of them in their homes or while doing their jobs, the agency says. Another 22 have been injured, and thousands more remain in harm’s way as they continue providing aid to civilians amid Israeli airstrikes.

What does UNRWA do?

UNRWA mainly provides services and funding for those registered as Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. (The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is responsible for Palestinian refugees outside UNRWA’s areas of operation.)

It is a major employer in a region where almost half of adults remain unemployed. It also runs schools for almost 300,000 children and provides emergency loans and housing assistance.

“Essentially, for the last few decades we have been operating a parallel government in Gaza,” Mr. Sharp said. “We had an education department, a health care department. We were building more schools, health care clinics. We had projects to build roads and playgrounds.”

And since Israel began retaliating for the Hamas assaults of Oct. 7, the agency — which has been aiding Palestinian refugees for the last 74 years — has become a lifeline for more than a million displaced Palestinians. Almost 630,000 of them found shelter in 150 buildings that previously housed UNRWA-operated schools, and thousands seek medical help every day in UNRWA-run clinics.

375,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/us/politics/jake-sullivan-foreign-affairs-israel-middle-east.html,"In a 7,000-word essay for Foreign Affairs magazine published this week, Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, tried to sum up the state of the Middle East.

“Although the Middle East remains beset with perennial challenges,” he wrote in the original version of the essay, “the region is quieter than it has been for decades.”

While noting that challenges remained, including a tense situation between Israelis and Palestinians and the threat from Iran, he wrote that in the face of “serious” frictions, “we have de-escalated crises in Gaza.”

Mr. Sullivan’s assertions did not age well.

Just five days after his article was sent to print on Oct. 2, Hamas staged a devastating terror attack inside Israel, killing at least 1,400 Israelis and taking hundreds of people hostage. Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes against Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, have killed thousands of people and led to a humanitarian crisis.

Nobody can be expected to predict the future, but the essay offers a rare insight into how the United States misread an explosive situation in the Middle East. In the end, all of the diplomacy, intelligence sharing, check-ins and visits did not anticipate the worst breach of Israeli defenses in half a century.

Before the article was posted online, Foreign Affairs asked Mr. Sullivan to update it to reflect the Hamas attack. The online version scrubbed Mr. Sullivan’s “quieter” sentence, as well as his assertion that the Biden administration had “de-escalated” crises in Gaza. (An editor’s note included a pdf of the original essay, which appears in the November/December 2023 issue.)

Mr. Sullivan had made similar public comments to those in his essay.

On Sept. 29, he shared his assessment with some of the nation’s foreign policy, political and media circles: “The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades,” Mr. Sullivan told attendees at a festival held by The Atlantic, ticking through a list of examples that included a lengthy truce in Yemen and a cessation of attacks on U.S. troops by Iran-backed militias. The Hamas attack happened several days later.

The president’s critics have pounced. A fund-raising email sent to supporters by the Trump campaign on Wednesday chastised “Biden’s Delusional National Security Adviser” with a link to a story about Mr. Sullivan’s comments. Conservative media publications have followed suit.

Not all of Mr. Sullivan’s critics are on the right.

Brett Bruen, who served as director of global engagement in the Obama White House, said Mr. Sullivan was driven by “a myopic focus on some diplomatic deliverable over a real strategy.”

“Jake’s brilliant, but he’s never spent any significant amount of time in any of these places,” said Mr. Bruen, who called for Mr. Sullivan’s firing after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, when 13 U.S. service members and scores of Afghans were killed.

Still, he praised Mr. Sullivan, an alumnus of the Obama administration and a former close adviser to Hillary Clinton, as a foreign policy talent who helped lead an “impressive” U.S. response to the attack on Israeli civilians.

As for Mr. Biden’s experience in the region, Mr. Bruen said “experience can also be a liability when you’re looking at the world the way it was a couple of decades ago, not the way it is now.”

He added: “And Jake doesn’t disabuse him of that.”

On Thursday, several officials in the Biden administration pushed back on the idea that Mr. Sullivan was offering a lasting view of his thoughts on the Middle East. Instead, they said, Mr. Sullivan was offering a snapshot of a region that appeared calm after years of war, regime changes and refugee crises.

One senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the administration’s process in the aftermath of the attacks, said that no expert could have predicted that Hamas would invade Israel, overrun defense forces, kill civilians and take hundreds hostage.

Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said in an email that the social media criticism swirling around one sentence uttered (or written) by Mr. Sullivan amounts to “a lazy take.”

She pointed out that Mr. Sullivan had logged countless hours on the issue, including by meeting with Ron Dermer, Israel’s minister of strategic affairs, two weeks before submitting the Foreign Affairs essay. Mr. Sullivan, she and other officials noted, traveled to Israel and to the West Bank earlier this year to work on “a major Palestinian component” of the normalization process, which was also an emphasis of his travel to Saudi Arabia in August.

“While the world has changed — as it often does — the past two weeks only underscored the importance of building on the approach to the region that we already had, like building relationships that can be relied upon to solve this crisis or the next one,” Ms. Watson wrote.

Mr. Sullivan declined to comment for this article.

But his supporters noted an important caveat toward the end of both versions of his essay, which is titled “The Sources of American Power” — apparently an allusion to an oft-cited Foreign Affairs essay, “The Sources of Soviet Conduct,” which was written in 1947 at the start of the Cold War.

“The United States has been surprised in the past,” Mr. Sullivan wrote, noting the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 and Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. And, he added, “it will likely be surprised in the future, no matter how hard the government works to anticipate what is coming.”

Divisions over how to discuss the conflict in the Middle East have frayed yearslong relationships between collectors and artists. On Friday, Nicole Eisenman and Nan Goldin criticized the magazine’s owner for terminating Velasco, who had been its editor in chief for six years, and said they would no longer work with Artforum.

“I have never lived through a more chilling period,” said Goldin, who is one of the most celebrated living photographers and signed the open letter that called for Palestinian liberation and a cease-fire. “People are being blacklisted. People are losing their jobs.”

At least four Artforum editors have resigned after the decision to fire Velasco: Zack Hatfield, a senior editor; Emily LaBarge, a freelance editor; Kate Sutton, an associate editor; and Chloe Wyma, a senior editor. On social media, Hatfield posted that Velasco’s firing “is unacceptable and bodes ominously for the future of the magazine”; Wyma wrote that it “violates everything I had cherished about the magazine and makes my work there untenable.”

In addition, nearly 50 Artforum employees and contributors have signed a letter demanding that Velasco be reinstated, saying his termination “not only carries chilling implications for Artforum’s editorial independence but disaffirms the very mission of the magazine: to provide a forum for multiple perspectives and cultural debate.” A spokeswoman for Penske Media Corporation, which owns Artforum, said on Saturday afternoon that the magazine had not seen the letter.

After the magazine published an open letter on Oct. 19 that did not initially mention the attack by Hamas that killed more than 1,400 Israelis, there was a backlash among some readers."
377,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/world/middleeast/hamas-russia-moscow.html,"The delegation of the Palestinian military group was led by Moussa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official, who met with Mikhail Bogdanov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, Hamas said in a statement.

The two sides have discussed the release of foreign hostages from the Gaza Strip, the Russian foreign ministry said, according to RIA Novosti, a Russian state news agency. They also discussed the evacuation of Russians and other foreigners from the region. In its statement, Hamas praised Mr. Putin’s position on the conflict and the active efforts of Russian diplomacy.

Since Hamas’s terrorist attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, Russia has kept a conspicuous distance from the conflict. Days after, in his first comments about the war, Mr. Putin called it “a clear example of the United States’ failed policy in the Middle East.”

In subsequent comments, Mr. Putin continued to accuse the United States of monopolizing the efforts to resolve the conflict and of neglecting the fundamental political issues that are preventing its resolution. He also called for an immediate cease-fire and the resumption of talks in the framework of the U.N.-approved two-state solution to the conflict.

But as the United States engaged in an intense flurry of talks with regional powers, presenting itself as the main power broker in the Middle East, Russia risked its assumed role as one of the major international powers with enough clout to be relevant in all major crises.

Recently, Russia has been trying to catch up. Last week, Mr. Putin called all major leaders in the region, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. Mr. Bogdanov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, met with Hamas leadership in Qatar this week, according to Tass, the Russian state news agency. The meetings in Moscow on Thursday built on these efforts.

Alexandra Appelberg, an editor with the Detaly news outlet in Israel, said that “Russia is trying to demonstrate that the West’s plan to isolate it following the invasion of Ukraine has failed and that it plays an important role.”

According to Ms. Appelberg, Russia has “practically no real levers” that can allow Moscow to influence the situation, but that it might want to “raise its prestige in the Arab world.”

Russia has historically capitalized on its ability to speak to all major parties in the ongoing conflict. One year after Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, Mr. Putin met with Khaled Meshaal, then the group’s leader, in Moscow. Despite its own traumatic history with terrorism, Russia has never designated Hamas as a terrorist group.

During a meeting with Russian religious leaders in the Kremlin on Wednesday, Mr. Putin offered his condolences to Israeli citizens and said that Russia “knows firsthand what international terrorism is all about.”

But he also criticized Israel, saying that “the fight against terrorism cannot be conducted on the notorious principle of collective responsibility resulting in the deaths of the elderly, women, children, entire families.”

Mr. Bogdanov also met with his Iranian counterpart, Ali Bagheri Kani, on Thursday. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said that the two sides acknowledged the need “to stop armed hostilities in the Gaza Strip and around it.”

378,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/us/politics/republican-jewish-coalition-meeting.html,"For years, the annual meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition has been a routine stop on the presidential primary trail, an opportunity for would-be presidents to demonstrate their foreign-policy credentials while plying donors with requisite one-liners.

But nothing is routine this time.

With an escalating conflict in Israel that threatens to spread across the region and a rise in tensions and antisemitism in the United States, the meeting will be like none of the others in the organization’s decades-long history. When Republican officials, lawmakers and candidates gather in Las Vegas this weekend, they will come together at a moment of unique peril for Israel and, many attendees believe, for American Jewry.

Security has been tightened and seats added to accommodate a wave of new attendees who decided to come after the Oct. 7 attacks. An empty Shabbat table will sit in the middle of the room, honoring the more than 200 people being held hostage in Gaza. Along with the American national anthem, attendees will sing Hatikvah, the Israeli national anthem, and offer special prayers for those who are missing and wounded.

And while the overall tone will be subdued, members of the organization said they expected nothing short of full-throated, unequivocal support for Israel and the protection of Jews in America from the 2024 Republican field.

“I would venture half the room, if not more than half, has relatives who are in the I.D.F.,” said Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary under President George W. Bush and a member of the Republican Jewish Coalition’s board, referring to the Israel Defense Forces. “They don’t want to see a single weak knee, elbow or joint. They want to see support for a nation that’s in trauma against the modern-day equivalent of Nazism.”

All eight major candidates running for the Republican nomination, including the dominant front-runner, Donald J. Trump, are expected to attend, a reflection of how the attacks have thrust foreign policy into the center of American politics. On Wednesday, the House passed a resolution vowing to give the Israeli government whatever security assistance it needs, the first legislation taken up by the new speaker, Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana.

Speakers at the Las Vegas gathering will also include Senator John Thune, the second-ranking Senate Republican; Gov. Sarah Sanders of Arkansas; Gov. Joe Lombardo of Nevada; and a number of congressional lawmakers.

“The eyes of the world are going to be on this event this weekend,” said the chairman of the organization, Matt Brooks, who expects the entire leadership of the Republican Party to “articulate an unwavering commitment to the people of Israel and our security.”

Eric Levine, a New York lawyer who is also on the board of the organization, said that he hoped to hear the candidates affirm America’s commitment to Israel, but that he also wanted to hear their plans for dealing with Iran. “I want them to tie together, in a meaningful way, the China, Russia, Iran axis of evil,” he said.

Mr. Levine, who has backed Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina in the G.O.P. presidential primary, said that many in the organization believed that Iran should be “punished” and were looking for the right candidate to do it. “It’s time,” he added, “to set up a red line that really means something.”

While President Biden’s speech condemning the “evil” perpetrated by Hamas and his wartime visit won surprising praise from Jewish conservatives, Republican presidential candidates tried to blame the president in the days after the attack. Many drew a tenuous connection between the surprise assault and a recent hostage release deal between the United States and Iran.

As part of a complex deal for the release of five Americans held in Tehran, the Biden administration agreed in August to free up $6 billion in frozen Iranian oil revenue funds for humanitarian purposes. The money was transferred to a restricted account in Doha, Qatar, and the administration has emphasized that the money could be used only for “food, medicine, medical equipment that would not have a dual military use.” None of the money had been distributed at the time of the attack, administration officials said.

While nearly all the candidates back broad military and financial support for Israel, Vivek Ramaswamy, who has cast his campaign as “America First 2.0,” has argued that American aid should be contingent on a review of Israel’s invasion plans.

The candidates have also tussled over their rhetoric. At a campaign event this month, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said the U.S. should not accept any refugees from Gaza because they are “all antisemitic.” Nikki Haley, who also opposes accepting refugees from the area, pushed back on his claim, saying, “America has always been sympathetic to the fact that you can separate civilians from terrorists.”

In recent days, several of the candidates have turned their attention to the home front, with Mr. Trump and others saying they would revoke the student visas of Hamas sympathizers. Mr. DeSantis ordered state universities to ban a pro-Palestinian student organization. Ms. Haley said she would change the official federal definition of antisemitism to include anti-Zionism, allowing her to pull a university’s tax-exempt status if it fails to crack down on anti-Israel organizations. Mr. Scott said he would withhold Pell grants from universities that failed to stamp out antisemitism.

Mr. Trump has spent several weeks trying to repair the damage from an early comment in which he criticized Israeli intelligence and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as weak just days after the attack. Mr. DeSantis and Mr. Scott strongly denounced those remarks, and Mr. Trump spent several days walking them back.

Mr. Trump’s record, however, appeals to many attendees. As president, he brokered the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries; moved the United States embassy to Jerusalem; and ended decades of U.S. opposition to Israeli settlements. He also cut aid for Palestinians, and his administration took steps to designate a campaign to boycott Israel as antisemitic.

Marc Goldman, a Boca Raton, Fla., investor on the group’s board, said he backed Mr. Trump in 2020 and was likely to support him again.

“When you really look at the fact of the matter,” Mr. Goldman said, “what Trump did in his four years for America and for Israel was way bigger, way more, than anyone else has accomplished.”"
379,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-israel-hamas-gaza-war.html,"As the curtain rose this week on an annual investment forum hosted by the Saudi crown prince, dancers in silver bodysuits undulated through the crowd, and a teenage boy in a sequined suit sang an operatic solo while an image of a white dove — a symbol of peace — flew across the screens surrounding the darkened room.

For the international bankers, executives and officials who had gathered in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, to make deals, the war raging in Gaza and Israel felt like a distant backdrop. Instead, when speakers took the stage, they praised Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plan to remake Saudi Arabia and focused on the future: artificial intelligence, longevity science, renewable energy.

“I appreciate that many of you journeyed far to gather here, especially with the challenging times that we see in different parts of the world,” said Yasir al-Rumayyan, governor of the kingdom’s $700 billion sovereign wealth fund — making a single, oblique reference to the conflict in his opening speech at the Future Investment Initiative conference on Tuesday. “While today’s world seems uncertain, we continue with our mandate to inspire.”

Since gunmen from the Palestinian armed group Hamas in Gaza staged a surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, the threat of a widening war has loomed over the Middle East. Israel has laid siege to the Gaza Strip and unleashed a fierce bombardment.

That has prompted protests across the region, reinvigorating vocal Arab support for the Palestinian cause — including among many Saudi citizens.

Yet Saudi officials have made it clear that they are determined to prevent all of that from casting a pall over Prince Mohammed’s plans for the kingdom, which include reshaping the economy to reduce dependence on oil and turning the country into a global hub for business and tourism."
380,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/us/politics/us-defense-alliances-israel-ukraine.html,"From around the world, they come to the halls of power in Washington seeking one thing: a commitment from the American government to protect their countries in a time of rising geopolitical crises.

In recent months, leaders and diplomats from a growing number of nations have signed security pacts with the United States, upgraded military ties and weapons purchases or have begun negotiating potential new defense treaties and arrangements.

The countries include Ukraine, at war with Russia; Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, eager to stave off Iran; and Japan, South Korea, Australia and the Philippines, anxious about China and North Korea’s military ambitions. Frightened by Russia’s aggression, Finland joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in April, while Sweden is on the brink of membership.

The Biden administration is surging munitions to Israel for airstrikes in Gaza and has sent two aircraft carrier groups to the eastern Mediterranean. Israel and the United States have a series of agreements on military aid.

The push around the world for the United States to be all things to all partners in terms of defense is stronger than at any time since the end of the Cold War. But many Americans are resisting having their nation play that role, at least partly because of the political impact of the disastrous U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

And critics say the devastating attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7 that killed about 1,400 Israelis underscore the fact that defense agreements do not create a real foundation for peace and deterrence.

That opposition to the United States being what President Biden and other U.S. officials call “the indispensable nation” — they mean the security guarantor around the world — has some roots in traditional liberal antiwar values, but it is also tied to surprising ideological shifts of recent years. Many Republican voters, once proponents of a Cold War and antiterrorism global military footprint, now support isolationist and pro-Russia politicians, notably former President Donald J. Trump.

Some Republican lawmakers are now trying to halt aid to Ukraine, and progressive Democrats have denounced the ongoing Israeli airstrikes that have killed thousands of Palestinians. All of that sets up a potential battle over a new White House request for $105 billion of military aid that would go mostly to Ukraine and Israel."
381,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/arts/television/dave-chappelle-button-pushing-comedy.html,"It’s an understandable complaint. Of course, Chappelle seeks out contentious subjects — his lawyerly explanation of the antisemitism of Kanye West on “Saturday Night Live” last year does not help his cause in this current controversy — and no one exaggerates their own victimhood more. He’s still saying, “Any minute they’re going to cancel me” despite the fact that he’s performing for huge crowds and has another Netflix special on the way. But the media attention that Chappelle’s comedy gets is obsessive, polarized and often tediously literal.

It brings to mind one of the most memorable bits of this century, his 2004 joke about Ja Rule being asked to weigh in on Sept. 11. Mocking how our media ask celebrities to be sober authorities making sense of tragic events, Chappelle said, “I want some answers that Ja Rule might not have right now.”

This joke has aged tremendously well. Social media has only amplified the opinions of the Ja Rules of the world. The algorithms that run our feeds are making sure you have Justin Bieber and Gigi Hadid to explain the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Now every corporation and middle school seems to have its own foreign policy. Comedians have been perhaps the most outspoken of artists, with Sarah Silverman and Amy Schumer consistently commenting on Israel and antisemitism on social media, earning praise and condemnation. The comic Bassem Youssef went viral for his appearance on Piers Morgan’s show. Obviously, in a democratic society, it’s important for people to feel free to speak out on matters of gravity, and an emotional response on this issue is not only understandable but necessary. But it’s also reasonable to think that you should want some answers that Dave Chappelle might not have right now.

Chappelle is a tricky case, because since his Ja Rule joke, he has embraced the sober truth-teller role, telling magnetic stories that sometimes end in lessons, not punchlines. His take on Israel has been mostly sober, but other comics are incorporating the issue into their work. Matt Ruby put 10 minutes of his jokes from a club set online, defending himself by saying, “This is how Jews handle crisis.” The German stand-up Shahak Shapira released a 25-minute special, “Baklavas From Gaza.” Both sounded like rough drafts, but they seem motivated less by a blunt interest in changing hearts and minds than in comforting them.

The seeming hopelessness of the conflict in the Middle East has always drawn comics looking to push buttons. In one of the most high-risk “Saturday Night Live” monologues ever, Louis C.K. likened Israelis and Palestinians to his daughters fighting, with him as America trying to mediate. Since he had sandwiched this metaphor between a joke about his “mild racism” and another about trying to understand pedophilia, he managed the feat of making the subject seem safe."
382,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/11/world/europe/zelensky-visits-nato-surprise.html,"President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine made a surprise visit to NATO headquarters on Wednesday, urging the military alliance to maintain its flow of weapons to his country for its war against Russia, even as much of the West turns its attention to the brutal outbreak of violence in Israel.

Top NATO officials sought to reassure Mr. Zelensky, pledging more than $2 billion in additional military aid to be delivered before Ukraine’s winter sets in.

“Your fight is our fight, your security is our security, and your values are our values,” Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, said at the start of two days of meetings among the alliance’s defense chiefs. “And we will stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes.”

But Mr. Zelensky later said that “of course, everybody’s afraid” that Western assistance would dwindle as the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza continues."
383,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/us/politics/us-strikes-iran-syria-iraq.html,"The United States carried out two airstrikes against facilities used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and its proxies in eastern Syria early Friday in retaliation for a flurry of recent rocket and drone attacks against American forces in Iraq and Syria.

The strikes by Air Force F-16 jets, against a weapons storage facility and an ammunition storage facility, were intended to send a strong signal to Iran to rein in the attacks the Biden administration has blamed on Tehran’s proxies in Syria and Iraq without escalating the conflict in the Middle East, U.S. officials said. The targets, while limited in number, represent an escalation in striking facilities used by Iran’s own forces in the region, not just the militias in Iraq and Syria that Tehran helps to arm, train and equip.

“These precision self-defense strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups,” Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said in a statement.

“The United States does not seek conflict and has no intention nor desire to engage in further hostilities, but these Iranian-backed attacks against U.S. forces are unacceptable and must stop,” Mr. Austin said.

Since Hamas’s surprise attack against Israel on Oct. 7, President Biden and his aides have sought to contain the war between Israel and Hamas, and prevent it from spilling over into a regional conflict with Iran and its proxies in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.

To that end, the United States has deployed two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean near Israel and dozens of additional warplanes to the Persian Gulf region to deter Iran and its proxies in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq from engaging in a regional war. The Pentagon has also rushed additional Patriot antimissile batteries and other air defenses to several Gulf nations to protect U.S. troops and bases in the region.

But with the near daily attacks against U.S. forces over the past 10 days — the Pentagon’s tally climbed to at least 19 by late Thursday — pressure had been mounting on the United States to respond militarily."
384,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/opinion/putin-russia-gaza-israel.html,"If media attention is in short supply, so too are munitions. Mr. Biden has vowed that the United States can support both Israel’s and Ukraine’s security needs, and is asking Congress for $105 billion in emergency funding to cover them. But Israel may eventually need weapons that are now running short in Ukraine, including armed drones and artillery rounds. Trapped in a war of attrition of its own making, Russia must be relishing the appearance of a new and demanding conflict for the United States, draining the strength of its adversaries.

What’s more, the war in Gaza threatens to postpone — if not derail — the Biden administration’s efforts to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Even before this month, Washington had the herculean task of reconciling the parties’ disparate demands related to U.S. security guarantees, a Saudi civilian nuclear program and the fate of the Palestinians. The new cycle of violence now threatens the initiative altogether.

That would please officials in Moscow, who have always viewed the Abraham Accords, a set of deals between Israel and several Arab states struck in 2020 that paved the way for the Saudi normalization process, as an American project that sidelines Russia. Its faltering offers Russia more than just the sheer pleasure of seeing America struggle. Moscow has its own designs for nuclear cooperation with Saudi Arabia and also hopes to thwart the maturing of an Arab-Israeli defense partnership against Iran, an increasingly close Russian partner.

But Russia’s biggest gain may come in the court of global opinion. Moscow’s messaging on the conflict — the Kremlin has refused to call the attack on Oct. 7 “terrorism” and blamed the escalation on Western policy mistakes — aligns Russia with public sentiment across much of the Middle East. Silhouetted behind platitudes about peace, calls for the protection of all civilians and acknowledgments of Israel’s right to self-defense are hints of a pro-Palestinian position. In Russian media coverage, the display of Palestinian suffering in Gaza has taken center stage and Russian officials have spotlighted humanitarian concerns while avoiding any direct censure of Hamas. Moscow’s affinity for the Palestinian cause is not new, but the Kremlin has become more explicit about it.

Yet Russian aspirations go beyond the Middle East. Styling itself as David to the Western Goliath, Russia has framed its war against Ukraine as an “anticolonial” fight to end the West’s global dominance — tapping into powerful grievances held across the developing world about Western arrogance and hypocrisy. The Kremlin’s response to the war in Gaza, putting distance between itself and Washington’s unequivocal pro-Israel stance, is designed to exploit those feelings further. For Russia, increasing disillusion with the West and even winning over new sympathizers for its challenge to the global order would be advances worth the risk of upsetting Israel. That such a position plays into tensions in Europe is a pleasing byproduct."
385,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/us/politics/us-israel-gaza-ground-invasion.html,"The Biden administration has asked Israel to delay a ground invasion of Gaza for a few days to give the United States more time to put air defense batteries, fighter planes and other military assets in place to protect American troops, U.S. officials said.

U.S. officials have been pushing Israel for a delay for multiple reasons. They include giving more time to negotiate the release of hostages held in Gaza, allowing more aid into the region and providing the Israeli military with time to refine its military objectives and potentially move away from a grinding urban fight that would incur large casualties.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has held off on a land invasion in the nearly three weeks since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7. The Israeli government says more than 1,400 civilians and soldiers were killed, and 200 hostages were taken back to Gaza.

The prime minister’s office declined to comment. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu said the Israeli military was still preparing for a ground operation in the Gaza Strip. “I will not spell out when, how, how much,” he said. “I also won’t detail all the considerations we’re taking into account, most of them totally unknown to the public.”

Biden administration officials say they still support Israel’s ground invasion and Israel’s goal of eradicating Hamas.

American officials say it will take them a few more days to get many of those new antimissile batteries in place. Another U.S. official said the United States already had some air defense assets in the region that have been protecting troops from attacks in Syria.

The Financial Times reported earlier on the request to delay the ground invasion to give time to get the air defense assets in place.

The Biden administration has rushed two aircraft carriers and additional troops to the eastern Mediterranean near Israel to deter Iran and its proxies in the region from engaging in a regional war. A U.S. Navy warship in the northern Red Sea last Thursday shot down at least three cruise missiles and several drones launched from Yemen that the Pentagon said might have been headed toward Israel.

“I believe there is concern that our bases in Syria and Iraq, especially Syria, could be attacked by a wave of drones and it could overwhelm the defenses currently there,” said Mick Mulroy, a former defense official and retired C.I.A. officer.

American officials have repeatedly raised with Israelis their concerns that Iran or Hezbollah, the Lebanese political and militia group backed by Tehran, might open a second front after Israel commits much of its military to eliminating Hamas in Gaza. For now, the United States has assessed that Iran and Hezbollah, whose leaders did not know Hamas was planning such a large-scale attack, want to remain on the sidelines.

But a major ground invasion of Gaza, particularly one that kills a large numbers of Palestinians, could change Iran’s or Hezbollah’s calculations.

The American officials have urged Mr. Netanyahu’s war cabinet to give Washington more time to place antimissile batteries to protect both Israel and American troops in the region, according to several American officials.

While the air defense batteries may not be crucial to the Israeli government’s calculations, one senior American official said the Israelis needed more time to train their troops before they headed into urban warfare and into the underground tunnels below Gaza.

Washington’s main concern is protecting American troops. But the United States also believes that Israel may not have the capability to respond to a two-front war. The assembled antimissile systems, and the weapons carried aboard the aircraft carrier group in the Eastern Mediterranean, could prove a critical deterrent against Iran.

“The United States does not seek conflict with Iran,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said at the United Nations on Tuesday. “We do not want this war to widen. But if Iran or its proxies attack U.S. personnel anywhere, make no mistake: We will defend our people, we will defend our security — swiftly and decisively.”

Israel has responded to the Hamas attack with a relentless artillery and bombing campaign that has killed 5,700 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry.

386,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/world/middleeast/al-jazeera-journalist-gaza-family-killed.html,"At least four family members of a prominent Al Jazeera journalist in Gaza were killed, the news organization said on Wednesday.

The network said the wife, son, daughter and infant grandson of Wael al-Dahdouh, the Gaza bureau chief of Al Jazeera’s Arabic-language service, were killed at the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, where they had been sheltering.

In a statement, Al Jazeera’s parent company, the Al Jazeera Media Network, blamed an Israeli airstrike and condemned the killings as an “indiscriminate assault.” It said Mr. al-Dahdouh’s family had taken refuge at the Nuseirat camp after Israel called for civilians to move south.

“Al Jazeera is deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of our colleagues in Gaza and hold the Israeli authorities responsible for their security,” the network said.

A spokesperson for the Israeli military said in an email that it had targeted “Hamas terrorist infrastructure” in the area, adding that its forces take “feasible precautions to mitigate civilian casualties.”

Mr. al-Dahdouh had spent Wednesday reporting from Gaza City and learned of his family’s deaths live on air, an Al Jazeera editor, Mohamed Moawad, said in posts on social media.

Al Jazeera identified two of the deceased as Mr. al-Dahdouh’s teenage son, Mahmoud, and his young daughter, Sham. Footage aired by its Arabic-language channel on Wednesday showed him crouching over his son’s body, stroking his face, inside what the network identified as Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah.

Photos also showed Mr. al-Dahdouh clutching what appeared to be his daughter’s small, shrouded body, looking down at her bloodied face in anguish.

In a translated interview aired by Al Jazeera’s English-language channel, Mr. al-Dahdouh, his face wet with tears, said no one was safe in Gaza.

Mr. al-Dahdouh is “the voice of Palestinians in Gaza,” Hoda Abdel-Hamid, an Al Jazeera correspondent, wrote in a live update for the outlet’s coverage of the war, adding, “ask anyone when you walk around the streets there.”

The Committee to Protect Journalists, a watchdog group, said on Wednesday that the war between Israel and Hamas has “taken a severe toll on journalists,” and that those in Gaza faced particularly high risks. At least 24 journalists — 20 of them Palestinian — were confirmed to have died in the conflict since Oct. 7, it said.

Among them is Issam Abdallah, a Reuters cameraman who was killed earlier this month amid clashes on Lebanon’s southern border with Israel that injured six other journalists from Reuters, Al Jazeera and Agence France-Presse.

Last year, the Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, an Al Jazeera reporter known across the Middle East, was shot in the head and killed in the West Bank city of Jenin. Four months later, the Israeli Army acknowledged for the first time that she was likely killed by an Israeli soldier, but stopped short of definitively accepting responsibility for her death."
387,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/us/politics/mike-johnson-shutdown-ukraine-israel.html,"Newly installed Speaker Mike Johnson is confronting a multitude of crises during his first days in office, chief among them a deadline just weeks away to avert a government shutdown and an urgent request from President Biden for a behemoth $105 billion aid bill for Israel and Ukraine.

They are two of the issues that have most bitterly divided the House Republican conference and helped lead to the ouster of his predecessor. Now it falls to Mr. Johnson, a fourth-term congressman who has never served in a top leadership position before, to try to keep his anti-spending party united and the government open — all in a matter of weeks.

The previous speaker, Kevin McCarthy, found it impossible to corral recalcitrant Republicans to pass legislation to keep federal funding flowing and prevent a politically and economically damaging shutdown. At the last moment, he turned to Democrats to push through a bill to extend the deadline through Nov. 17, a move that prompted hard-right Republicans to force him out.

Mr. Johnson was among a majority of Republicans who opposed that stopgap spending bill. He has also opposed continued aid for Ukraine for its war against Russian aggression, and he said on Wednesday that he wanted to see “conditions” imposed on additional U.S. aid.

As he sought the speakership in recent days, Mr. Johnson has also suggested that he would back a temporary measure to keep government funding flowing through January or April to allow more time to pass all 12 individual annual spending bills, a key demand of the hard right. But he has not said what spending levels he would favor.

In the days leading up to the government shutdown deadline in September, Mr. McCarthy put forward a stopgap measure that severely slashed spending. Twenty-one conservative lawmakers opposed it, tanking the bill and declaring that they would not vote for a temporary funding measure under any circumstances.

Representative Ralph Norman of South Carolina, a member of the Freedom Caucus, suggested that the hard-right flank of the party would be inclined to give Mr. Johnson more leeway on spending than they gave Mr. McCarthy because they trust his conservative bona fides.

“He doesn’t start from the position of way up and go up,” Mr. Norman said of Mr. Johnson and federal spending. “He starts from the position of up and goes down.”

“The problems with McCarthy,” he added, “started with one word: trustworthy.”

Yet Mr. Norman also said he wanted to see a temporary spending bill that slashed spending to prepandemic levels — something that could never pass the Democratic-controlled Senate or be signed by Mr. Biden. That would violate the agreement Mr. McCarthy struck in June with the president to suspend the debt ceiling and cap federal spending.

“Extremist funding bills that make cuts way below the bipartisan June agreement will not fly,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader. “If Speaker Johnson tries to send those cuts over here, they’re not going to happen. They’ll be dead on arrival. All they will do is waste more time at a moment when every day counts.”

Mr. Schumer continued: “I told Speaker Johnson the exact same thing I told Speaker McCarthy: In a divided government, the only way we’ll fund the government or pass supplemental is bipartisanship.”

Mr. Johnson will face another test as Congress considers the Biden administration’s funding request for Israel and Ukraine — a $105 billion package that could end up getting folded into a stopgap funding measure. The Senate, where the measure is far more popular, is holding a hearing on the aid package next week, and Mr. Johnson was at the White House on Thursday to be briefed on it.

In September, when lawmakers were racing to try to avoid a government shutdown, a bipartisan Senate stopgap plan included $6 billion for Ukraine. But Mr. McCarthy stripped the aid from his plan, recognizing the sharp decline in Republican support for sending more federal dollars to Kyiv. Democrats swallowed the plan in the interest of keeping the government open, arguing that Congress would return to the issue and pass a larger aid package later in the year.

It is not clear how Mr. Johnson, who has voted repeatedly against sending additional aid to Ukraine, plans to handle the emergency spending request. He has expressed strong support for aiding Israel in its fight against Hamas.

And asked by a reporter on Wednesday night if he supported sending additional aid to Ukraine, Mr. Johnson replied, “We all do.”

But he added that his backing would not be absolute. “We’re going to have conditions on that,” Mr. Johnson said. “We want accountability and we want objectives that are clear from the White House.”

The hard-right members of his party have already declared the measure dead on arrival.

“For the House GOP under Speaker Mike Johnson this is an obvious HARD NO,” Representative Chip Roy of Texas, an influential anti-spending conservative, wrote on social media. “We will not join Israel and Ukraine, we will not throw money at the border, & all supplementals must be paid for — as a starter. Game on.”

Russia and China vetoed a resolution put forth by the United States that did not call for a cease-fire and that stated Israel had the right to defend itself. The other resolution, from Russia, called for a cease-fire but failed to receive the nine votes required. Russia and the United States have clashed on resolutions since the conflict began, with both nations employing veto power to block the council from acting.

António Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations, on Wednesday also addressed the controversy around his comments a day earlier that Hamas’s attack on Israel “did not happen in a vacuum.”

“I am shocked by the misinterpretations by some of my statement yesterday in the Security Council — as if I was justifying acts of terror by Hamas,” Mr. Guterres said to reporters outside the council chamber. “This is false. It was the opposite.”

But Hamas did get a vote of support on Wednesday from the leader of Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Hamas was “not a terror organization” but a group fighting “to protect their land and citizens.” Mr. Erdogan said he did not “excuse any acts targeting civilians, including Israeli civilians,” but condemned what he called Israeli brutality against Palestinians.

In Washington, President Biden offered another full-throated declaration of support for Israel during a news conference at the White House, saying that “Israel has the right and I would add responsibility to respond to the slaughter of their people.”

But the president said that Hamas did not represent all Palestinians, and that “Israel has to do everything in its power, as difficult as it is, to protect innocent civilians.”

The United States has pledged full support to Israel as it fights Hamas, though it has encouraged the Israelis to hold off on a ground invasion, citing the safety of the hostages, the need to deliver aid to Gaza, and concerns that Israel does not have a clear military strategy.

On Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said the country’s military was still preparing for a ground operation in the Gaza Strip. “I will not spell out when, how, how much,” he said. “I also won’t detail all the considerations we’re taking into account, most of them totally unknown to the public.”

In a prime time address to Israels, Mr. Netanyahu indicated that he was already thinking of the political battles that lie ahead. He conceded that he would have to provide answers for how Israel was caught off guard by the stunning Hamas attack, but stopped short of explicitly taking responsibility.

“This disaster will be fully looked into,” he said. “Everyone will need to give answers — including myself. But all of this will only happen after the war.”"
389,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/world/middleeast/saudi-israel-gaza-war.html,"The startling clash between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which threatens to become a regional conflict, jeopardizes the months-long effort by President Biden and his top aides to push Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel.

Even before the assault by Palestinian militants of Hamas on Israeli towns on Saturday morning, American officials, including Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, had warned that the complex diplomacy over normalization might not bear fruit. On Saturday, Mr. Blinken was at the White House making calls to foreign counterparts on the new conflict. He and other U.S. officials were focused on quelling the war, not on diplomacy over Saudi-Israel normalization.

Saudi Arabia has made significant demands of the United States, including a mutual defense treaty. But American and Arab officials from the region have said in private conversations in recent weeks that they thought the hardest part of the talks would be getting the right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to grant enough concessions to the Palestinians to satisfy Saudi and American leaders.

With Israel now saying it was at war with Gaza, the prospect of such concessions looks even dimmer.

A statement on Saturday from Saudi Foreign Ministry emphasized the plight of the Palestinians, saying the kingdom had warned repeatedly “of the dangers of the explosion of the situation as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights and the repetition of systemic provocations against its sanctities.”"

My name is Gershom Gorenberg. I am a historian and journalist. And I live in Jerusalem, Israel. Netanyahu has been in office for 13 out of the last 14 years. The priorities of this government are really striking because the central priority of the government has been what it calls judicial reform. That’s a euphemism.

Since the beginning of the war, Israelis have been asking themselves, how did this happen? One easy answer to that question is that Hamas doesn’t accept our existence here, that it’s barbaric, that it wants to kill us. But the real question for Israelis, when they say, how did this happen is, how did our government let this happen? And the answer to that question is that the government was complacent, overconfident, committed to misconceptions, and has failed. And Prime Minister Netanyahu is personally responsible for that, and he has to go.

And that has really been its central priority, and in turn, set off a huge wave of protests in the country.

But what we have to understand is that Netanyahu’s blindness to the danger from Hamas and Gaza has a longer history, and that’s rooted in a strategic choice that Netanyahu has made since he returned to power and has followed since then. Dating back to 2007, the extreme Islamic Hamas organization seized control of the Gaza Strip, pushing aside the autonomous Palestinian Authority.

The other two things that have really marked this government has been large transfers of funds to the ultra-orthodox sector and support of the West Bank Settlement Project. From what the public can see, defense, national security have taken a second seat to those other priorities.

So the situation that resulted from that is that Hamas rules the Gaza Strip, the small enclave along the Mediterranean Coast at the south end of Israel. And the Palestinian Authority rules the autonomous areas in the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority has been a proponent in the past of a two-state outcome, a two-state agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

Netanyahu’s policy, over the years, has been with zigs and zags publicly, but essentially opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state. And he has treated this split between Hamas in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority government in the West Bank as a political advantage for Israel, as something that makes it more difficult to reach a two-state outcome. And his policy has been to allow this split to continue.

The government, very clearly, was focused on the West Bank, on protection of settlements in the West Bank, and on the northern border with Lebanon and Hezbollah, and was complacent regarding the threat from Gaza. And the military misreading of the situation is derived from the political misreading, stemming from an attitude that with the split with Hamas in Gaza and with the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, that Israel could indefinitely continue to manage the conflict safely, rather than seeking any kind of diplomatic resolution of the conflict with the Palestinians.

All of that, obviously, has literally gone up in flames on and after October 7. It is a subject of pointed public controversy within Israel that Netanyahu has not accepted any responsibility for a catastrophic failure in defense of the country.

Netanyahu does not have the trust and confidence of the country and has not shown himself capable of dealing with the situation. He appears to have been too concerned with his own affairs and with his bid to solidify his power and not sufficiently concerned with the good of the country.

The expression in Hebrew that people often use is, he’s worried about the King and not the Kingdom, that is to say about the leader and not about the state. And I think that there are circumstances which demand the change of a leader during wartime. Britain was much better off trading in Chamberlain for Churchill, even though it was the middle of a war.

So the first expectation I would have of Netanyahu is to resign and go home. For years, I felt that the attitude of the government toward the conflict could be compared to the attitude of the man who jumped out of a 100-story building. And when he passed the 20th story, somebody yelled out, how’s it going? And he said, so far, great. We’ve passed that point, and it’s not going great. And that policy has failed, and we need a completely new direction. And Netanyahu is not the man to lead us in that new direction.

The humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepened yesterday as Israel said it had conducted “wide-scale” strikes and again warned residents in Gaza to flee south ahead of a possible invasion.

Fuel shortages in the enclave have grown so dire that UNRWA, the U.N. agency that helps Palestinians, said that it might have to start shutting down its operations. Israel has so far refused to allow in more fuel, arguing that it could fall into the hands of Hamas.

With shortages of fuel, medicine and other supplies, the World Health Organization said that 12 of Gaza’s 35 hospitals were not functioning, and that seven major hospitals were well over capacity.

E.U. leaders were to meet in Brussels today to call for a “humanitarian pause” that would allow more aid deliveries into Gaza. In Washington, President Biden said the U.S. was working with partners in the region to speed aid to those who need it most. The U.N. said Gaza needs at least 100 aid trucks a day. Sixty-two trucks have arrived since Saturday."
392,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-defense-hamas-gaza.html,"Hamas’s attack on Saturday took Israeli intelligence officials by surprise, particularly the methods the militants used to enter and leave Israel, according to a senior defense official familiar with the information collected about the group.

The broad attack, mostly successful from Hamas’s point of view, revealed some significant failures by the Israeli defense establishment. It also may change Israel’s overall strategic approach to Hamas and the Gaza Strip, said the official, who asked not to be identified when discussing security matters.

And that could have a far-reaching effect on the entire Middle East.

Until now, Israel has contained Hamas and Gaza with a strategy that hinged on an intelligence network that would warn against Hamas’s moves, and on the power of the Israeli Army to repel a ground invasion by Hamas. In the Hamas attack on Saturday, these two safeguards failed.

Israel is traditionally perceived as the strongest intelligence power in the region, with extensive coverage of the Gaza Strip. And in recent months, Israeli intelligence did repeatedly warn that a military conflict could flare up because Iran and affiliated militias have perceived Israel as weakened by the nation’s profound divisions over the judicial overhaul being pursued by the ultraright governing coalition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to four senior defense officials."
393,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/world/middleeast/gaza-diaspora-families.html,"The legacy of displacement also loomed large inside Israel, said Nathan Thrall, author of “A Day in the Life of Abed Salama,” a book about the lives of Palestinians and Israelis. “Beyond the shock and atrocities of the attack, it played to the deepest Israeli fears — that all these Palestinians, who live on the other side of the wall, are going to come back and try to retake their villages and homes,” he said.

On the fifth day of the war, Mr. Abujayyab received devastating news. An Israeli airstrike had crushed an apartment block in the Jabaliya refugee camp, in northern Gaza, killing 45 members of his extended family. The dead included a month-old boy.

“I consider myself a tough person,” Mr. Abujayyab said in a video call the next day, his eyes welling up. “But I had to take a moment and cry it out.”

A split developed inside the family WhatsApp group. His grandmother was still defying the Israeli order to evacuate, even though Israel’s military would soon warn that residents who stayed risked being considered a “a member of a terrorist organization.”

But his sister, Doaa, was less sure. Mr. Abujayyab and his siblings argued about her next move: Stay at her grandmother’s apartment? Or risk the short but dangerous journey south?

Even below the evacuation line, nobody was safe. Mr. Keshawi, the Crisis Group researcher, had moved his family to a friend’s house in southern Gaza. On Saturday an airstrike hit next door, collapsing the roof on top of his 29-year-old son. It fractured his skull and crushed his chest, Mr. Keshawi said by phone. But he survived.

Then Mr. Abujayyab’s grandmother had a close call. Early Friday, the Israeli military ordered the residents in a cluster of 25 apartment blocks near his grandmother, to evacuate. A small drone strike on a rooftop reinforced the message.

Soon after, jets bombed the apartments, blowing out his grandmother’s windows. With his sister, she took off into the night with about 6,000 other people, sleeping on the roadside. Eventually they found shelter at a small hospital run by a relative in southern Gaza.

By Wednesday, the Israeli assault had killed more than 6,500 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in the territory.

A few nights before, two other grandmothers got out of Gaza: Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, who had been kidnapped on Oct. 7 during a massacre at Kibbutz Nir Oz, barely a mile from the fence. Hamas released the two women through Egypt. But their husbands, and more than 200 other captives, remained in Gaza.

Mr. Abujayyab’s sister or grandmother likely didn’t hear that news. They had no power, limited internet and more bombs were falling, his sister said in a voice message to her family.

“There are many reasons you can’t reach us,” she said. “Don’t worry.”"
394,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/us/university-of-pennsylvania-donors-israel-hamas.html,"Since then, some of Penn’s most influential alumni and benefactors — including Mr. Lauder, the former Utah governor Jon Huntsman and the “Law & Order” creator Dick Wolf — have joined Mr. Rowan in pulling funding.

Even before the conference, though, tensions had been simmering at Penn over what some donors viewed as the university’s leftward shift, including a transgender athlete on the women’s swim team and the push for diversity, equity, and inclusion programs by the dean of the business school. They were also concerned about the declining number of Jewish students.

A couple of donors, it turned out, had cut off contributions well before the conference.

“The conservatives have this intersecting set of issues and among them, pro-Israel stuff is one of them,” said Robert Vitalis, a Penn professor who formerly ran the university’s Middle East Center and supported the Palestinian writers. “The conference became a vehicle.”

It is not unusual for donors, unhappy with student activism, to pull back giving. A host of universities have struggled to bridge political and cultural divides among donors, faculty and students. At the University of Texas at Austin, alumni threatened to cut funds over efforts to eliminate the university’s fight song, and at the University of Denver, a plan to give an award to President George W. Bush drew donor ire.

But donors rarely try to topple the leadership so publicly. For many watching this battle, the campaign to wrest control over the university’s direction — its policies, principles and vision for the future — was unsettling.

The donor outcry dismayed pro-Palestinian alumni, who in an Oct. 18 open letter criticized the Penn administration, as well as influential donors, for overlooking the treatment of Palestinians in the ensuing violence.

“Reports from U.N. and W.H.O. experts have highlighted the humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding,” the letter said. “Over a million individuals have been displaced, with countless lives lost or forever altered.”

Administrators at the university declined requests for interviews. But Risa L. Lieberwitz, a Cornell professor who researches academic freedom and faculty governance, said that pressure from donors can undermine public confidence in institutions.

“It’s essential that the university remains independent from donor pressure or influence on the content of work that’s done in the university,” said Ms. Lieberwitz, who is also general counsel for the American Association of University Professors. “The public needs to trust us that we’re doing research or teaching or other educational activities without being pressured to take certain positions.”

A Campus on Edge

When she was inaugurated as president a year ago, Ms. Magill seemed to have the perfect pedigree. As provost at the University of Virginia, she helped develop a version of the Chicago Principles, which are intended to protect freedom of expression on campus.

“Very broadly, I am deeply committed to academic freedom,” Ms. Magill had told The Daily Pennsylvanian, the campus newspaper.

Academic freedom debates had been roiling Penn’s campus. Many students and alumni had demanded action on Amy Wax, the Penn law professor who has said that Black people have “lower cognitive ability” than white people and that the country was “better off” without Asians. The outcome of a faculty hearing considering sanctions has not been announced.

It was against this backdrop that Ms. Magill started receiving complaints about the Palestine Writes Literature Festival, which fell on the weekend of Sept. 22, coinciding in part with Yom Kippur. Organized with the university’s College of Arts and Sciences, the conference featured 120 speakers, many of them literary figures, virtually all pro-Palestinian.

Mr. Lauder, the cosmetics billionaire whose family name is on both a dormitory and a business school program, had visited Ms. Magill to ask that she cancel the conference. Similar complaints, some stopping short of asking for cancellation, came in from national and local Jewish groups and students from Penn Hillel, the Jewish campus organization.

They cited a range of speakers that they considered objectionable. They noted, for instance, the presence of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen, a vocal supporter of the movement to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel, known as B.D.S. And they objected to Roger Waters, the Pink Floyd musician, who had worn a Nazi-like costume in a Berlin concert, which he said was intended as a statement against fascism.

Despite the protests and antisemitic incidents on campus, the conference went on.

In an opening speech, Susan Abulhawa, a novelist and conference organizer, criticized “the hysterical racist conversations and panic” over the festival.

“We remain proud, unbroken, defiant, honoring our ancestors, even though we are battered, colonized, exiled, raw, terrorized and demeaned wholesale,” she said.

Alumni Donors Push Back

One day after the Indigenous Peoples’ Day post, Ms. Magill issued her first statement condemning the Hamas assault.

Critics said it was insufficiently forceful.

That same day Mr. Rowan submitted an opinion piece to The Daily Pennsylvanian, criticizing Ms. Magill for what he called her “moral failure” to condemn the conference. He urged alumni to send in $1 checks and repeated the call on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”

Mr. Rowan serves as chairman of the board of Wharton, the university’s business school, where many of Penn’s big-money donors earned degrees. The school, which wields tremendous influence over the university’s operations, is responsible for much of Penn’s fund-raising and prestige.

Some Wharton alumni had been unhappy with the university’s direction for a long time.

Jonathon S. Jacobson, who founded the investment firm HighSage Ventures, wrote in a recent letter to Ms. Magill that he and his wife had given gifts over the years that amounted to “multiple seven figures,” including significant money for Penn’s basketball program.

But, he wrote, he began cutting donations nearly two years ago. “The university that I attended and shaped me is virtually unrecognizable today,” he wrote, “and the values it stands for are not American ones.”

He added, “You are a product of a very screwed-up higher ed values system, where academic rigor has been replaced by extremist political ideology.”

He also suggested that the university had pressured women on the swim team and their parents to not speak out publicly about Lia Thomas, a transgender athlete.

In a text message, Mr. Jacobson said that he would not go into detail about why he stopped giving, but added, “I stopped supporting Penn for many reasons.”

Other Wharton alumni questioned the direction of the business school.

Since she started as dean in 2020, Erika James, the first Black woman to hold that job, has emphasized diversity, equity and inclusion programs — including the addition of a graduate major on the subject — as well as environmental, social and corporate governance.

That agenda may have driven away some alumni. In his opinion piece, Mr. Rowan wrote that the university had “already lost” a $100 million gift, a reference to a donation by Ross Stevens, founder of Stone Ridge Asset Management, to the University of Chicago’s Booth business school.

Dr. Stevens, an alumnus of both Booth and Wharton, signed the open letter.

He would not publicly discuss his $100 million donation to Booth. But two friends confirmed that he had planned to give the money to Wharton, but changed his mind because he thought the school was prioritizing D.E.I. over enhancing the business school’s academic excellence."

No matter what you think of the conflict, expressions of solidarity aren’t just appreciated; they are expected.

But as we argue in the video above, the insistence on picking a side threatens the public’s ability to take a holistic view of what is happening, to recognize and acknowledge atrocities irrespective of their perpetrators and to honor and mourn those who lost their lives.

If truth is the first casualty in war, empathy is the second."

Tasneem Ismael Ahel’s audio messages typically arrive all at once.

Sometimes there are 16 files. Sometimes there are 24. Sometimes there are just five.

The messages are often stuck, trapped for days in electronic transit because of a communications blackout imposed by Israel when it cut off electricity in Gaza, silencing voices from the besieged enclave.

That is, until a fleeting Wi-Fi signal appears.

For many Palestinians in Gaza, sporadic access to WhatsApp is one of the few outlets for sharing firsthand accounts of the war happening around them: raw reflections on death, despair and shattered dreams sent via audio messages from a territory under siege.

Mr. Tibon and his neighbors in Kibbutz Nahal Oz, a village that stands a few hundred yards from the Gaza Strip, have become accustomed to frequent rocket fire from militants in Gaza. Bomb shelters are installed in every home, and residents are used to rushing into them every few weeks.

But soon after Mr. Tibon, 35, took shelter on Saturday with his wife and two young daughters, he knew something was very different about this attack.

The sound of gunfire.

Then came a morbid realization.

“There were terrorists inside the kibbutz, inside our neighborhood and — at some point — outside our window,” Mr. Tibon recalled in a phone interview on Sunday morning. “We could hear them talk. We could hear them run. We could hear them shooting their guns at our house, at our windows.”"

The footage has become a widely cited piece of evidence as Israeli and American officials have made the case that an errant Palestinian rocket malfunctioned in the sky, fell to the ground and caused a deadly explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City.

But a detailed visual analysis by The New York Times concludes that the video clip — taken from an Al Jazeera television camera livestreaming on the night of Oct. 17 — shows something else. The missile seen in the video is most likely not what caused the explosion at the hospital. It actually detonated in the sky roughly two miles away, The Times found, and is an unrelated aspect of the fighting that unfolded over the Israeli-Gaza border that night.

The Times’s finding does not answer what actually did cause the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital blast, or who is responsible. The contention by Israeli and American intelligence agencies that a failed Palestinian rocket launch is to blame remains plausible. But the Times analysis does cast doubt on one of the most publicized pieces of evidence that Israeli officials have used to make their case and complicates the straightforward narrative they have put forth."
399,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-market-air-strike-jabaliya.html,"Israeli airstrikes pounded Gaza on Monday, flattening mosques over the heads of worshipers, wiping away a busy marketplace full of shoppers and killing entire families, witnesses and authorities in Gaza said.

Five Israeli airstrikes ripped through the marketplace in the Jabaliya refugee camp, reducing it to rubble and killing dozens, the authorities said. Other strikes hit four mosques in the Shati refugee camp and killed people worshiping inside, they said. Witnesses said boys had been playing soccer outside one of the mosques when it was struck.

The strikes came as part of Israel’s response to Saturday’s attack, when hundreds of Palestinian gunmen swept across Israel’s border with the Gaza Strip, killing civilians and soldiers in shooting rampages and firing thousands of rockets toward the center of the country. The fighters are believed to be holding 150 hostages, both civilians and soldiers. About 900 Israelis were killed and more than 2,600 were injured, according to Israeli officials.

Israel says its strikes are targeting centers of operations of Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that controls Gaza. It confirmed hitting the mosques, saying it was targeting Hamas infrastructure or fighters inside those buildings."
400,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/opinion/israel-palestine-college-campuses.html,"For the past two and a half weeks, college leaders have canceled or anxiously discussed canceling campus speeches and events that touch on Israel and Palestine. They’ve agonized over the wording of official school statements about the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel and, in some cases, issued second statements to amend, augment or atone for the first ones.

Students, meanwhile, have blasted those administrators for saying too much or too little. They’ve complained about feeling stranded. They’ve demanded more protection.

The tense situation largely reflects the intense differences of opinion with which many onlookers, including students, interpret and react to the rival claims and enduring bloodshed in the Middle East. But it tells another story, too: one about the evolution of higher education over the past quarter-century, the promises that schools increasingly make to their students and the expectations that arise from that.

Many students now turn to the colleges they attend for much more than intellectual stimulation. They look for emotional affirmation. They seek an acknowledgment of their wounds along with the engagement of their minds. And that’s in significant measure because many schools have encouraged that mind-set, casting themselves as stewards of students’ welfare, guarantors of their safety, places of refuge, precincts of healing."
401,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/us/politics/israel-hamas-washington-biden.html,"The sensitivity of that was made clear by mixed signals sent by Mr. Biden’s own administration. The State Department’s Office of Palestinian Affairs posted a message on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, on Saturday pressing “all sides to refrain from violence and retaliatory attacks,” and the account of Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken posted a message on Sunday encouraging Turkey’s “advocacy for a cease-fire.” Both posts were subsequently deleted following an outcry from Israel supporters who said it was too soon to urge Israel to stand down.

Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Blinken have otherwise steadfastly declared that Israel has a right to defend itself. The administration has begun shipping military equipment to Israel to replenish its supplies and moving American warships and planes to the region to deter Iran or other enemies of Israel from escalating the fight.

In a written statement on Monday, Mr. Biden implicitly compared the Hamas strike to the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. “We remember the pain of being attacked by terrorists at home, and Americans across the country stand united against these evil acts that have once more claimed innocent American lives,” he said. “It is an outrage. And we will continue to show the world that the American people are unwavering in our resolve to oppose terrorism in all forms.”

With more than 900 Israelis reported killed and about 150 taken hostage, including women and children, administration officials agreed that Mr. Netanyahu had no choice but to respond with overwhelming force. Any country in the world would retaliate if its territory were invaded by land, sea and air and its citizens massacred at a concert or dragged out of their homes to be shot or hauled off as captives.

For Mr. Biden and the United States, the fact that at least 11 Americans were killed and an unknown number possibly taken hostage makes it an American crisis as well. On Monday, Hamas threatened to execute a civilian hostage every time an airstrike hits Gaza “in their homes without warning,” raising the stakes for Washington."
402,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/us/politics/intel-rocket-gaza-hospital-blast.html,"American intelligence officials said Tuesday they now had “high confidence” that the blast at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza last week was the result of a Palestinian rocket that broke up mid-flight, and that no Israeli weapon was involved in the explosion.

The officials said, however, that numerous mysteries still remained about the incident. Those include how many people were killed or injured when, by the U.S. account, the warhead of a Palestinian rocket landed in the parking lot of the hospital. But they said there was little damage to the hospital itself, and no collapse of the structure.

U.S. intelligence agencies released no new imagery or other new evidence to make their case. Instead, they said their strengthened assessment came from Israeli intercepts of Palestinian armed groups and publicly available video. Those videos, the U.S. officials said, allowed them to assess that the rocket was launched from Gaza and, after a “catastrophic motor failure,” the warhead fell on the hospital’s parking lot. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information, said there was no evidence an Israeli launch could have been responsible.

A U.S. intelligence official said the analysis of the videos has focused primarily on one recorded by Al Jazeera, though there are multiple videos of projectiles in the skies and the explosion at the hospital. The U.S. intelligence analysis of the Al Jazeera video is at odds with a New York Times investigation, which found that the projectile shown in that video and others was launched from Israel and exploded well away from the hospital. A spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said The Times and intelligence agencies had different interpretations of the video.

U.S. officials said their assessment was also based on communications intercepts provided by the Israelis and images of the explosion and aftermath. Last week, U.S. officials said their early intelligence showed that the blast was caused by an armed Palestinian group, rebutting Palestinian claims that an Israeli strike caused the explosion. U.S. spy agencies did not release detailed evidence at the time to support their assessment.

On Tuesday, U.S. intelligence officials reaffirmed their assessment that Israel was not responsible for the explosion. The evaluation reflected a higher degree of certainty by U.S. intelligence officials that Israel was not responsible for the blast.

Israel has said the explosion, which resulted in a significant number of casualties, was caused by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a group allied with Hamas. The group said Israel’s accusations that one of its rockets malfunctioned and hit the hospital were “false and baseless.” Hamas has not provided any documentation of Israeli involvement.

The hospital blast prompted protests around the region. In an early claim, Hamas said that the hospital had been hit by an Israeli missile. President Biden, flying to Israel for a visit, said last week that preliminary evidence was that the strike had been “done by the other team,’’ but that the conclusion was preliminary.

But the initial account by Hamas took hold, especially at a time when Israel was carrying out airstrikes in advance of a potential ground attack intended to eliminate Hamas after the terror attack that the Israeli government says killed more than 1,400 people. Israel’s relentless artillery and bombing campaign in response has killed 5,700 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry.

The latest American assessment is in part based on what has not been discovered. A senior intelligence official said there were no images of any Palestinians displaying an Israeli weapon from the bomb site.

U.S. officials said only light damage was sustained at the site, which is consistent with the premise of a Gaza-made rocket that broke up in flight, rather than an Israeli munition striking the hospital.

Images of a fireball at the hospital site, and pictures taken after the fact showing burned cars in the compound’s parking lot, are consistent with a malfunctioning missile, according to U.S. officials.

The American assessment also relies heavily on intercepts provided by Israeli intelligence agencies. U.S. officials said the Israelis have provided multiple recordings that American intelligence agencies say they have authenticated. All of the recordings are secondhand accounts: members of Hamas discussing their belief that the explosion was caused by an errant or malfunctioning rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. U.S. officials did not provide recordings or transcriptions of these intercepts.

The declassified assessment provides no specific information on where U.S. intelligence officials think a rocket causing the blast was launched from inside Gaza.

But the senior official said the agencies were continuing to investigate. If the United States gets additional information that would point in a different direction, the official said, intelligence agencies will release it.

On Monday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain said his country’s intelligence services assessed that a Palestinian rocket fired from Gaza and aimed at Israel was likely the cause of the deaths at the hospital.

“On the basis of the deep knowledge and analysis of our intelligence and weapons experts, the British government judges that the explosion was likely caused by a missile or part of one that was launched from within Gaza towards Israel,” Mr. Sunak said.

Last week, U.S. intelligence agencies said that they were working to corroborate an Israeli assessment that the explosion resulted from an errant rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

The number of casualties from the explosion at the hospital remains in dispute.

U.S. officials estimated last week that between 100 and 300 people were killed, but said the death toll was likely at the low end of that range. On Tuesday, U.S. officials said they only had low confidence in that assessment. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said the death toll was 471, a figure revised down from their earlier assessment of 500.

U.S. officials said on Tuesday that an accurate count of the people who died at the hospital was impossible to obtain because of a lack of independent sources.

Days after Hamas accused Israel of bombing a hospital in Gaza City and killing hundreds of people, the armed Palestinian group has yet to produce or describe any evidence linking Israel to the blast, says it cannot find the munition that hit the site and has declined to provide detail to support its count of the casualties.

The Hamas-run health ministry has also declined to release further details about those 471 victims, and all traces of the munition have seemingly vanished from the site of the blast, adding to the difficulty in assessing its provenance. Raising further questions about Hamas’s claims, the impact site turned out to be the hospital parking lot, and not the hospital itself."
403,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/arts/design/el-museo-del-barrio-artwork-palestinian-flag.html,"El Museo del Barrio, a Manhattan museum dedicated to Puerto Rican and Latin American art, decided not to display an artwork it had commissioned for its annual Día de los Muertos celebrations this month after the artists included a Palestinian flag in it.

The museum then canceled a fund-raiser planned for Tuesday night where the new artwork, “Recorder y Unificar” (“Remember and Unite”), was to have been prominently displayed, saying that “at this moment when so many are suffering” it was encouraging donors to contribute to relief efforts.

The artists who created “Recorder y Unificar,” Roy Baizan and Odalys Burgoa, said that museum officials raised objections to the inclusion of the Palestinian flag last week but that they had refused to remove it, seeing it as integral to a work that is in part about political resistance and commemorating the dead. The piece paid homage to traditional altars for Day of the Dead celebrations, with milk crates and tall candles alongside sections dedicated to groups like the Young Lords and thinkers like Frantz Fanon.

“We were commemorating lots of activists,” said Baizan, 27. “It was about saying that all our struggles are interconnected.”

At one point the artists suggested that the museum could include a disclaimer, noting that the work represented the views of the artists but not the museum. After several days of negotiations, Baizan said, the museum decided not to display the work, which was installed in its cafe, and blacked out the windows to the cafe. The decision not to display the artwork was reported earlier by Hyperallergic.

Burgoa, 29, said that “the Palestinian flag is the reason the altar is censored and to me that’s wrong.”

Patrick Charpenel, the executive director of museum, which is on Fifth Avenue near 104th Street, did not respond to requests for comment.

The museum said in a statement that Baizan had “made a last-minute modification to the altar without further consultation or approval from El Museo as required by our contract with them.”

“They converted the altar from a religious and cultural symbol into a political statement,” the museum said.

The museum said that its decision to cancel the fund-raiser Tuesday night was separate from its issues with the artists and the work they created. It said that public Día de los Muertos events for the community would move forward.

The decision not to display the newly commissioned work was another example of how differences over the Israel-Hamas war are straining artists and cultural institutions. After 92NY pulled an event last week with the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen because of statements Nguyen had made criticizing Israel, other authors canceled speaking engagements there, some members of its staff resigned and its marquee literary program was put on hold.

Burgoa and Baizan disputed the idea that they had injected politics into the altar at the last minute. They said that a September version of their proposal had highlighted plans to include revolutionary figures including Hiram Maristany, a photographer and member of the Young Lords who led El Museo in the 1970s.

Burgoa pointed to text that the museum had approved on a painting behind the altar that said, “The police, immigration police, is the same garbage.” She said that the phrase came from a banner she saw during the 2020 George Floyd protests.

“They knew it was political,” she said.

The museum said the artwork is still in its cafe, which is currently closed, and that it plans to pay the artists for the commission."
404,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/world/middleeast/un-security-council-guterres-israel.html,"Calls for a cease-fire dominated Tuesday’s daylong United Nations Security Council meeting on the Israel-Hamas war, with senior U.N. officials, foreign ministers of Arab countries and many other diplomats, including China and Russia, noting that the number of Palestinian civilians killed was mounting and that the humanitarian situation in Gaza was deteriorating rapidly.

Many speakers also denounced Hamas. The U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, condemned Hamas’s terrorist attacks on Oct. 7 that started the war and demanded that all hostages taken that day be released.

But he also said that the attack on Israel had not happened “in a vacuum” and noted that Palestinians had suffered more than five decades of occupation and oppression by Israel, comments that drew sharp criticism from Israeli officials.

Mr. Guterres told the Council: “The grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas. And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.”"
405,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/us/politics/israel-hamas-cease-fire.html,"The United States on Tuesday rejected growing calls to support a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas because such a move would only benefit Hamas, a White House spokesman said.

The spokesman, John F. Kirby, said the administration supported pauses in the conflict to allow the flow of humanitarian aid. But he said civilian casualties were all but inevitable as Israel tries to vanquish Hamas in Gaza.

“We’re going to continue to make sure Israel has the tools and the capabilities that they need to defend themselves,” Mr. Kirby said. “We’re going to continue to try to get that humanitarian assistance in, and we’re going to continue to try to get hostages and people out of Gaza appropriately.”

Mr. Kirby added, “A cease-fire, right now, really only benefits Hamas.”

“It is ugly and it’s going to be messy, and innocent civilians are going to be hurt going forward,” he said. The United States, he added, had not discussed any red lines with Israel.

U.S. and Israeli officials have consistently rejected calls for a cease-fire, insisting that Israel must be given time to eradicate Hamas. But the calls for an end to the fighting are growing louder.

On Tuesday, the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, called for a humanitarian cease-fire in an address to the U.N. Security Council. Mr. Guterres said it was important to recognize that the attacks by Hamas “did not happen in a vacuum” and that Palestinians had been subjected to 56 years of “suffocating occupation.”

“The grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas,” he said. “And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.”

In recent weeks, President Biden has faced pressure from members of his own party in Congress, as well as progressive Jewish groups, who staged a protest against the war on Capitol Hill.

The war erupted after Hamas launched attacks inside Israel’s borders on Oct. 7, killing 1,400 people. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said more than 5,700 people, nearly half of them children, had been killed since Israel began its response to the attack. The figure cannot be independently verified.

Israel has agreed under pressure to cease-fires in past conflicts with Gaza, including in 2012 after Israel had similarly threatened an invasion and deployed ground forces on the territory’s border. Unlike then, however, Israeli leaders have in this case set Hamas’s total destruction as a goal, making it difficult to back down with limited results.

On Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told the Security Council that humanitarian pauses “must be considered” to allow food, water and other necessities to reach Gaza and for civilians to get out of harm’s way.

“There is no hierarchy when it comes to protecting a civilian’s life,” he said. “Civilians are civilians.”

Though Mr. Blinken did not specify their length, those pauses would presumably involve a very brief halt in combat well short of a typical cease-fire, which can last for days, weeks or indefinitely.

“Israel has to do everything it can to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” Mr. Blinken said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “Freezing things in place where they are now would allow Hamas to remain where it is and to repeat what it’s done sometime in the future. No country could accept that.”

The U.N. agency that aids Palestinians, UNRWA, has warned that the region is running low on fuel, which would particularly affect hospitals that are operating generators. Mr. Kirby said that the United States would continue to work to get fuel into Gaza, but added that Israel had a legitimate concern that Hamas could abscond with it and use it for military purposes.

Mr. Biden conceded on Tuesday that it was not reaching civilians fast enough."

It was not possible to independently verify the claims, but it was clear that even before Israeli soldiers have set foot in the Palestinian enclave to retaliate for Hamas’s Oct. 7 rampage in Israel, a humanitarian disaster in Gaza was growing worse by the day.

If a diplomatic solution is possible, there was little sign of it Tuesday at the United Nations, where diplomats spent the day issuing futile pleas for a ceasefire and bitter denunciations.

Israel’s foreign minister, Eli Cohen, began his address to the Security Council by holding up photos of Israeli children kidnapped when Hamas gunmen and allied militants streamed into towns and military bases, shooting mostly unarmed civilians and seizing hostages. “I have to remember and never let you forget,” he said."

As ambassadors from around the world gathered at the U.N. to discuss the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, family members of the hostages and Israeli officials were joined at the plaza by supporters rallying for greater action on securing the return of those who were abducted by Hamas on Oct. 7, the day the terrorist group invaded Israel, killing more than 1,400 people.

“We’re not satisfied knowing that it’s been 17 days and nothing seems to be moving,” said Orna Neutra, whose son, Omer Neutra, is being held in Gaza. “This is a world crisis, it’s not just our personal crisis. There were at least 33 citizens of different countries in the world. Where are they? Everyone needs to speak up.”

Ronen Neutra, Omer’s father, said his family had no idea where Omer was or what condition he might be in. Omer was serving as a soldier in the Israeli military on the border with Gaza when he was abducted, but he grew up in New York.

“We are calling all the international world countries to unite and work together in helping those innocent people, the innocent families, and bring them back,” Mr. Neutra said.

Alana Zeitchik, whose six family members were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz, the site of one of Hamas’s brutal Oct. 7 attacks, said her goal was to share her family’s story and keep the spotlight on the missing.

Ms. Zeitchik’s cousin Sharon Cunio; Sharon’s husband, David Cunio; and their 3-year-old twin daughters, Emma and Julia, were believed to have been abducted, as was Ms. Zeitchik’s cousin Danielle Alony and her 5-year-old daughter, Amelia.

“The world is very divided, but I’m not an expert on that,” Ms. Zeitchik said. “I’m an expert on loving my family. Everyone should understand what that feels like, to love your family so much. And I want our families home.”"
409,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/opinion/palestinian-hamas-misinformation.html,"Many years ago, when I first started covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I got to know a gifted Palestinian journalist who, for reasons that will become apparent in a moment, I’ll refer to only by his first name, Said.

As with many other Palestinian journalists, Said’s primary source of income was working with foreign reporters as a “fixer,” someone who could arrange difficult meetings, translate from Arabic, show you around. Said had an independent streak and he was no fan of Yasir Arafat, which made him particularly helpful in cutting through the Palestinian Authority’s propagandistic bombast.

With Said, I interviewed senior Hamas leaders in Gaza, officials in Ramallah, retired terrorists in Nablus, political dissidents in Jenin and construction workers in Hebron. We developed a friendship. Then, shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, he called me in a panic because something I had written in The Wall Street Journal had met with the displeasure of officials in the Palestinian Authority. The goon squad, he said, had paid his family an admonitory visit in their apartment, and he wanted me to take the story down. That was out of the question, I told him. It was never safe for us to work together again.

I mention this anecdote in the wake of last week’s sensational story that an Israeli airstrike had killed some 500 people at a Gaza hospital — a story variously attributed to “Palestinian officials,” “the Gazan health ministry” and “health authorities in the besieged enclave.” The story sparked violent protests throughout the Middle East.

It has since become clear that nearly every element of that story is, to put it gently, highly dubious.

A missile did not hit the hospital but rather the parking lot next to it. Abundant evidence, confirmed by U.S. intelligence and independent analyses, indicates that the explosion was caused by a missile fired from Gaza, which was intended to kill Israelis but malfunctioned and fell to earth. There is no solid reason to believe the death toll reached anywhere near 500. And the “Gazan health ministry” is not some sort of apolitical body but a Hamas-owned entity, towing and promoting whatever the terrorist organization demands.

I’ll leave the media criticism to others. But Western audiences will never grasp the nature of the current conflict until they internalize one central fact. In Israel, as in every other democracy, political and military officials sometimes lie — but journalists hold them to account, tell the stories they want to tell, and don’t live in fear of midnight knocks on the door.

The Palestinian territories, by contrast, are republics of fear — fear of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and of Hamas in Gaza. Palestinians are neither more nor less honest than people elsewhere. But, as in any tyrannical or fanatical regime, those who stray from the approved line put themselves at serious risk.

This is a truth that only rarely slips out — but when it does, it’s revealing.

During the first major Israel-Hamas war, in 2008 and 2009, Palestinian groups claimed the death toll was mostly civilian, with roughly 1,400 people killed. But a Palestinian doctor working in Gaza’s Shifa hospital told a different story. “The number of deceased stands at no more than 500 to 600,” he said. “Most of them are youths between the ages of 17 to 23 who were recruited to the ranks of Hamas, who sent them to the slaughter,” he said. Tellingly, according to the Israeli news site YNet, “the doctor wished to remain unidentified, out of fear for his life.”

Or take the case of Hani al-Agha, a Palestinian journalist who was jailed for weeks and tortured by Hamas in 2019. In that case, the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate took the extraordinary step of condemning al-Agha’s arrest and torture as “an attempt to intimidate journalists in Gaza Strip, who are subject to repressive police authority.” Yet, outside of a few news releases, the story received almost no coverage in the wider media.

Human rights organizations occasionally take a break from their incessant criticism of Israel to pay attention to this kind of atrocious repression. But only rarely do Western audiences understand the full extent to which information emerging from Gaza is suspect — at least until it has been extensively and independently corroborated by journalists who aren’t living in fear of Hamas, and don’t need to protect someone who is. Readers who wouldn’t normally be inclined to believe man-in-the-street interviews in, say, Pyongyang, or regime pronouncements coming out of the Kremlin, should be equally skeptical about the phrase “Palestinian officials say.”

The news media still needs fixers and freelancers to tell the full story in war zones. But people consuming that media should know the threats, pressures and cultures that these journalists operate in — not because we necessarily distrust them individually, but because we appreciate the dangerous circumstances in which they find themselves.

The next time there’s a story about an alleged Israeli atrocity in Gaza, readers deserve to know how the information was acquired and from whom. It’s bad enough that Hamas tyrannizes Palestinians and terrorizes Israelis. We don’t need it misinforming the rest of us."
410,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/nyregion/palestinian-rally-times-square-israel.html,"By Monday, even the D.S.A. seemed uncomfortable.

In an interview, Jeremy Cohan, a co-chair of the New York City chapter of the D.S.A., said that the organization had promoted the rally at the request of a Palestinian solidarity group — he was not sure which — and that the D.S.A. had not organized or sponsored the event.

“I don’t think I regret for a minute standing against war and standing up for supporting an approach that points to the deeper roots of this conflict,” he said. But, he added, “we did not communicate that in a way that was adequately sensitive to the suffering of the people on all the sides of the conflict.”

Mr. Cohan also said he thought the barrage of criticism was “an opportunistic move by New York’s political establishment to try to drive a wedge in the growing progressive left ecosystem.”

The D.S.A. and other far-left groups have never been numerically dominant in New York City, where their membership hovers in the tens of thousands, and a little more than a dozen hold elected offices. But they have exerted an outsize influence on political debate in the city and nationally, helping push the center of the Democratic Party leftward.

Most are regarded as safe in their seats. But rising attacks against Israel may give more moderate Democrats an opening to marginalize D.S.A.-aligned officials and accelerate the party’s move back toward the political middle ahead of next year’s elections."
411,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/world/middleeast/israeli-hostage-gaza-yocheved-lifshitz.html,"Yocheved Lifshitz, the 85-year-old woman who was released after being held hostage by Palestinian militants in Gaza for 17 days, on Tuesday described being beaten while her captors took her away on a motorcycle.

Ms. Lifshitz said she was marched through a network of subterranean tunnels under Gaza that she likened to “a spider web.” She said that she was later treated relatively well, offering the first public account to emerge from the more than 200 hostages estimated to be held by Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza.

“I went through hell,” Ms. Lifshitz told reporters the day after her release, sitting in a wheelchair at a hospital in Tel Aviv amid a thicket of microphones.

She was freed along with Nurit Cooper, 79, on Monday and transferred from Hamas custody to Israeli forces via the International Committee for the Red Cross and Egypt. Both of their husbands are still being held hostage in Gaza.

Her account of the tunnels offered a glimpse of the difficulties facing Israel as it weighs whether and how to launch a ground invasion of Gaza to eliminate Hamas, which led the devastating Oct. 7 attacks against Israel.

Hamas has built a labyrinth of underground passages in Gaza for its fighters, military analysts said, complicating both Israel’s anticipated ground operation and any attempt to rescue the hostages.

Ms. Lifshitz’s voice at times faltered as she recalled her abduction and the horrors suffered by her neighbors when Hamas attacked her town of Kibbutz Nir Oz. Her daughter Sharone, who was crouched at her side on Tuesday, occasionally translated for foreign journalists.

“Many people stormed our homes, they beat people, some of them they abducted, like me,” Ms. Lifshitz said. “It made no difference, they abducted the elderly and the young.”

“In my memory, I have these images all the time,” she added later.

She said her kidnappers hauled her onto a motorcycle and beat her painfully in the ribs, making it hard for her to breathe, and also took away her watch. They drove off through the fields surrounding Nir Oz.

They took her through the network of tunnels until they reached a large hall where about 25 people were, she said. After about two to three hours, they separated five people from her kibbutz into their own room, where they were overseen by guards and a medic, she said.

Ms. Lifshitz said that she and others were relatively well taken care of, given medicine and the same food as their captors. Fearing disease, her captors worked to sanitize the area, she said, and doctors would visit sporadically to check on them. “They treated us gently and fulfilled all of our needs,” she said.

Hamas has released four hostages in the few days, including Judith and Natalie Raanan, American-Israeli citizens who were freed last week. Ms. Lifshitz is the first released hostage to speak publicly about her ordeal.

Ms. Lifshitz’s husband, Oded — an Israeli journalist and peace activist — remains in Hamas captivity, according to Israeli authorities.

The Hamas-led attacks against Israel’s border communities shocked and traumatized the country. Israel had repeatedly fought short battles with Palestinian militants in Gaza in recent years, but nothing approaching the scale and brutality of the assault.

Ms. Lifshitz at times criticized the Israeli military, saying that it and the Shin Bet domestic security service had ignored warning signs of the threat to towns near Gaza. The Israeli military’s chief of staff acknowledged after the attacks that the military had failed to live up to its mission to protect Israel’s citizens.

Weeks before the assault, Palestinians had rioted and fired explosive balloons near the Gaza border fence, sparking fires in southern Israel, Ms. Lifshitz said.

The Israeli army “didn’t take this seriously,” she said."

The Israeli military said yesterday that it had stepped up its bombardment of Gaza, where Palestinian officials said that hundreds of people had been killed. Diplomatic pressure grew for Israel to delay its ground invasion of the enclave.

Israel said it had struck more than 400 targets in the past 24 hours — on top of more than 320 a day earlier — in some of the most intense aerial attacks on Gaza in recent days. The Gaza Health Ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, said it had recorded the highest single-day death toll of the war: at least 704 people, killed in dozens of strikes on homes, a refugee camp and other places. It was not possible to verify the toll independently.

What’s next: Israeli military officials say they are well prepared for a ground assault in Gaza, but it remains unclear when and if such an invasion will occur. U.S. officials have said Israel’s military is not yet ready.

Analysis: Israel has set itself a stiff challenge in aiming to destroy Hamas. But an even bigger question looms: Who will govern Gaza if Hamas is gone? A ground war in Gaza could produce fierce street-to-street fighting. Here’s what the urban warfare might look like."
413,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/world/europe/interpreter-read-watch-recommend.html,"It has been an intense couple of weeks here at Interpreter HQ. “India’s Daughters,” the special newsletter series that I created with my colleagues Emily Schmall and Shalini Venugopal Bhagat, premiered last week. There will be a new chapter on Friday, and you can catch up with the first installment here if you missed it.

I’ve also been reporting on violations of international law in Israel and Gaza for the last two weeks, work that has built on the extraordinary efforts of my colleagues who are reporting from the region, sometimes at great personal peril. But even though I’m far from the fighting, thinking about war crimes and atrocities every day has taken its toll — and created a stark divide in my reading and watching habits.

On one side of that divide are the many treaties and legal sources I’ve been consulting, filling my browser’s tabs with various Geneva Conventions, expert commentaries, international criminal laws and military manuals on the laws of war, as well as reports from The Times and other sources on what’s actually happening to civilians on the ground.

The other, entirely different category is made up of the things I’ve been reading and watching to try to relax after long days at work — all of which are about as far from violence and war as anything could be.

Longtime readers will probably guess that “Pride and Prejudice,” by Jane Austen, is at the top of my decompress-and-disconnect list. As I’ve mentioned before, that’s always the first book that I pick up when I can’t sleep or otherwise need to calm my frenzied brain. But lately I’ve been pairing it with “The Scandalous Confessions of Lydia Bennet, Witch,” by Melinda Taub, an alternative retelling of the story with a couple of big twists. Full disclosure: The author is my sister, so I won’t offer my own review here. Instead, here is what Amal El-Mohtar had to say about it in The Times:

“It’s simply wonderful, a laugh-and-cry book. Taub’s close reading of and research into Austen’s work is remarkable; she threads a careful needle between invention and retelling, contemporary legibility and historical homage. The result is a terrifically well-balanced novel blending romance, fantasy and mystery: The story shifts its weight and colors depending on whom you think Lydia’s addressing with her narrative at any given moment.”

I also find sports narratives soothing. “Beckham,” Netflix’s rose-tinted documentary about David Beckham, is structured around a series of pivotal soccer matches in his career, which turned out to be ideal for me: The games generate enough suspense for the episodes to hold my attention — Will he score? Who will win?— but, because they mostly happened a decade or two ago, no actual stress about the results.

The sports angle probably also explains why I always find “Wimbledon,” a 2004 movie starring Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany, so relaxing. Although it is nominally a romantic comedy, the action is, as in “Beckham,” built around a series of tennis matches, with barely a gesture toward otherwise keeping the main characters apart. As someone who isn’t a particularly fervent fan of even real tennis matches, I find fictional ones pleasantly untaxing.

On days when I want to unwind but don’t feel like I could handle even a Nora Ephron amount of emotion, “Wimbledon” it is.

414,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/nyregion/columbia-giving-day-israel-hamas-war.html,"Columbia University has postponed a major fund-raising drive in the latest sign that on-campus turmoil caused by the Israel-Hamas war is not only testing the limits of free speech on campus, but is also poised to affect the institution’s pocketbook.

Columbia Giving Day, an annual event in which alumni and donors around the world are asked to donate to the university, was scheduled for this Wednesday. It was called off last week with no new date announced. Last year, the event raised almost $30 million in 24 hours.

Some prospective donors received emails saying that the university was instead focusing its efforts on ensuring student well-being and cultivating a safe campus space. A university spokeswoman, Samantha Slater, told The New York Times, “After careful consideration and consultation with University and alumni leadership, we decided that this is not the appropriate time to move forward with Columbia Giving Day.”

At Columbia, dueling pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrations, an assault on an Israeli student who had been hanging posters about Israeli hostages, and inflammatory statements by some staff members have roiled the campus since the Hamas attack on Oct. 7. More than 1,400 people were killed in Israel, and more than 200 are believed to be held hostage by Hamas and other armed groups. Israel has responded with an intense counteroffensive in Gaza that has killed more than 5,000 people there, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

Other Ivy League universities, including Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania, have seen high-profile donors cut ties over their dissatisfaction with how college leaders are handling student and faculty reaction to the Hamas attack, particularly taking aim at school leaders who do not speak out against pro-Palestinian student groups who have blamed only Israel for the outbreak of violence.

While Columbia administrators have condemned the “disturbing anti-Semitic and Islamophobic acts, including intimidation and outright violence” on the campus in recent weeks, they have not taken specific action against any student groups or professors for expressing their views on either side of the conflict. A statement on Wednesday by the new Columbia President, Minouche Shafik, specifically mentioned that doxxing — or the public posting of individuals’ personal information — would not be tolerated, but affirmed her desire not to censor speech on either side.

“Columbia’s role is to create space for our scholars and students to fill with their own moral and intellectual conversations, an essential function in a world in which that space is narrowing,” she wrote.

The anger among Jewish alumni and donors against elite American colleges for allowing on-campus groups to suggest the Hamas attack was an act of legitimate resistance was captured in an impassioned speech last week by Shai Davidai, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School. In what he called an “Open Letter to Every Parent in America,” he called Dr. Shafik a “coward” for refusing to stand up to what he called the “pro-terror” voices on campus."
415,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/business/economy/biden-oil-prices-middle-east.html,"Biden administration officials, worried that a growing conflict in the Middle East could send global oil prices soaring, are looking for ways to hold down American gasoline prices if such a jump occurs.

Those efforts include discussions with large oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia that are holding back supply and with American oil producers that have the ability to pump more than they already are producing, administration officials say.

A senior administration official said in an interview that it was also possible that President Biden could authorize a new round of releases from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve, an emergency stockpile of crude oil that is stored in underground salt caverns near the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Biden tapped the reserve aggressively last year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices skyrocketing, leaving the amount of oil in those reserves at historically low levels.

The conflict in the Middle East has not yet sent oil prices surging. A barrel of Brent crude oil was trading for about $88 on global markets on Wednesday. That was up from about $84 earlier this month, shortly before Hamas attacked Israel and rattled markets. But analysts and administration officials fear prices could rise significantly more if the conflict in Israel spreads, restricting the flow of oil out of Iran or other major producers in the region.

So far, American drivers have not felt a pinch. The average price of gasoline nationally was $3.54 a gallon on Wednesday, according to AAA. That was down about 30 cents from a month ago and 25 cents from the same day last year.

Administration officials are wary of the possibility that prices could again jump above $5 a gallon, a level they briefly touched in the spring of 2022. Mr. Biden took extraordinary efforts then to help bring prices down — but those steps are likely to be far less effective in the event of a new oil shock.

“They succeeded last year in the second half, but this year I think they’ve kind of run out of bullets,” said Amrita Sen, director of research at Energy Aspects.

In part that’s because the administration did not refill the strategic reserve more aggressively when prices were lower, Ms. Sen said. That could undercut its ability to counteract rising prices now.

“They got a little overconfident that prices would stay low,” she said. “In some ways, they’ve missed the boat.”"
416,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/world/europe/israel-hamas-russia-putin.html,"President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has long cast himself as a friend of Israel and the Jewish people.

He helped establish visa-free travel between Russia and Israel in 2008, presided over the construction of a sprawling Moscow Jewish Museum in 2012 and, side by side with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem in 2020, unveiled a memorial to the victims of Nazi Germany’s siege of Leningrad.

But amid the worst attack on Israel in 50 years, the high regard that Mr. Putin has shown for Israel in the past appears remarkably absent. More than three days after the start of the incursion by Hamas, there has been no message of condolence from the Kremlin, even though Mr. Putin previously published such notes of sympathy in the wake of terrorist attacks in Israel.

And he has not yet called Mr. Netanyahu, even though he spoke with Israeli leaders at least 11 times in 2022 and developed a close relationship with Mr. Netanyahu over more than a decade of meetings and phone calls."
417,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/business/media/writers-guild-of-america-hamas-attack.html,"Facing mounting pressure from more than 300 Hollywood screenwriters questioning why it had not publicly condemned the Hamas attack on Israel this month, the Writers Guild of America West sent a letter to its members on Tuesday that sought to explain its silence while also calling the attack “an abomination.”

The letter, signed by the guild’s leadership and viewed by The New York Times, said the reason the union had not issued a statement after the attack on Oct. 7 was not “because we are paralyzed by factionalism or masking hateful views” but rather because “we are American labor leaders, aware of our limitations and humbled by the magnitude of this conflict.”

The guild’s letter acknowledged that it had publicly commented on other situations “which could be characterized as beyond our scope,” but that it had not made any statement following, for instance, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“It can be an imprecise science for a labor union to pick and choose where it weighs in on both domestic and world affairs,” said the letter, which was signed by the president, Meredith Stiehm; the vice president, Michele Mulroney; and Betsy Thomas, the secretary-treasurer.

Still, they added, “We understand this has caused tremendous pain and for that we are truly sorry.”

(The west and east branches of the W.G.A. are affiliated unions with separate leadership that together represent more than 11,000 writers.)

On Oct. 15, a group of screenwriters sent an open letter to the guild asking why it had not publicly denounced the attack on Israel, noting the union had made public statements in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and the #MeToo reckoning. They also noted that other major Hollywood unions had issued statements condemning the attack.

The letter has now been signed by more than 300 writers, including Jerry Seinfeld, Eric Roth (“Killers of the Flower Moon”) and Amy Sherman-Palladino (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”). Some Jewish screenwriters had begun to question whether they should remain part of an organization that they felt did not support them.

Ms. Stiehm’s initial reply to the open letter was an email to inquiring members saying that the lack of response was because “the board’s viewpoints are varied, and we found consensus out of reach.”

The letter on Tuesday, which said the guild’s leadership was “horrified by the atrocities committed by Hamas,” was an attempt to stem the outrage.

“I really appreciate this statement,” said the screenwriter Howard Gordon (“24” and “Homeland”), who added in an interview that the silence from the guild had prompted responses from both Jewish and non-Jewish members ranging from rage to fear to the desire to resign from the organization.

“I hope this letter goes a long way to sort of calming some of it down,” said Mr. Gordon, who signed the open letter to the guild. “Hopefully something constructive comes out of this, which is an acknowledgment of how we combat and confront and talk about antisemitism.”

For Dan Gordon, however, the apology came too late. Mr. Gordon, 76, sent a letter Tuesday morning resigning his membership in the organization, calling its silence “appalling.”

“It is corrosive to me as a writer and repugnant to every fiber of my being as a person of conscience,” wrote Mr. Gordon, who has no relation to Howard Gordon and is best known for “The Hurricane” and “Wyatt Earp.” “I am resigning my membership not because I wish to work on nonunion projects, nor cross any picket line, but because I no longer wish to be a fellow traveler with those who hide behind the fetid veil of a morally bankrupt wokeism and stand silent in the face of unadulterated evil.”

Mr. Gordon’s latest film, “Irena’s Vow” — about a young Polish-Catholic woman during World War II who hid 12 Jews in the basement of a German officer’s house without his knowledge for almost a year — debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival in September.

He will change his guild membership status to “financial core,” according to his letter. Under that designation, he will still receive the contract benefits earned by the guild but he will no longer be able to vote or attend any guild meetings. The designation is irreversible and viewed by the guild as an act of disloyalty. The W.G.A. maintains an online list of members who have chosen this status, with a reminder that “Fi-Core is forever.”

Mr. Gordon called Tuesday’s letter from the guild “pusillanimous” and faulted it for not calling for a release of the hostages.

“I don’t retract anything I said,” he added in an interview. “If one cannot condemn, clearly, and without reservation, what Hamas perpetrated, one’s moral compass is absent, not broken.”"

From New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.” [MUSIC PLAYING] I don’t really know how to start this. Grief moves slowly, and war moves quickly. One person said after last week’s audio essay, that, “To so quickly focus on the Israeli army’s response lacked a certain humanism.” And I understood and felt what they meant. I also want to stay in the grief I have for the Israelis killed and the fear I have for the hostages being held. And I think there would have been wisdom, emotional and geopolitical, if Israel had given itself time to grieve and time to plan before fully committing to a response. But that’s not what happened. Israel dropped more than 6,000 bombs on Gaza in just the first week. It tightened a noose around the territory, keeping out food and water and medicine and fuel. A report I saw a few days ago said that Gaza is down to one week of insulin. One week of insulin — less now. My wife is a type I diabetic, dependent on insulin to stay alive. A detail like that carries force for me. What if it was my wife, the person I love most who couldn’t get insulin? More than 5,000 Palestinians have been reported dead, many more injured. There’s a part of me that would like to stay in my feelings from right after Hamas’s attack, but that is not where this has held. And the decisions being made now, and that will be made soon, will decide a lot of lives. My approach to this topic is going to be to try to keep the boundaries of what can be said and considered open, to try to add context and to try to hear out a lot of different perspectives. I said this last week — I’m not somebody who believes that I know how to solve this conflict. I’m not somebody who believes this conflict can currently be solved. I think we’re at a much more primitive point in it right now. But the building toward somewhere better, I think, requires a lot of different experiences to be heard. So I have plans for shows right now with people who are much further right than me on this. I have plans that will center on Palestinian experiences and voices. But I wanted to begin with a show closer to where I am, which is not a popular or easy place to be at the moment, which is the Jewish left. Many of us on the Jewish left on this felt abandoned and morally appalled at the comments of people who had once been our allies immediately after. What the left came to mean, quickly, in this conflict, the people who defined it, were people who seemed to give no consideration to the lives of Israelis. We do. In many cases, the point of our involvement here is that we are attached in a deep way to Israel. Meanwhile, the force and ferocity of the Israeli response built. And if you believe, as many of us believe, that there is no answer to this for Israel, for anybody until Israel can live in security while Palestinians do not live inside a regime of oppression, and humiliation, and immiseration, and terror, then amidst the grief is a fear that this is only getting worse. Palestinians mourn their dead and hate their killers just as much and fiercely as Israelis do. And the two sides somehow must live next to each other. So what is the plan here? There are ideas that float around, and they’ve become, I think, scarier in recent years. In 2017, Bezalel Smotrich wrote that, quote, “Any solution must be based on cutting off the ambition to realize the Arab national hope between the Jordan and the Mediterranean. The statement the Arab yearning for national expression in the land of Israel cannot be repressed is incorrect.” He now serves in Netanyahu’s cabinet as minister of finance. This is the kind of thinking that has been in power in recent years — the thinking that says the repression has not been full enough. It has brought us here. But that does not mean it will weaken now. It may well strengthen. There are those who think a permanent occupation or an act of mass expulsion are the only true answers in this conflict. So I want to have a conversation with some other people coming from a similar perspective but with a lot more expertise on the core issues here than I have. Spencer Ackerman is a national security reporter, Pulitzer Prize winner, author of the newsletter “Forever Wars,” author of the great book on post-9/11 politics, “Reign of Terror.” Peter Beinart writes for New York Times Opinion. He’s a professor of journalism and political science at City University of New York. He’s the editor at large of Jewish Currents, and author of the Substack “The Beinart Notebook.” And they’ve both been writing pieces that I think are of deep relevance right now. Spencer has been particularly following up on the symmetries to post-9/11 politics in America and the way military planning happens in that kind of moment. Beinart wrote a great piece thinking about the question, before you can ever get to any kind of settlement, you need groups in power on both sides that would want to see a settlement. So if you want nonviolence to take hold, if you want other tactics to work, how are they rewarded? What are the feedback loops that can be created to give more power to those who want to see something very different? As always, my email ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING] Peter Beinart, Spencer Ackerman, welcome to the show.

spencer ackerman

Thanks for having me.

peter beinart

Thanks.

ezra klein

So Spencer, I want to begin here. What is your sense now of what Hamas was trying to achieve in this attack?

spencer ackerman

So there have been some interesting reports that have come out this week that I think clarify that question, but not in a satisfying way. There was a report out of The Washington Post, where a Hamas senior official, sort of on the face of it meaning to heighten a message of Israeli vulnerability, nevertheless said that they didn’t reckon that Israel would respond the way that Israel has. That they thought they would take some hostages and negotiate them for the thousands of Palestinians who are in Israeli military prisons, and the status quo ante would prevail. I think if it turns out that indeed Hamas was trying for a more limited sense of concrete achievement for liberating prisoners, that has turned out to be just catastrophically wrong.

ezra klein

I’ve seen some reporting, similarly, from Hamas on this, and I’ve found it truly bizarre. I mean, this was in planning, in scale, a kind of attack Hamas had never launched before. It’s a land, sea, and air attack. It involves mass killing of Israeli civilians, some things they probably didn’t know they would stumble into, like the rave which led to quite a bit of their body count. So maybe their soldiers, or whatever you want to call them, took a kind of gruesome initiative in that. But they also spread videos of them killing Israelis on social media. They’ve been on people’s Facebook pages almost gloating about their death. There were a lot of hostages taken. There are a lot of ways people characterize Hamas, but it would take a kind of genuine madness and true irrationality to me for them to plan an attack of that scale and not believe it would create an overwhelming Israeli response. Now, there’s been a lot of commentary saying, well, they must have known they would get this kind of response, and so they wanted it. They wanted to provoke Israel into this kind of attack. They wanted to disrupt the accords with Saudi Arabia, something like that. And those two narratives now seem in real tension. So I’m curious how you think about that piece of it?

spencer ackerman

So one thing that struck me from the first wave of Hamas statements during the weekend of the 7th, after Simchat Torah, was that they didn’t mention the Saudi deal. I was writing a piece for The Nation precisely about this when it happened and was looking very closely to see the degree to which, if at all, Hamas would mention it. And they didn’t. They were talking about more material facts closer to home rather than diplomatic facts on the horizon from 30,000 feet above — the freeing of the prisoners, the loosening of the Israeli strangulation of Gaza on down the line. And again, I think there are ways after the fact — I’ve seen this a lot in the American national security community over the last 12 days — that we often try and reason backward from the actions that a given combatant like Hamas took and presume a greater strategy there, presume that they must have known X, Y and Z would happen. That often is not the way combatants in war operate, from a planning stage to an execution stage, from a strategic to an operational to a tactical level. Should that be borne out by further reporting probably speaks to the way that miscalculation is an underappreciated factor in every wartime combatant. This is something I’ve seen up close and personally. The ambitions we have, the opportunities we see, the desires that we have when we give into violence on an institutional level blind us not just in the banal way to the humanity of the people that come into our crosshairs, but to our own recognition of what reality is and what’s achievable here. I hesitate to speculate or to put myself into a position of trying to read the minds of Hamas. All I can read are their statements and their actions, and through them, remember all of the times that I have seen optimistic, to the point of irrationality, statements from American, Israeli, all sorts of other combatants describing the glorious ways their war will go and why it will lead to the achievement of all of these grander objections that then go down in flames.

peter beinart

I would just add that although I don’t know what Hamas expected, I do think it’s important to remember that Hamas does have a multi-decade long history of intentionally targeting and killing civilians. They did it during the Second Intifada in the early 2000s. They did it during the 1990s, during the Oslo process. So I don’t think anyone should have been surprised that Hamas members would kill civilians. Maybe they hadn’t had the opportunity to kill this many, but this is something that Hamas has repeatedly shown that it’s willing to do.

ezra klein

And let me then build on that, because, as you say, this has been the most horrific of Hamas’s attacks. They have tried many things. Nothing has, from a perspective of pure murder, worked as well as this. What is your sense of how the attack has changed — let me put it this way — both the politics and the mass psychology in Israel?

peter beinart

I think that the agony that Israelis are going through is unfathomable, greater than what Americans experienced after Sept. 11. Greater just because as a share of the population it was much higher. Greater because of the deeper level of trauma that Israeli Jews and other Jews carry. And greater because Al Qaeda was far away from us. I mean, they came to New York and they were mostly in other parts of the world. Gaza and Hamas are on Israel’s borders. So that’s, I think, the profound reality. And I think there is, coexisting with that, a deep rage and anger at the Netanyahu government that eventually will probably produce some kind of political earthquake. But what kind of political earthquake, we don’t know. And I think an absolute resolute belief among Jewish Israelis — it’s important to remember that 20 percent of Israel’s citizens are Palestinians — but among Jewish Israelis, I think, overwhelming consensus that Hamas must be destroyed. Now, when you actually try to ask what that means, things become a lot more cloudy, and I don’t think people have good answers. But that gut-level emotional reaction seems nearly consensus.

ezra klein

I want to put a pin in that question of what it means to destroy Hamas. But I want to get at something else on the psychology. One of the things that has been very present for me in some of the more upsetting commentary right after Hamas’s attacks, partly the commentary that couldn’t imagine there being any such thing as an Israeli civilian, one thing I noticed in that is a kind of rigid categorization of power in a matchup between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza. Israel is by far the more powerful party. And you can see that right now. But you can’t understand Israeli psychology at all — you can’t understand, I think, Jewish psychology at all without understanding the fear of genuine eradication at the center of it. How many times Jews have been powerless. How many times Israel has faced, in living memory and the memory of people who are in power there now, attacks that if they had gone another way would have wiped Israel off the map. And so I wanted to get you to talk a bit about the way those two — both realities and psychologies — interplay, the Israeli strength and Israeli — the genuine felt sense it is a small place surrounded by people who would try to wipe it out if they could.

peter beinart

There’s no question that those things are buried very deep for many, many Jews and then, for Israelis, exacerbated by the traumas that have taken place in Israel. This happened almost 50 years to the day of the Yom Kippur War, which was an extremely traumatic experience. Many, many Israelis have people who have been lost. And I totally agree with you, one of the things that really disturbed me about some of the commentary on the left was that there was a language of things like decolonization that erased the humanity of Israeli Jews. And it reminded me of — this is something George Orwell wrote a lot about — the way in which certain kind of rhetorical formulations that people become very invested in then become a way of covering over the human realities of what’s actually being done in their name. And I felt that way about some of the language of decolonization. Well, this is just what decolonization looks like. If you have to break some eggs to make an omelet, so be it. That is to me a kind of monstrous kind of thinking, very frightening. I also think that this is fear that Israeli Jews have that has been fanned by a government that has dehumanized Palestinians and made it harder for Israeli Jews to see Palestinians as ordinary people who have ordinary human desires, who mostly just want to live and be able to raise their kids in the same kinds of ways that we all want to do. And I think because there has been so much dehumanization of Palestinians in Israel, it has made it even more difficult to see Palestinians in any other way than through as, essentially, the next group of people who threaten Jewish existence.

ezra klein

I want to ask you then about another side of this, which is how the attacks have changed psychology for Jews living outside Israel, and particularly those who have a very complicated or critical relationship with Israel, which I think describes everybody at the table here. There’s the period running up to this where the right-wing turn in Israeli politics I think began to sever a lot of ties people had. I mean, my relationship to Israel had changed quite a bit as the left began to collapse there, as the peace process died, as Netanyahu and very, very, very far-right extremist cabinet ministers took and held power. And then there was also the attacks and the moment after them, and then there was — I saw online and in a lot of people I knew a real rupture between those same Jews, many of whom who’ve worked for peace for a long time, and what they were seeing among people they often thought of as their allies. And I’ve been watching a community I’m part of try to manage these two now very complicated relationships. And I’m curious how you’ve experienced that, how you’ve seen it.

peter beinart

I genuinely believe that at the heart of Judaism is the metaphor of family. This is what makes it different than Christianity and Islam. Genesis is the story mostly of a family. And in Exodus, it becomes a nation. And it’s imagined as a kind of extended family — B’nai Israel, the children of Israel. Israel being the name that Isaac — that Jacob is given, sorry, after he wrestles with the angel. So I believe that very, very deeply. And so, for me, this has awoken that in some really, really, really powerful ways. And I struggle, and it’s. Very, very difficult to hold the sense of particular obligation, particular special connection that I feel to Israeli Jews, like Jews all over the world, with the fact that I know that so many people in my community are weaponizing that and using that in a way to lobotomize us so that we don’t care about what happens to Palestinians and so we are OK with whatever is done to them because we care only about our own families. And that logic can become horrifying in the days to come. So I have never felt as much of a sense of struggle with my own community and with my own love of a sense of community, and trying to hold that and also be desperately afraid of the way in which it’s leading some people to act.

ezra klein

Let’s talk then, Spencer, about what is actually being done. How would you describe what Israel is doing in response, both what the tactics are — what they have announced and shown themselves to be doing since Hamas’s attack —and then what the broader strategy is? What have they articulated, or what do they appear to be trying to achieve?

spencer ackerman

Tactically what Israel is producing is collective punishment against 2.3 million Gazans intensifying its strangulation of some of the most densely packed places on Earth, calling it as it will. I started seeing reports that Gaza is without painkillers, that doctors are operating on wounded people — of whom there are I believe more than 10,000 as of this recording — without anesthesia. This is Israel’s tactics against Gaza. Not against Hamas — against Gaza.

ezra klein

people.

spencer ackerman

Yes. And let’s just skip to the day after what Netanyahu describes as a long war. Israel can deal severe blows to human beings and has an unquestioned capability to perhaps kill members of Hamas and perhaps decapitate Hamas’s leadership structure as well. But there will be something that comes after whatever Israel’s operation is. And as long as Israel keeps the conditions of strangulation on Gaza, there will be something that comes after Hamas, whatever its form ends up taking. And when we see Israel flattening buildings, taking these kinds of collective punishment measures, then it looks to me less like a war against Hamas and more like a calling of Palestinians in Gaza with Hamas as a proximate target.

ezra klein

One thing I have heard many people say now, and that includes many Palestinians, but it also now includes some Israelis who have called for this openly, like a member of the Knesset, is that what Israel really wants to do here is what gets called a second Nakba, a second mass expulsion of Palestinians, creation of hundreds of thousands of refugees who don’t or cannot come back. And one reason people believe that is that there are those in the Israeli government who seem to want that before this. And so the fear is that Hamas’s atrocities become the excuse for something that the far right in Israel could not have achieved before, but now it has a political and military space to try to achieve. So can you first say what a Nakba is, what that word means in this context, and then whether you think that’s a reasonable fear?

peter beinart

Yeah, so Nakba is the Arabic word for catastrophe. And it describes the experience in which more than half of the Palestinian population was expelled or fled in fear during Israel’s war of independence, between, essentially, 1947 and 1949. But the point that Palestinians make again and again is that in a certain sense the Nakba never ended because there have been expulsions that have continued — drips and drabs. There was another large one in 1967. In some ways, it wouldn’t even be the second Nakba. You could actually say it would be the third Nakba. And smaller scale every year in between in various ways. Most of the people in Gaza — and I don’t think this is sufficiently recognized in the mainstream American press sometimes — are not from Gaza. They are the children and grandchildren and some are original refugees who were forced from what is now Israel. And there is this profound collective trauma about the fact that this is happening again. We know from what we’ve seen in the United States in recent years, the way that things in the deep history of a country, if they’re never dealt with, if they’re never acknowledged, if there’s never a process of reparation and historical justice, they remain there waiting for a moment of trauma to come back. So when Israel said, leave the Northern Gaza Strip and go to the Southern Gaza Strip, many Palestinians, especially elderly Palestinians, were saying, I will not leave, because this is happening again. We know we will not be allowed to return. This is a very, very real threat that exists at this moment. And the American government needs to have, as one of its central policy goals, to ensure that Joe Biden is not judged by history as an American president who allowed yet another Nakba to take place on his watch.

spencer ackerman

I would add to that that before this past weekend, a tremendous amount of effort from the Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and the Biden administration was to create this, what they would call humanitarian corridor that they suggested would be a way of getting Palestinians out of Gaza into Sinai from the onslaught that Israel plans to put on Gaza. And they had to hear not just from Palestinians, who I’m not sure that they really properly interacted with, but from the regional governments, that that was — and this was Blinken’s term — a non starter, because everyone in the region, Palestinian and non Palestinan, recognized the historical reference point of the Nakba. I talked on Sunday, right after this began happening, with a formerly Palestinian-American who now lives in Turkey, named Sami Al-Arian, someone whom the war on terror railroaded out of this country. And I asked him about the intensification that Gaza was about to experience. We were talking in the context of a piece I was doing for The Nation about the Americans’ efforts to put together a Saudi normalization with Israel in the context of the war. And he said, what else can they do? And I said, well, for instance, they could push you out of Gaza. And he said, that’s a fantasy. That’s a fantasy of the right. We’re not leaving. And I can’t stop thinking of these words that he said afterwards, which is that if we have to die, we’ll die in our homes. That now a government that purports to speak for the safety and national aspirations of Jews worldwide is inflicting upon another people. I cannot think of a less Jewish thing than to make another person a refugee. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

So recognizing, Peter, this is a very hard question to put to anybody, but something that I think people will think hearing this is, look, it’s easy sitting in New York to criticize. But as you said very eloquently earlier, one way this is different than 9/11 is that Israel and Gaza abud each other. The West Bank — that everybody is crammed in together. So what would a moral response be, and not just a moral response, but one that took seriously the Israeli people’s need for security? And also, and I think this is not just a fair, but an important question of statecraft, that it can’t be costless to slaughter Israeli civilians and take Israeli hostages. I mean, no country on Earth would allow that.

peter beinart

So first of all, there has to be an effort to bring back these captives. And although this has very, very little purchase, probably, in Israel, I think if your number one overriding goal is the safety of those people, Israel would need to consider some kind of prisoner swap with Hamas, perhaps for elderly Palestinian prisoners who represent no actual threat once they leave prison. I agree that the people who masterminded this attack, the people who carried those attacks, those people are war criminals. They should be dealt with. They should be brought to justice. Beyond that, my fear is that Israel is going to go into Gaza on the ground looking for security and safety, and what it’s ultimately going to get is less safety and less security than it has today.

ezra klein

Doesn’t a mass prisoner swap for the hostages create the incentive for Hamas to do this again and again? I mean, as Spencer said earlier, consensus view is one thing Hamas wanted out of this was a bunch of Israeli civilian hostages because they have done prisoner swaps in the past. And they saw that as a way to do another one here. To give them what they wanted on that, doesn’t that just create a reason for them to keep doing it, to make this a successful strategy for them?

peter beinart

Absolutely, that is a very real danger of that strategy. But I also fear that what Israel is doing now is going to lead ultimately to Hamas being stronger. And I don’t think that’s because all those Palestinians who are supporting Hamas believe in the killing of civilians. Some do tragically, but many don’t. It’s because they have seen no other form of resistance that has gotten them anywhere. Israel has been blockading Gaza for 17 years. When the blockade began, Hamas’s rockets were these very, very primitive things. 17 years later, their arsenal is much more formidable than it was. And they were able to do this. This is not a good trajectory to be on for the safety of Israelis. Fundamentally, Palestinians are going to resist their oppression because all human beings resist their oppression.

ezra klein

There’s an interesting piece by Amjad Iraqi in the London Review of Books. And he writes, quote, “Young Palestinians — many of whom were raised under the false promises of the Oslo Accords signed 30 years ago last month — have been taking up arms and joining local militias unaffiliated with the major political parties. On the streets and online, Palestinian activists no longer care to tiptoe around diplomatic language or references to international laws that have failed them.” And I feel like it’s something we’ve seen before, that even if you imagine a world where Israel’s quite successful in smashing Hamas, that doesn’t necessarily mean the world you get is no extremist violent groups dedicated to killing Israelis. That what you might get is a splintering into somewhat yet more extreme and dangerous groups that have no political arm whatsoever, which Hamas is this weird kind of — it has a political arm. It has a military arm. You’ve watched this kind of thing happen before. So I’m curious what you make of it? It reminds me a little bit of the pre-ISIS conversation and the post-ISIS conversation. And ISIS has been back here as a metaphor a lot. But as you mentioned in the piece, not being used as a way you might think that metaphor would be used.

spencer ackerman

When the United States invaded Iraq, there was barely any Al Qaeda presence there. That quickly changed, and it became home to the most violent, nihilistic and ambitious affiliate of Al Qaeda. And then when the United States, in 2006, ‘07, ‘08, believed that it had dealt a fatal blow to that organization, that, along with the Syrian Civil War next door, combined to create an enemy far greater, far more loathsome and terrifying than the one that the United States went into Iraq to stop. We have seen this again and again and again in conditions of occupation, apartheid, strangulation, whereby, as these conditions persist, they don’t empower the levelest heads among us. They create despair, and despair will have a reaction. Despair will emerge in ways that we who do not experience that despair will find barbaric, probably correctly so in many cases, and more importantly, won’t anticipate. Only when you deal at the root with addressing the fundamental conditions of that despair can this dynamic change at all. And to expect this to be an exception is to be blind to a history that we have seen unfold not just in our lifetimes, but across 75 years of Israeli history and American sponsorship.

peter beinart

People act as if this conflict began with Hamas. Palestinians were fighting against Israel and Zionism, including by killing civilians. For instance, in the hijackings of the 1970s, the 1972 Munich Olympics. And that was not Hamas. Hamas didn’t exist. That wasn’t Islamists. Those were largely — a lot of them were leftist Palestinian organizations. So anyone who thinks you are going to end Palestinian attacks on civilians even if you could get rid of Hamas, unless you deal with the root of the violence of oppression, it seems to me is kidding themselves.

ezra klein

Something you often hear said is why isn’t there a nonviolent Palestinian movement? Why can’t this be more like the anti-Apartheid movement in South Africa? Why can’t it be more like the Gandhian independence movement in India? And you wrote a great piece for The Times kind of thinking through, particularly, the South African comparison. So how do you contrast that? And what is your answer to why the path of violence has been chosen and the path of nonviolence seems so now dormant?

peter beinart

Well, the African National Congress was not nonviolent. In the early 1960s, they actually adopted armed struggle. And yet, they worked pretty hard to not go after civilians. They felt like that was a moral red line, rightly. And the argument that I made in my piece — of course, there are many, many differences between these two situations — is to understand how the A.N.C. was able to maintain that moral code in which, at one point, they took responsibility and virtually apologized after some of their cadres, their commandos had killed civilians, was that their moral strategy was working. They saw that, by the 1980s, an anti-Apartheid movement had emerged across the world, including in the United States, led by the Black community in the United States in particular, that had gotten to impose sanctions, that had led to divestment efforts. And it produced a virtuous cycle that made it easier for them to maintain their moral core. Now, Hamas has never had the same moral core that the A.N.C. had, to be clear. But there are many Palestinians who have spoken in the language of human rights and international law and coexistence and opposed violence against civilians and called for boycotts and called for sanctions and tried to go to the International Criminal Court and tried to go to the United Nations. Tragically, in my view, unlike what we were able to do in America in the 1980s, which was to strengthen and empower those people, those people have been shut down, not just defeated, but often criminalized. I’m not saying that everyone needs to sign up to every aspect of the boycott divestment sanction movement. But if there is no form of ethical or nonviolent Palestinian resistance that you support, then you were just telling Palestinians they should accept their oppression in silence, you are going to empower Hamas.

spencer ackerman

And not just accept their oppression in silence, disappear from the face of the Earth. Every single day Palestinians experience violence. That was true before Oct. 7. It is true certainly in the wake of it. What happened to a Palestinian nonviolent effort? Well, part of it is Israel killed those people. Israel put their leaders in jail. I’m so old that I remember — I guess back in the mid-2000s when people talked about the importance of releasing Marwan Barghouti from prison on the idea that he was a way out of the P.L.O. and Hamas in a different way.

ezra klein

Do you want to say who he is?

spencer ackerman

A Palestinian leader who tried to forge a different path, who emerged from conditions of violent resistance but was trying to move toward a different form of national struggle. And this also is an important point here. The United States, as a matter of policy, suppressed that. The United States rejected Palestinian aspirations at the United Nations, vetoed resolutions. Peter probably knows more than I do how many states in the United States it is forbidden to have any involvement with boycott, divestment and sanctions, where there are penalties for state interaction with those movements and those efforts. And more fundamentally, continued to fund and arm Israel and provide it diplomatic support while it suppressed legitimate Palestinian national aspirations. And so I find it a little frustrating, certainly not as frustrating as a Palestinian would, but frustrating to hear from people who have no intention of honoring and bringing about Palestinian national aspirations, that they just don’t do it the right way. The fact of the matter is people deserve freedom because they are people. And that I think speaks to a reality that we as Americans tend not to acknowledge.

ezra klein

And my sense, Spencer, is that in the same pier, there’s this very sharp break around the role America is trying to play. Barack Obama didn’t get a lot done here. But one thing he did try to do, more so than any president since Carter, was challenge Israel on the settlements. And I would say he had a showdown with Netanyahu on that and he lost.

spencer ackerman

Not only did he lose — I remember, in 2010, when Joe Biden went as an envoy to secure the first steps toward a return to the peace process. And Netanyahu’s response was to announce more settlement construction.

ezra klein

A very direct snub. I mean, that was very, very calculated.

spencer ackerman

And it was hard not to think about that as Netanyahu and Biden embraced. Forgive me for being the war on terror guy who constantly goes back to the war on terror, but among the things that happened during that period was the war on terror in which the position of the United States, certainly beginning in September of 2001, was that Israel was fighting in microcosm the circumstance that the United States was fighting. And accordingly, there was no appetite to prompt Israel to return to any kind of negotiating posture when the prevailing view in Washington, and certainly embraced by the Israelis because of how well it suited them, was that the Palestinians were no different, functionally, from Al Qaeda. And that was a false equivalence that many in American politics and media were not particularly inclined to question. And as those conditions continued, Israel built its wall around the West Bank, which was a term people policed very heavily so as not to call it a wall. And I think it’s very obvious that it was and remains a wall. That the United States reached the thing that we constantly talk about in this day and age not reaching, which is normalization. Normalization of the persistent immiseration of the Palestinian people. Normalization of the sense that I think Peter has discussed quite eloquently of — and Tareq Baconi cited as well — a certain equilibrium that we saw on Oct. 7 where it leads. That if you would simply find a way to ignore Palestinian national aspirations and the basic facts of Palestinian material life, that the region would simply move on, that Israel would find normalization from the Gulf States and eventually Saudi Arabia. And whatever else it is that Hamas might have sought to achieve, unrealistically through its attacks beginning on Oct. 7, that equilibrium has indeed been shattered. And the United States, were it to recognize itself as a central actor that it, in fact, is in this conflict, would come to a deep reckoning of the way in which it enabled this circumstance to take root and adjust course accordingly.

ezra klein

I’ve been very struck watching Biden. A lot of what he has said actually is opposed to things that have come out elsewhere in his administration I felt has been pretty on point. But the degree of immediate locking arms with Israel and Netanyahu, knowing him a bit, and knowing his history on these issues, knowing his fury after what happened with Netanyahu in the Obama administration, I’ve wondered a little bit about his longer term play. That something that was happening in Israeli-American politics is that Israel is becoming right-wing coded. It was becoming something that Democrats had more complicated feelings on. Netanyahu had embraced Trump very fulsomely. Joe Biden is a guy who likes to imagine himself like one of the great diplomatic presidents of all time. As a Senate Foreign Relations Chair, he likes doing his shuttle diplomacy. And he seems to me to be trying to rebuild a role for America as a broker, possibly at the cost of its capability of bringing together other players in the region. But trying to rebuild its influence in Israel, hopefully with, on his part, some end game. But that has struck me as a possible way of reading just the level of intense support and political capital he’s invested in this immediately.

spencer ackerman

The people who formed the highest echelons of the Biden administration were the people who formed the second highest echelons of the Obama administration. And particularly amongst his Middle East people, their takeaway from the experience is that Obama’s instincts throughout the Middle East failed and were a mess, that toward the end of the Obama administration, after the Iran deal, there was a strain that, I think it’s fair to say, the Biden administration has run with as the centrality of its foreign policy toward the Middle East. And that is, embrace the old autocrats as hard as you can. Embrace the Petro states as hard as you can. Recognize that nothing you will want to see accomplished in the rest of the world will happen unless you unwind things like the way that Biden called Saudi Arabia a pariah state. It took the better part of a year for that to unwind. And a central aspect of that experience was seeing the ways in which efforts by Obama to impose the barest outlines of a political settlement for a two-state solution on Israel came to nothing but tears, needless antagonism and struggle, and the acceleration of that what you call right-wing codedness. Biden wants none of that smoke. Absolutely none of it. I think it is fair to question, after Oct. 7, the degree to which that strategy lies in ruins to simply look past as so much of the world and look past Israeli apartheid and the conditions of Palestinian deprivation and consider that a footnote to a glorious history in which the United States has this seamless interoperable network — this is often how they describe it from a security perspective — in which it is the security guarantor of the Middle East, and relations in the region with a rising China remain commercial and transactional, and that will secure the American position in the Middle East for generations to come. It doesn’t look like that’s really working out. And we should also just say we have not seen the end of the way this war looks. Every day I wake up scared and checking the newsfeeds to see if a second front has opened up in Southern Lebanon. That’s a real possibility here. The United States has two aircraft carrier strike groups quite possibly to assist in an assault should Hezbollah decide to enter the war in force, at which point you really do have an expanded regional war that the United States is in directly. And I don’t know if the United States has really thought through the degree to which it itself is very close to being a combatant in this conflict.

ezra klein

I’m curious what you read and what the United States wants here?

peter beinart

I think the most generous interpretation is that Biden believes that if he hugs Netanyahu and he wins credibility among Israelis, he may have the leverage to, behind the scenes, restrain what Israel does, so it’s not totally apocalyptic. It doesn’t spur the regional war or the overthrow of the Jordanian regime or the overthrow of Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank. That he can do that behind the scenes. That he kind of reasons that Obama didn’t have credibility in Israel — partly because of who he was, but partly because of public confrontation — so he’s going to do the opposite. But I think history will not be kind to the Biden administration’s way of approaching with this. They just didn’t have any stomach for any political fight in Washington to do anything for the Palestinians and essentially acted as if that could just be managed as they went off to fight their new Cold War with China and then to deal with Russia. And they contributed to this feeling among Palestinians that they were being more and more marginalized, that they were more and more hopeless, and that contributed, that empowered Hamas to take this action. And so part of the problem is they have accepted a political reality in Washington that essentially says you can’t have a fight with Israel. But by accepting that political reality, they have also strengthened that political reality. If a Democratic president had tried to do something different, given what we see among polling shifts among Democrats out there in the country, and actually led, he could have potentially changed the politics. Instead, what Joe Biden has done is he’s essentially strengthened a kind of consensus in Washington that many grass roots Democrats don’t support. And by doing so, I think he contributed to this explosion.

ezra klein

But do you think it changes now? I mean, do you think there is something to the idea that if Biden is able to win back credibility for democratic administration in Israel at a point of weakness for Netanyahu, when the U.S. government at this point was doing a lot of deals and working with the Gulf States — I mean, the idea that the equilibrium — that you can just forget about the Palestinian problem — has been shattered is true in America, too. That’s true for the Biden administration, too. I do not want to suggest that all this ends in a happy ending. I basically couldn’t believe anything further from the truth. But I do wonder if there is not an opening here, if things do not go too far off the rails in the immediate near term, to try to begin the work that was being done before of are there not deals that can be made, are there not people who can be empowered, is there not some legacy other than the continuing dissolution of this?

peter beinart

I think it would be very difficult with this Israeli government given how radical it is. And I fear that the Biden administration, if it manages to somehow avert a regional catastrophe, will of go back and say, OK, things are now OK now. The best case scenario might be, in the short-term, that there is some Israeli election that produces some kind of political earthquake. Now, that political earthquake could lead Israel even further to the right. We have no idea really what it would mean. But things have been deeply destabilized. And in the best case scenario, perhaps you might, especially because of the forces that were leading against this judicial overhaul, that maybe there could be some new political leadership in Israel that Biden could work with and do something that no American government and no Israeli government has ever done, which is restrain settlement growth, for instance. We’ve never done that. Israel has never done that, even during the peace process. That would be, I think, the best case scenario. It wouldn’t even bring us close to some kind of resolution. But it might at least create some kind of hope for Palestinians that they’re not just looking into despair as far as the eye can see. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

One thing that was in the piece you wrote, Peter, is a kind of idea that I’ve been thinking about since then, of the tactics that generate a response, that generate a kind of success then empower the people behind them. And you get into these cycles, right? Hardliners have a tendency to empower hardliners. Hamas throws rockets at Israel and gets some concessions. Hamas kidnaps an Israeli soldier and actually does get a prisoner swap. And that makes Hamas look stronger. Netanyahu’s government is able to wall off the Palestinians, and build an Iron Dome, and fortify the wall, and attacks are going down and that makes him look stronger. Or similarly, there’s an attack and now you need the hard right, you need the more military-oriented leaders, because, of course, you have to avenge the attack. And so you write that in the case of South Africa, that ethical resistance elicited international support, and international support made ethical resistance easier to sustain. And in Israel today, the dynamic is almost exactly the opposite. So I guess this raises this kind of deep question for me, which is I’ve long ago given up on the idea that there is some kind of fantasy dealmaking to imagine here, that I can kind of in my head imagine the land swaps and the right of return dynamics and all the things that would get to a deal. I think the thing you’re getting at in that piece, which is really quite powerful, is that until there are different empowered actors, there can be no deal. You have to change the political economy of the whole thing. You have to change who has strength. And I’m curious how you think that gets done.

peter beinart

We’re so far away from it. But I do think that one thing would be really important is 20 percent of Israel’s citizens are Palestinians. They are a really important group of people. Because although they’re severely discriminated against, they’re the only Palestinians who actually have the ability to act politically, to vote. The problem in Israeli politics — one major problem is that there is no genuine joint Jewish and Palestinian party. The parties are essentially all based on tribe, on various different kinds of tribes. And so you don’t have a party that even models the vision of the kind of politics that I would ultimately like to see. And if such a party could emerge and speak to Israelis and Palestinians, because it would be composed of Israelis and Palestinians, and say the way we behave in this party, coming together around a vision of humanity and equality under the law and liberal democracy, and fighting for it together as Jews and Palestinians inside Israel, I think that could resonate around the whole world and show a model of what might be possible. We desperately need models of what’s possible now for people not to lose all hope.

spencer ackerman

I agree that it looks as far away as it’s ever looked. But at the same time, I remember that when the United States imposes conditions on its allies and foreign clients, quite a great deal that doesn’t seem possible could, in fact, become possible. If the United States is, as the Biden administration has done thus far, simply express solidarity with Israel, give it accelerated ammunition shipments, then we won’t have any of those incentives created. We won’t have any actors who could break this dynamic empowered. We won’t have movements and constituencies for Palestinian liberation taken seriously and sat across a negotiating table from Israel. I don’t pretend that my perspective holds much in the way of a constituency in Israel right now. So I want to speak with some humbleness. But the thing is what’s possible is very often different from what’s necessary. And only when people of conscience hold true to what’s necessary, can we start to expand the limits of what is possible, until finally a way pointing out of this horrific reality can come to pass. And that’s something that is not something that Israel would be granting Palestinians. It would be something Israel would be performing for the survival of its own people, the people who we have, particularly in the Jewish community in Israel and around the world, been agonizing over the fate of.

ezra klein

I want to make sure some of the competing Israeli narratives are felt here. And one of the very dominant ones has been that there were efforts towards peace, or many, many peace processes, and obviously the narratives of what happened at places like Camp David and in this or that negotiation are highly contested — I’m not going to try to untangle them here — but that it fundamentally, to many Israelis, didn’t work. There wasn’t enough of a negotiating partner. Intifadas got launched. There were still rockets coming over. There were suicide bombings. And then it seemed to me — and this was a very depressing thing to watch happen — that a new consensus emerged, like, we’re done with that. The far right in Israel was highly empowered. We’re going to cordon off Gaza, cordon off the West Bank, have a blockade on Gaza, build the Iron Dome, build the wall, have intelligence operations mow the lawn by which it was a very bloodless way of saying launch repeated attacks to try to degrade the capabilities of Hamas, in particular, and other terrorist groups. And that within that there are demands placed, if this is going to change, on the Palestinians, too. I mean, and particularly now that Israel has just suffered this attack. And so I’m curious how you think about that side of it as well. And in particular, what builds trust for Israelis?

peter beinart

Right. And that’s why I, like Spencer, am so afraid of the idea of mass ethnic cleansing, because, I think, if you’ve written off the possibility of giving people equality within the country in which they live, which is essentially Israel because they live under Israeli control in various ways, and you have given up on the idea of partition and says it’s no longer possible, and you’ve given up on this idea of what the Palestinian writer Tareq Baconi calls the kind of violent equilibrium in which you can manage this, then what are you left with but the idea of trying to get those people out of there. I would say, first of all, it is very important for Israeli Jews and people around the world to know that there are Palestinians who have condemned these attacks, who have said that it is fundamentally antithetical to them to take civilian life of any group. Ayman Odeh, for instance, who’s just about the most important — one of the most important Palestinian political leaders in Israel has said that unequivocally. Adalah, an organization of Palestinian Israelis. There have been people who have said that. I think it’s really important that we don’t lose their voices in this. On the question of what happened during all these negotiations, both Palestinians and Israeli Jews believed that the other side was not acting in good faith. And if you really go through all of the details, I think what you come to at the end of the day is that they had two different conceptions of what this partition would look like that could never be bridged. But since Netanyahu came back to power in 2009, we have not had an Israeli government that has been interested in a Palestinian state on any terms. So even if you say that Yasir Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas deserve blame for what happened in 2000, 2001, 2007, 2008 — and I think there is blame to go around — the problem with blaming the Palestinians since 2009 is there has been no Israeli partner to even test their willingness to accept the idea of a Palestinian state near the 1967 lines in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

ezra klein

So let me begin to bring this to a close, and not with imaginings of a deal that isn’t going to happen, but with a more direct question, which is — I agree with your point, Peter, that with this Israeli government it’s very hard to imagine that kind of change. Who are figures — political leaders, thinkers, people with a constituency of some sort — on both sides of the conflict who you all have seen, heard from, and who are the kind of people you wish would begin to hold more power? Are there people who are for you folks charting a pathway forward that has some glimmers of something different?

spencer ackerman

I think Ayman Odeh is someone who does not command a substantial constituency in Israel — and we shouldn’t underestimate the left’s nearly 20-year marginalization in Israel — but, as Peter pointed out earlier, is someone whose politics represents something outside of the zero-sum nature of what Israeli politics that we’re seeing with the Netanyahu government represents. And like Peter says, we don’t know the direction of a government that may take shape in response to fury at Netanyahu that Israelis have expressed for the last nearly two weeks over this. But that fury is not necessarily a left wing fury. That fury very often has to do with the ways in which Netanyahu’s gamble did not yield security. And the question is going to be what Israelis take away from that lesson. Was the failure in security simply a failure of sufficiently militarizing Israel toward the South and away from the West Bank, or was it a more fundamental failure in which the policy of keeping Hamas strong and funded in order to never have to divest Israel of the West Bank was the fundamental failure here?

ezra klein

Peter, do you have any other people who spring to mind in that?

peter beinart

Yes, I think I mentioned in passing this group, which is in English called “Standing Together,” led by Sally Abed and Alon-Lee Green and many others. It’s an organization of Israeli and Palestinian citizens who, under the most extraordinarily difficult circumstances, especially now where they’re literally facing state repression, have tried to offer a vision of Israeli Jews and Palestinians standing together for mutual safety, mutual equality and coexistence. And those people give me hope.

ezra klein

Are there any politicians in Israel that you find — and here I mean actually Jewish politicians. The collapse of the Israeli left has been so stark from when I started being involved in this issue in my 20s or in my teens. Does anybody feel to you like they have any hope of reviving something?

peter beinart

The problem is in this — I think in this idea of the Jewish left. We would not talk in the United States about the white left or the Christian left. Inherent in being in the left is you don’t stand for tribe. And the problem in Israeli politics is there is not a robust politics that essentially sees itself as neither Jewish, nor Palestinian. There is a Jewish member of the Knesset in the Hadash party, which is a mostly Palestinian party. That man, Ofer Cassif, was just basically banned from the Knesset for 45 days for public statements he made, just to give you a sense of how difficult it is to occupy that. But those are the people that I look to.

ezra klein

And then always our final question, what are three books you’d recommend to the audience? And Spencer, why don’t I start with you?

spencer ackerman

Sure. So three books, and I appreciate the question, Ezra. First, I would recommend reading “The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine,” by the historian Rashid Khalidi. That is a Palestinian — a very accessible Palestinian history as precis to the conflict beginning of the 20th century to the early 21st. A shattering book that people really ought to read is “An Oral History of the Palestinian Nakba.” That’s edited by Nahla Abdo and Nur Masalha. Reading the history from the people who experienced the Nakba around 1948 and periods both before and after is, for those who know Jewish history, shattering in its familiarity. And reading, as well, the accounts of people who survived the Nakba, who talk about how these were their neighbors, people that they loved, their children played with, who they had all sorts of social relationships with for a long period of time, turn on them and force them away is a shattering thing to remember and to hear. And then finally, I would recommend Benny Morris and my former Guardian colleague Ian Black’s book, “Israel’s Secret Wars,” which is a history of the rise of the Israeli intelligence services and their role in statecraft in Israel. Also has some simply incredible stories that are amazing to believe are true.

ezra klein

Peter?

peter beinart

Because this has been a conversation among Jews and I know you’re going to have Palestinian guests, I’m going to mention three books by Palestinians, not because there are not so many books by Israeli Jews that I love, but just because since Palestinians have often had, as Edward Said said this, not had this permission to narrate, I think it’s really important in this moment that their voices be elevated. The first is Edward Said’s classic book, “The Question of Palestine,” in 1979, which really lays out the Palestinian experience. And what I love about that book and find so moving about it is it’s a very, very profound critique of Zionism. And yet, Said is such a humanist that he’s also able to describe in that book to understand why Zionism was so appealing to so many Jews and why many Jews found it liberating even as he found it to be oppressive, and Palestinians did. The second is Raja Shehadeh’s memoir, “Strangers in the House.” Spencer mentioned the Nakba. This is the story of growing up in a family of people who were expelled. And it gives you an intimate glimpse into that refugee experience, which is so central to the Palestinian experience, and yet I feel like so often is missing from the American discourse about Israel-Palestine. And the third is — we’ve mentioned Tareq Baconi before — Tareq Baconi’s book, “Hamas Contained.” It’s a book about Hamas, which has no illusions, which is very, very critical in parts, but describes the history of Hamas as a political organization that one can understand certain decisions it’s made in response to certain incentives. And if there is to be a better future for Israelis and Palestinians than the one that Hamas envisions, part of that will require understanding Hamas better so that Jews and Palestinians together can create better alternatives.

ezra klein"
419,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/opinion/palestine-war-empathy.html,"I’ve moved back to the United States twice since my birth. Once as a child, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Then again for graduate school. I’d had the privilege of a youth — adolescence and young adulthood — in countries where being Palestinian was fairly common. The identity could be heavy, but it wasn’t a contested one. I hadn’t had to learn the respectability politics of being a Palestinian adult. I learned quickly.

The task of the Palestinian is to be palatable or to be condemned. The task of the Palestinian, we’ve seen in the past two weeks, is to audition for empathy and compassion. To prove that we deserve it. To earn it.

In the past couple of weeks, I’ve watched Palestinian activists, lawyers, professors get baited and interrupted on air, if not silenced altogether. They are being made to sing for the supper of airtime and fair coverage. They are begging reporters to do the most basic tasks of their job. At the same time, Palestinians fleeing from bombs have been misidentified. Even when under attack, they must be costumed as another people to elicit humanity. Even in death, they cannot rest — Palestinians are being buried in mass graves or in old graves dug up to make room, and still there is not enough space.

If that weren’t enough, Palestinian slaughter is too often presented ahistorically, untethered to reality: It is not attributed to real steel and missiles, to occupation, to policy. To earn compassion for their dead, Palestinians must first prove their innocence. The real problem with condemnation is the quiet, sly tenor of the questions that accompany it: Palestinians are presumed violent — and deserving of violence — until proved otherwise. Their deaths are presumed defensible until proved otherwise. What is the word of a Palestinian against a machinery that investigates itself, that absolves itself of accused crimes? What is it against a government whose representatives have referred to Palestinians as “human animals” and “wild beasts”? When a well-suited man can say brazenly and unflinchingly that there is no such thing as a Palestinian people?

It is, of course, a remarkably effective strategy. A slaughter isn’t a slaughter if those being slaughtered are at fault, if they’ve been quietly and effectively dehumanized — in the media, through policy — for years. If nobody is a civilian, nobody can be a victim.

***

In 2017, I published a novel about a Palestinian family. It was published by a respectable publisher, got a lot of lovely press, was given a book tour. I spoke on panels, to book clubs. I answered questions after readings. There was a refrain that kept coming up. People kept commenting on how human the story was. You’ve humanized the conflict. This is a human story.

Of course, literature and the arts play a crucial role in providing context — expanding our empathy, granting us glimpses into other worlds. But every time I was told I’d humanized the Palestinians, I would have to suppress the question it invoked: What had they been before?

A couple of weeks ago, in a professional space, someone called Palestinians by name and spoke of the seven decades of their anguish. I sat among dozens of co-workers and realized my lip was quivering. I was crying before I understood it was happening. I fled the room, and it took 10 minutes for me to stop sobbing. I didn’t immediately understand my reaction. Over the years, I’ve faced meetings, classrooms and other institutional spaces where Palestinians went unnamed or were referred to only as terrorists. I came of professional age in a country where people lost all sorts of things for speaking of Palestine: social standing, university tenure, journalist positions. But in the end, I am undone not by silence or erasure but by empathy. By the simple naming of my people. By increasing recognition that liberation is linked. By spaces of Palestinian-Jewish solidarity. By what has become controversial: the simple speaking aloud of Palestinian suffering.

These days, everyone is trying to write about the children. An incomprehensible number of them dead and counting. We are up at night, combing through the flickering light of our phones, trying to find the metaphor, the clip, the photograph to prove a child is a child. It is an unbearable task. We ask: Will this be the image that finally does it? This half-child on a rooftop? This video, reposted by Al Jazeera, of an inconsolable girl appearing to recognize her mother’s body among the dead, screaming out, “It’s her, it’s her. I swear it’s her. I know her from her hair”?

***

Take it from a writer: There is nothing like the tedium of trying to come up with analogies. There is something humiliating in trying to earn solidarity. I keep seeing infographics desperately trying to appeal to American audiences. Imagine most of the population of Manhattan being told to evacuate in 24 hours. Imagine the president of [ ] going on NBC and saying all [ ] people are [ ]. Look! Here’s a strip on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea. That’s Gaza. It is about the same size as Philadelphia. Or multiply the entire population of Las Vegas by three.

This is demoralizing work, to have to speak constantly in the vernacular of tragedies and atrocities, to say: Look, look. Remember? That other suffering that was eventually deemed unacceptable? Let me hold it up to this one. Let me show you proportion. Let me earn your outrage. Absent that, let me earn your memory. Please.

I don’t hesitate for a second to condemn the killing of any child, any massacre of civilians — this of course includes Jewish life. It is the easiest ask in the world. And it is not in spite of that but because of that I say: Condemn the brutalization of bodies. By all means, do. Condemn murder. Condemn violence, imprisonment, all forms of oppression. But if your shock and distress comes only at the sight of certain brutalized bodies? If you speak out but not when Palestinian bodies are besieged and murdered, abducted and imprisoned? Then it is worth asking yourself which brutalization is acceptable to you, even quietly, even subconsciously, and which is not.

Name the discrepancy and own it. If you can’t be equitable, be honest.

There is nothing complicated about asking for freedom. Palestinians deserve equal rights, equal access to resources, equal access to fair elections and so forth. If this makes you uneasy, then you must ask yourself why.

***

Here is the truth of the diasporic Palestinians: They are not magically diasporic. Their diaspora-ness is a direct result of often violent, intentional and illegal dispossession. One day a house is yours; one day it is not. One day a neighborhood is yours; one day it is not. One day a territory is yours; one day it is not. This same sort of dispossession is grounded in the same mind-set and international complicity that is playing out in Gaza.

I’m a poet, a writer, a psychologist. I’m deeply familiar with the importance of language. I’ve agonized over an em dash. I’ve spent afternoons muttering about the aptness of a verb. I pay attention to language, my own and others. Being Palestinian in this country — in many countries — is a numbing exercise in gauging where pockets of safety are, sussing out which friends, co-workers or acquaintances will be allies, which will stay silent. Who will speak.

Here’s another thing I know as a writer and psychologist: It matters where you start a narrative. In addiction work, you call this playing the tape. Diasporically or not, being Palestinian is the quintessential disrupter: It messes with a curated, modified tape. We exist, and our existence presents an existential affront. As long as we exist, we challenge several falsehoods, not the least of which is that, for some, we never existed at all. That decades ago, a country was born in the delicious, glittering expanse of nothingness — a birthright, something due. Our very existence challenges a formidable, militarized narrative.

But the days of the Palestine exception are numbered. Palestine is increasingly becoming the litmus test for true liberatory practice.

In the meantime, Palestinians continue to be cast paradoxically — both terror and invisible, both people who never existed and people who cannot return.

Imagine being such a pest, such an obstacle. Or: Imagine being so powerful."

The New York Times on Monday published an editors’ note about its coverage of an explosion on Oct. 17 at a hospital in Gaza City. The initial report, which included a large headline across The Times’s website, led with claims by Hamas government officials that the explosion was caused by an Israeli airstrike.

According to the editors’ note, however, The Times’s initial accounts “relied too heavily on claims by Hamas, and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately be verified.”

The note continued: “The report left readers with an incorrect impression about what was known and how credible the account was.”

421,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/business/media/writers-guild-israel-hamas.html,"Just weeks after the Writers Guild of America displayed solidarity by ending a monthslong strike and voting overwhelmingly in favor of a new contract with the major entertainment companies, the union is being roiled by a fight over its lack of a public statement condemning the Hamas attack on Israel.

On Oct. 15, eight days after the attack, a group of screenwriters signed an open letter to the Writers Guild asking why it had not issued a statement condemning the attack. They noted that other major Hollywood unions had issued such statements. The letter now has more than 300 signers, including Jerry Seinfeld, Amy Sherman-Palladino (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”) and Gideon Raff (“Homeland”).

It questioned why the Writers Guild had previously made public remarks in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and #MeToo reckoning but remained silent “when terrorists invaded Israel to murder, rape and kidnap Jews.”

On Friday, 75 members of the guild took part in a Zoom meeting to discuss what to do about the silence. Options included withholding dues until the guild leadership convenes a proper conversation on the issue with its membership, according to a person who attended the discussion and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of its delicate nature. Other members are considering resigning from the guild by filing for financial core status, in which they would pay reduced dues and still receive the contractual benefits of the collective bargaining agreement.

Later Friday, Meredith Stiehm, the president of the Writers Guild of America West, sent an email to members who had inquired about the lack of a response. “Like the membership itself, the board’s viewpoints are varied, and we found consensus out of reach,” she wrote in the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times. “For these reasons, we have decided not to comment publicly.”

Calls to the union on Monday were not returned.

Jewish leaders have encouraged Hollywood’s biggest voices to speak out in favor of Israel.

“When celebrities speak out, it sends an important message to their tens of millions of followers that this is the right side to be on,” Jonathan Greenblatt, director of the Anti-Defamation League, wrote in an opinion piece published in The Hollywood Reporter.

“In light of how distorting social media algorithms can present the world,” he added, “it’s even more important for these voices to cut through.”

The writers’ union is not the only Hollywood organization dealing with fallout.

On Sunday, Creative Artists Agency announced to its employees that Maha Dakhil, the highest-ranking female agent in the motion picture group, had resigned from the company’s internal board and was stepping away from her leadership role within the motion picture group after posting inflammatory remarks on Instagram that accused Israel of committing genocide.

Ms. Dakhil has apologized for her comments. According to an email sent by the agency’s chief executive, Bryan Lourd, which was reviewed by The Times, she will continue to represent her clients, who include Natalie Portman, Tom Cruise and Reese Witherspoon."
422,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/us/politics/biden-state-dinner-australia-albanese-china.html,"Five months ago, President Biden canceled a trip to Australia because the United States was on the brink of defaulting on its debt, and it seemed like a bad time to be out of town. Then he extended an invitation to Anthony Albanese, the prime minister of Australia, for a state visit in Washington — a redo of sorts, when things would be calmer.

Then again, maybe there’s never really a good time.

This week, Mr. Biden is steering American involvement in two overseas wars and monitoring the continuing calamity of a speakerless House of Representatives, and there is another government shutdown crisis looming next month.

This state visit, which began on Tuesday evening and will feature a lavish dinner on Wednesday after a day of diplomacy, gives Mr. Biden an opportunity to nurture relations with an ally he sees as key to countering China, one of the president’s top priorities at a time of domestic and international tumult. John F. Kirby, a White House spokesman, played down the idea that global crises could distract Mr. Biden from his visitor, or perhaps even keep him waiting.

“Being president of the United States means balancing an awful lot of priorities and challenges, whether they’re domestic or foreign, and oftentimes the line between those blur pretty dang quickly,” Mr. Kirby told reporters on Tuesday.

The crush of news did prompt the White House to change its plans at the last minute for the entertainment portion of the visit. The B-52s, a Georgia-bred group most famous for their hits “Love Shack” and “Rock Lobster,” had been scheduled to perform, but Jill Biden, the first lady, said on Tuesday that the group would attend as guests. The U.S. Marine Band and the Army and Air Force Strolling Strings will provide instrumental music instead.

“We are now in a time when so many are facing sorrow and pain, so we made a few adjustments to the entertainment portion of the evening,” Dr. Biden said.

During Mr. Biden and Mr. Albanese’s time together, which includes a news conference scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, they are expected to emphasize their shared interests. The most crucial areas of cooperation are a joint contract with Britain to develop and deploy nuclear-powered attack submarines — which gives the United States a crucial technological edge against China — and expansion of a joint military presence in the Pacific islands, including Papua New Guinea.

The war between Israel and Hamas will also be on the agenda, Mr. Kirby said, including discussions of artificial intelligence, clean energy and fighting climate change. He said he expected several conversations about China, without offering specifics.

Bruce Jones, senior fellow at the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, said in an interview that the United States-Australia relationship has been nurtured across presidential administrations. He added that Mr. Albanese’s visit was “cementing the notion that across administrations and across party politics, Australia is really emerging as central to America’s strategy for the Indo-Pacific region.”

In 2019, President Donald J. Trump hosted Mr. Albanese’s predecessor, Scott Morrison, for a rare state visit. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Morrison were conservative leaders who rose to power on a wave of populism. Their agenda focused on intelligence sharing, joint military initiatives — including an American-led effort to protect ships from Iranian threats in the critical Strait of Hormuz — and cleaning ocean water.

Those elements of the relationship remain crucial regardless of the presidential administration, according to analysts. But the Biden administration’s emphasis on countering China — coupled with a rise in Chinese aggression and pressure tactics in the Indo-Pacific — has brought the United States into closer cooperation with Australia, even as Mr. Albanese plans to meet President Xi Jinping of China next month to discuss removing tariffs on Australian wine that China imposed during the pandemic.

“The shared sense of the objective of limiting and constraining Chinese naval and political ambitions in the region overrides the differences on trade relations,” Mr. Jones said.

Mr. Biden’s advisers say the administration is supportive of the meeting between Mr. Albanese and Mr. Xi.

Mr. Biden and Mr. Albanese are also likely to touch on the dysfunction in Congress. The Biden administration is relying on Congress to pass legislation that would allow for the shipment of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, as part of an agreement called AUKUS among the United States, Britain and Australia.

U.S. officials said on Tuesday that Mr. Biden would tell the prime minister that the United States will fulfill that promise, but it is unclear how his administration’s legislative proposal would fare in a barely functional Congress.

As for the dinner, which is scheduled for Wednesday evening, the East Wing has arranged an outdoor affair under tents on the South Lawn."

The eruption of fighting between Israel and Hamas over the weekend, which could sow disruption across the region, reflects how challenging it has become to shield economies from increasingly frequent and unpredictable global shocks. The conflict has cast a cloud over a gathering of top economic policymakers in Morocco for the annual meetings of the I.M.F. and the World Bank.

Officials who planned to grapple with the lingering economic effects of the pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine now face a new crisis.

“Economies are at a delicate state,” Ajay Banga, the World Bank president, said in an interview on the sidelines of the annual meetings. “Having war is really not helpful for central banks who are finally trying to find their way to a soft landing,” he said. Mr. Banga was referring to efforts by policymakers in the West to try to cool rapid inflation without triggering a recession."

Some of the images viewed by The Times appeared to be manipulated and edited.

Underneath some of the videos and images posted on X, people warned that they could be spread as part of a campaign to stoke fear among Israelis. Some of the accounts claimed to be working on behalf of Hamas.

Still, if Western nations considered Hamas a terrorist organization, they also thought that it was preoccupied with governing Palestinians crammed into Gaza. Hamas provided social services. It was even thought of as a restraint on what were considered even more radical groups.

In Israel, successive governments cut quiet deals with Hamas, hoping to keep a form of stability in the Gaza Strip, which the group controls, especially after the Israelis withdrew unilaterally from the territory in 2005.

But the assault launched by Hamas this weekend, with more than 900 Israelis listed as killed so far and more than 150 believed taken as hostages and human shields into Gaza, has now stripped away any remaining illusions about the group or its intentions. The attack by Hamas into Israel proper is notable for its terror, targeting not only uniformed soldiers, but also civilians, including women and children."

Former President Donald J. Trump, who has frequently presented himself as a unflinching ally of Israel and who moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in 2018, blamed Mr. Biden for the conflict.

While campaigning on Saturday in Waterloo, Iowa, he said the attacks had occurred because “we are perceived as being weak and ineffective, with a really weak leader.”

On several occasions, Mr. Trump went further, saying that the hostage deal was a catalyst of the attacks. “The war happened for two reasons,” he said. “The United States is giving — and gave to Iran — $6 billion over hostages.”"

The report included a large headline at the top of The Times’s website.

Israel subsequently denied being at fault and blamed an errant rocket launch by the Palestinian faction group Islamic Jihad, which has in turn denied responsibility. American and other international officials have said their evidence indicates that the rocket came from Palestinian fighter positions.

The Times’s initial accounts attributed the claim of Israeli responsibility to Palestinian officials, and noted that the Israeli military said it was investigating the blast. However, the early versions of the coverage — and the prominence it received in a headline, news alert and social media channels — relied too heavily on claims by Hamas, and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately be verified. The report left readers with an incorrect impression about what was known and how credible the account was.

The Times continued to update its coverage as more information became available, reporting the disputed claims of responsibility and noting that the death toll might be lower than initially reported. Within two hours, the headline and other text at the top of the website reflected the scope of the explosion and the dispute over responsibility.

Given the sensitive nature of the news during a widening conflict, and the prominent promotion it received, Times editors should have taken more care with the initial presentation, and been more explicit about what information could be verified.

429,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/opinion/gaza-hamas-hezbollah-iran.html,"The Middle East could be on the verge of a regional conflagration. That’s in stark contrast to the atmosphere of just a few weeks ago, when the Biden administration was working on sealing a historic deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel that it hoped would stabilize a region long convulsed by war and sectarianism.

Now, in the wake of Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, Israel appears to be preparing to invade Gaza. Israeli forces and the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah are firing at each other at the Lebanon border. Protests have erupted in cities across the region. The United States has moved two carrier strike groups into the eastern Mediterranean, and on Thursday a Navy warship shot down missiles and drones from Yemen that the military says may have been headed toward Israel. In a sign that the Pentagon expects similar attacks in the days ahead, on Saturday the U.S. military said it would increase its missile defense capability in the region to help protect U.S. forces.

At the center of these mounting tensions is Iran, which has been engaged in a shadow war with its chief regional rival, Israel, for years. On Oct. 10, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, applauded the deadly terrorist attack by Hamas, which is part of a loose network of nonstate armed groups that Iran uses to bolster its influence in the region. Tehran has denied any involvement in the attack, and Israeli and American officials acknowledge that there is no “direct evidence” proving otherwise. But as Iran rages over the ever-mounting casualties in Gaza and what it perceives as America’s interference, fears are growing that this on-again-off-again proxy war, waged through Hamas in the south and Hezbollah in the north, will break out into a sustained conflict, potentially even dragging in the United States.

Iran may not have ordered Hamas’s attack, but government officials in Washington believe Tehran bears responsibility for enabling Hamas to gain the military capability and expertise to carry out the complex attack that has killed at least 1,400 Israelis and captured some 200 hostages. Days after the attack, Washington and Doha, Qatar, announced that Tehran would be denied access to $6 billion that had been recently unfrozen as a result of a prisoner swap between the United States and Iran.

Each year, Iran doles out hundreds of millions of dollars to improve the combat effectiveness of Hezbollah, Hamas and other militant groups in the region, including the Houthis in Yemen and an assortment of Iraqi Shia militias. With that funding, the groups, which Tehran has supported for decades as part of its “axis of resistance,” have developed an extensive assortment of capabilities, ranging from unmanned aerial systems to high-end ballistic missile arsenals that would be the envy of most national militaries.

Training and equipping terrorists, insurgents and militias is a core element of Iran’s foreign and security policy in the Middle East. At the vanguard of this effort is the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps-Quds Force, an elite unit responsible for conducting covert activities, including the sponsorship of groups like Hamas. IRGC-QF trainers and advisers provide hands-on instruction to militants on how to plan ambushes, improve operational security and gain proficiency with emerging technologies and cutting-edge weapons systems. The success of this training was evident in the way Hamas used drones to knock out the Israel Defense Force’s cellular communications and surveillance towers along the border with Gaza in its recent attack.

Iran uses proxy forces to advance its national security objectives: pushing adversaries like the United States, which has more than 30,000 troops stationed across various facilities in the Middle East, out of the region and expanding its own sphere of influence without generating a direct military response from rivals. Proxy forces allow Tehran to meddle in ongoing conflicts in the background, maintaining a thin veneer of deniability and avoiding being pulled into a direct military confrontation with militarily superior foes — namely, Israel and the United States. It also gives Tehran leverage as its proxy groups develop political wings, helping Iran play kingmaker in local and national politics in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere.

These proxy-war tactics have been a success. Hamas and Hezbollah have inflicted serious damage in Israel without bringing the war home to Iran and have sent a clear message to Jerusalem that Tehran, if it wants to, is able to wage a campaign of asymmetric warfare that combines conventional and unconventional military capabilities.

But that paradigm may be about to change.

Many longtime Middle East watchers believe that the driving force behind Hamas’s attack was an overarching imperative — from both Hamas leadership and Tehran — to disrupt the momentum of the normalization agreement between Israel and Iran’s other longtime nemesis in the region, Saudi Arabia. And it may have worked. The images of death and destruction coming out of Gaza and the mounting death toll of Palestinian civilians could ultimately prove to be too much for Saudi Arabia to ignore. For the time being, any normalization talks between Saudi Arabia and Israel have been shelved.

But Tehran has gone much further than disrupting talks. The IRGC-QF commander, Gen. Ismail Qaani, appears to be coordinating Iran’s various proxy forces more closely, even reportedly organizing regular meetings since August between the heads of Hezbollah, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group that is active in Gaza. Accordingly, the fighting since Oct. 7 has not been limited to Gaza. Israel has launched strikes into Lebanon in response to Hezbollah missiles that have been fired into its territory. The exchange so far has followed a long-running pattern of tit-for-tat reprisals. Still, Israel, concerned that Hezbollah fighters may be preparing to ramp up attacks and launch a sustained offensive in response to an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza, has announced the evacuation of more than two dozen communities along its border with Lebanon, including one small city of some 20,000 residents.

As the conflict intensifies, there are growing concerns that Israel may be headed toward a more direct confrontation with Iran. U.S. military stationed in the region have also faced threats from Iran-backed groups in recent days. On Oct. 17, after scores of Palestinians were killed in a hospital bombing, Ayatollah Khamenei accused the United States of fomenting the chaos that is threatening to envelop the region, taking to X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter: “The Zionist regime’s policy is being regulated by the Americans,” he said. “The U.S. is responsible for the recent crimes.”

And while the Biden administration provided evidence, based on the intelligence it has seen, that the hospital strike was an errant Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket, the fuse has already been lit, with protests continuing throughout the region. Protesters tried to storm the Israeli Embassy in Amman, Jordan, and violent demonstrators targeted the Israeli consulate in Istanbul.

If Hezbollah decides to take advantage of the overstretched Israel Defense Forces and officially open up a second front on Israel’s northern border, the situation could escalate — and deteriorate — quickly. Even the slightest miscalculation by Iran or one of its proxies could result in a dramatic response by the Israelis, potentially pulling in the United States and setting the stage for a bitter regional conflict.

430,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/briefing/invasion-gaza.html,"For more than a week, an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza has seemed as if it might begin any day. Troops and tanks have crowded the border. Israel has ordered Gazans to evacuate south. The military has showered missiles on Hamas bunkers to weaken the group.

But no ground invasion has begun. Why the apparent delay?

One part of the answer is that Israel’s allies, led by President Biden, have encouraged a pause, as our colleagues reported yesterday. Biden spent much of yesterday on calls with Benjamin Netanyahu and the leaders of several European countries.

Western leaders have made clear that they support Israel invading Gaza to destroy Hamas, after an Oct. 7 terrorist attack that killed more than 1,400 people, but the leaders also hope to shape the coming invasion in four main ways:

Hostages: The U.S. wants more time for hostage negotiations. On Friday, the U.S. secured the release of two American hostages, with Qatar’s help. Israel believes Hamas may release about 50 hostages who are citizens of another country as well as Israel, but a ground invasion could make hostage releases less likely.

Defense: Biden is worried about a wider regional conflict, potentially including Iran. American officials want more time to prepare for attacks from Iran-backed groups, which they believe will intensify after the invasion. The State Department has ordered some government employees and family members to leave the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, and the Pentagon is sending more missile defense systems to the region."
431,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/us/ukraine-gaza-global-south-hypocrisy.html,"For 20 months, the Biden administration has attempted to stake out the moral high ground against Russia, condemning its brutal war on Ukraine for indiscriminately killing civilians.

The argument resonated in much of the West, but less so in other parts of the world, which viewed the war as more of a great-power conflict and declined to participate in sanctions or otherwise isolate Russia.

Now, as Israel bombards the Gaza Strip, killing more than 4,300 people since Oct. 7, the Biden administration’s unwavering support risks creating new headwinds in its efforts to win over global public opinion.

Speaking from the Oval Office on Thursday, President Biden tied American support for Ukraine and Israel together, describing both nations as democracies fighting enemies determined to “completely annihilate” them. Russia invaded and seeks to annex Ukraine, while Hamas, the group that controls Gaza and denies Israel’s right to exist, staged a terrorist attack that killed at least 1,400 people in southern Israel.

But Israel’s counterattack on Gaza, its threats to mount a ground invasion and America’s tight embrace of its most important Mideast ally, regardless, have prompted cries of hypocrisy.

Such accusations are not exactly new in the Middle East conflict. But the dynamics of the dual crises have gone beyond Washington’s desire to rally global support to isolate and punish Russia for invading its neighbor.

Increasingly, the Middle East region is emerging as a renewed front in the struggle for influence in the Global South — the collective name for the developing nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America — pitting the West against Russia and China.

“The war in the Middle East will drive a growing wedge between the West and countries like Brazil or Indonesia, key swing states of the Global South,” said Clifford Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a New York-based risk assessment organization. “That will make international cooperation on Ukraine, like sanctions enforcement on Russia, even harder.”"

Over the last 10 days, a website called anti-israel-employees.com published more than 17,000 posts, which one of the people behind the site said had been taken mainly from LinkedIn. The site, which claimed to be a “global live feed of potentially supportive sentiments for terrorism among company employees,” listed thousands of people and grouped them by their workplaces, in an apparent attempt to shame them for their sentiments on the Israeli-Hamas conflict.

The website, which was taken offline for a day before being migrated to a new web address, named employees of major international corporations, including Amazon, Mastercard and Ernst & Young, and shared their profile photos, LinkedIn pages and posts.

Itai Liptz, a hedge fund manager who said he was one of the people behind the original site, said that its goal was to “expose people who supported Hamas publicly.”

“We wanted to have it documented and a record,” he said. “If I work in this company, but I see my friends on LinkedIn celebrating and praising Hamas, then I’m not feeling safe.”"
433,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/world/middleeast/gaza-ride-south-evacuees.html,"As Israel’s military ramped up its warnings for civilians to flee northern Gaza, many people there said that doing so was not an option because of cost — and that it was no guarantee of safety.

The Israeli military said Saturday night that it would intensify its already punishing bombardment of the besieged enclave ahead of an expected ground invasion. In Arabic-language leaflets dropped over Gaza on Saturday, it reiterated calls for people to move south, warning that anyone who did not “may be considered a partner in a terrorist organization.”

But Amani Abu Odeh, who lives in the town of Jabalia in Gaza’s north, said that the danger of Israeli airstrikes on the road had pushed up the cost of travel. Drivers were now charging between $200 and $300 to take a family south, she said. Before the war, the same trip cost about $3 a person.

“We can’t even afford to eat,” Ms. Abu Odeh said. “We don’t have the money to leave.” Instead, she and other members of her extended family have hunkered down together in one home.

Food, water and other supplies are in desperately short supply in Gaza, where officials say the health system is on the brink of collapse after Israel declared a complete siege of the already blockaded enclave nearly two weeks ago.

More than half of Gaza’s more than two million residents have been displaced within the enclave, which is about the size of the city of Philadelphia, since Israel launched its retaliatory airstrike campaign. And the leaflets dropped over Gaza calling for more people to move south drew condemnation from Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories.

Designating hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians who were unwilling or unable to flee as accomplices in terrorism was a threat of collective punishment and could possibly amount to ethnic cleansing, she wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Saturday. She added that deliberately targeting civilians was a war crime.

In response to questions from The New York Times, the Israeli military said that it did not intend to consider those who have not evacuated south to be members of armed Palestinian groups, which it considers terrorist organizations. It said in a statement that it “treats civilians as such, and does not target them.” A spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry also said that there was no basis for the suggestion that its evacuation warnings could amount to ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.

Even as Israel has told Gazans to head south, airstrikes have continued to hit that part of the enclave. And an Israeli military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said on Saturday night that Israel would “deepen” attacks on Gaza overall ahead of the “next stages” of the war — a reference to a widely expected ground offensive.

That — coupled with the escalating humanitarian crisis across the enclave — is one of several reasons some families say they are staying put in the north.

“I did not go to the south mainly because I know no one there; where am I to go?” said Yasser Shaban, 57, a civil servant in Gaza City. “We will end up in the streets.”

Mr. Shaban said a cousin took his family to the south soon after airstrikes on Gaza City began in the hours after Hamas fighters attacked Israel on Oct. 7. But a week ago, he said, an Israeli airstrike hit the place where they were sheltering in the city of Khan Younis, killing the cousin’s wife and two daughters. The cousin returned to Gaza City with his surviving family members — a wounded son and his sister — to be treated at Al Shifa Hospital.

“I heard of the new leaflets saying they will consider us members of Hamas if we don’t evacuate,” Mr. Shaban said. “But I simply can’t go south.”

434,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/world/middleeast/peace-activists-israel-palestinian.html,"Awad Darawshe, shot in the abdomen, bled to death under the stage at the trance music festival that Hamas gunmen transformed into a killing field. A Palestinian Israeli paramedic, he died in a desperate attempt to save the lives of Jews at the Tribe of Nova peace-and-love gathering that marked the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.

Mr. Darawshe, 23, was at the festival as part of a small team of paramedics working for Yossi Ambulances, an Israeli company recruited to take care of routine medical emergencies. His colleagues fled when the shooting began, but he “felt compelled to help people as one human being to another,” said Mohammad Darawshe, a cousin who is himself a prominent mediator between Palestinians and Jews.

A young Palestinian Israeli citizen committed to peace and killed by Islamist Hamas terrorists in the Jewish homeland, Awad Darawshe may appear to be an apt symbol of the utter defeat of the bridge-builders still committed to a peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Yet, often marginalized, mocked as naïve and targeted as traitors, some of these stubborn advocates of peacemaking now see an opportunity, however remote, in the aftermath of Hamas’s slaughter of more than 1,400 Israelis.

The calls for a war like no other to root out Hamas “once and for all,” a consensus in Israel’s national unity government and much of Israeli society, will blunt their voices for now. The peacemakers are in the minority as a devastating invasion of Gaza looms.

But the Hamas attack has shattered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s conviction that the conflict — insoluble in his view — could be managed by “mowing the grass,” in the dismissive Israeli expression for periodic weeding out of Palestinian militancy.

That state of drift, in which peace had become a forgotten or even risible word, now feels untenable. The Israeli cultivation of Hamas, intended to ensure that Palestinians remained split between the more moderate Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and the rulers of Gaza, so making Palestinian statehood impossible, is a policy in shreds. The notion that the Palestinians would drift passively off into the ether as Israel normalized relations with Arab states like Bahrain or Morocco looks more misplaced than ever."

Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier will now be “redirected” to the Central Command’s area of responsibility, the statement said, a region that encompasses much of the Middle East, including Israel and Lebanon.

Since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing at least 1,400 Israelis, the United States has increased its troop presence in the region and sent more military supplies to Israel as Israel prepares for a possible ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. President Biden, during a rare address from the Oval Office on Thursday, warned Iran and its allies to not join the war and has said he will seek an extra $14 billion in military aid for Israel from Congress.

Iran and its allies have sharpened their language against Israel and the United States in the past two weeks, threatening to open new fronts in the war if the United States becomes more involved. Last week, a U.S. Navy warship in the northern Red Sea shot down three cruise missiles and several drones launched from Yemen that the Pentagon said might have been headed toward Israel. The United States said that the projectiles are a sign of growing attacks by Iranian-backed forces in the region, including Houthi rebels in Yemen, highlighting the risk of a broader war in the region."
436,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/opinion/international-world/israel-hamas-attack.html,"Saturday will be remembered as one of the most devastating days in Israel’s history.

The events were all too reminiscent of the attacks 50 years ago last week, on the morning of Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year. That day, in October 1973, Israel was attacked by a coordinated Arab coalition triggering a brutal, three-week war. The country survived only because of the huge sacrifice of its young men and women. It traumatized an entire generation of Israelis and changed the nation profoundly.

Saturday was our 1973.

The videos circulating of Israelis — women, children, older people — taken hostage, defenseless, will haunt us for the rest of our lives. The images are anathema not only to the basic Israeli ethos of self-defense but also to the country’s raison d’être as a safe haven for Jews. It shakes us to the core, but we do not have the luxury to dwell in the shock. We don’t have the time to digest the horrors. The Israel Defense Forces need to find the strength to regroup immediately and, once it has contained the situation within Israel’s borders, recalibrate and retaliate in a way that holds Hamas and its allies accountable and has a strategic logic, too. Our political leadership as well must re-examine the path it has charted and significantly change course.

These tragic events have one protagonist: Hamas. But there are two major Israeli blind spots that prevented us from recognizing and forestalling what we should have seen. The first is a policy of trying to appease the enemy, in the hopes that Hamas would eventually grow out of its jihadist origin. Instead, it was Hamas’s military wing that grew — from a small organization to a powerful army. Our second blind spot was letting our internal political differences consume us, distracting us from external threats and dividing both our society and, critically, the army.

In four years, Israel dedicated three military operations in Gaza to fighting Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a small Iranian proxy organization. Hamas, the ruling party of Gaza, which operates an army with tens of thousands of missiles and elite commando units, had been largely left to its own devices since the Guardian of the Walls operation in 2021. We paid the price of war — as did civilians in Gaza — for zero strategic gain. Why? Because Palestinian Islamic Jihad was the easier target. Israel wanted to avoid a big war in Gaza, and we got a slaughter in Israel."
437,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/opinion/hamas-israel-jews-massacre.html,"There is a reason so many Jews cannot stop shaking right now. The concept of intergenerational trauma doesn’t begin to describe the dark place into which this month’s attack plunged Jewish communities around the world.

On Oct. 7, a Jewish holiday, Hamas terrorists went house to house in southern Israel murdering and abducting children and grandparents, pulling them from their beds, displaying victims’ dead bodies online, in a massacre of at least 1,400 people. In at least one instance, terrorists were reported to have uploaded a video of the murder of one victim to her own social media account for her family to discover.

The feeling of deep dread that these atrocities stirred in Jews was horribly familiar. This is what Jewish history has all too often looked like: not civilians tragically killed in war but civilians publicly targeted, tortured and murdered, with the crimes put on public display. Accounts of past crowd-pleasing killings are folded into Jewish tradition; every Yom Kippur, we recount the public torture and execution of rabbis by their Roman oppressors in a packed second-century stadium. Those ancient stories are consistent with the experiences of the more immediate ancestors of nearly every Jew alive today.

I’m not even talking about the Holocaust, which several of last week’s oldest escapees and victims also endured. (Far more Jews were killed on Oct. 7 than on Kristallnacht.) No, I’m thinking of the Farhud pogrom in 1941 Baghdad, a two-day rampage in which hundreds of Jews were raped, tortured and murdered. I’m thinking of the pogroms of 1918 to 1921 in Ukraine, in which an estimated 100,000 Jews were slaughtered in organized massacres reminiscent of this month’s attack.

I’m thinking of the lynching of Leo Frank in Georgia in 1915, after which the delighted crowd’s snapshots of Frank’s body were made into postcards mailed around the country and pieces of his clothing were sold as souvenirs. I’m thinking of how many of the earliest books off Europe’s first printing presses were about the executions of Jews accused of blood libel and of a 11th-century massacre of thousands of Jews in Islamic Spain encouraged by a poem calling for Jewish blood and of the paintings and illuminated manuscripts showing Jews who were burned alive by the Spanish Inquisition and during the Black Death — all crowd-pleasing events celebrated in popular media and art.

Even ancient Romans celebrated their destruction of Judea by issuing commemorative coins featuring a bound Jewish woman and inscribed with the words “Judaea capta.” The humiliation and murder of Jews have always made a great meme.

Many American Jews, like Jews around the world, are descendants of those who survived. Our ancestors, in one way or another, were the ones who either made lucky decisions or barely made it out alive from Lodz and Kyiv and Aleppo and Tehran.

For diaspora Jews, the recent attacks were not distant overseas events. As was true in ancient times, the ties between global Jewish communities and Israel are concrete, specific, intimate and personal. My New Jersey Jewish Federation has institutional ties with the southern Israeli town of Ofakim and its surrounding communities, sharing annual home stays with a place whose death toll from the attacks already exceeds that of the notorious Kishinev pogrom of 1903, in which 49 Jews were murdered. Millions of American Jews, not to mention Jews in Britain, France, Australia and elsewhere, have friends and relatives in Israel. Even if Hamas hadn’t made it clear that it sees all Jews as targets, our connection is personal and all too real.

We spent days desperately scrolling to learn who among our acquaintances was dead, maimed or captive, connecting American hostages’ families with State Department contacts, attending panic-stricken online briefings and pooling resources and supplies for victims — all while fighting obtuse official statements from our own towns, schools, companies and universities that refused to mention the words “Israel” or “Jews” in referring to the largest single-day massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, lest some antisemite take offense at the existence of either.

We have tried to get our children off social media, shielding them from images of the violence. We’ve held mass fasts, recited psalms and sung ancient prayers for the rescue of captives. And as we gather by the thousands despite our many contradictory opinions and despite the extra security required for our gatherings even here, we have returned to the words of our ancestors that have carried us through thousands of years: Be strong and courageous. Choose life.

Many of us were physically carrying those words during the weekend of the attack, celebrating Simhat Torah, a joyous holiday when congregations dance with Torah scrolls, read the Torah’s final words and then scroll back to the beginning to start the book again.

As a child, I found this baffling. Why read the same story over and over, when we already know what happens? As an adult, I know that while the story doesn’t change, we do. What defines Jewish life is not history’s litany of horror but the Jewish people’s creative resilience in the face of it. In the wake of many catastrophes over millenniums, we have wrestled with God and one another, reinvented our traditions, revived our language, rebuilt our communities and found new meanings in our old stories of freedom and responsibility, each story animated by the improbable and unwavering belief that people can change.

Right now many of us feel trapped in this old, old story, doom-scrolling through images with terrible outcomes. But in our grief, I remind myself that each year as we finish the reading of the Torah, we immediately, at that very moment — and at the moment of this newest, oldest horror — scroll back to the story of creation and the invention of universal human dignity. We recall, once again, that every human is made in the divine image.

The story continues; we begin again."
438,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/us/politics/trump-israel-travel-ban.html,"Former President Donald J. Trump, while addressing the fighting in Israel on Monday, attempted to stoke fear of attacks taking place on U.S. soil and suggested that a travel ban like the one he implemented as president could stop such violence.

Mr. Trump’s comments, at a campaign rally in Wolfeboro, N.H., echoed the anti-Muslim rhetoric that he successfully tapped during his 2016 presidential run, harnessing sentiments that have lingered in the post-9/11 era.

While discussing a series of surprise attacks launched over the weekend by Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls the Gaza Strip, Mr. Trump promised to “stand strongly with the state of Israel” and said, to cheers, said that he had “imposed a strict travel ban to keep radical Islamic terrorists” out of the United States.

He called to “reimpose the travel ban on terror-afflicted countries.”

“The bloodshed and killing that we saw this week will never, ever be allowed to happen on American soil,” he said. “Except for the fact that we have now allowed tens of thousands of probable terrorists into our country.”"
439,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/world/middleeast/humanitarian-aid-gaza-israel-cairo.html,"Saturday marked two weeks since the Hamas rampage that killed more than 1,400 Israelis and triggered Israel’s declaration of war. Two of the more than 200 hostages believed to have been seized by Hamas during the terror attack, Judith Raanan and her teenage daughter, Natalie, were released Friday. Negotiations are continuing among several countries and Hamas representatives in Qatar about the other hostages, but there is no indication of when they might be released or how they are faring in captivity.

The exact number of hostages and their fates remain uncertain. “The majority of the hostages are alive,” the Israeli military said Friday in a statement that provided cold comfort to the families. The military said that more than 20 of the hostages are under 18 and at least 10 are over 60.

With tanks, armored personnel carriers and militarized bulldozers massed near the northern Gaza border in preparation for what Israel has said will be a ground invasion to wipe out the top leadership of Hamas, residents of the enclave waited anxiously on Saturday for full-scale war. The Israeli military has outlined plans of an invasion of Gaza that would include tens of thousands of soldiers ordered to capture Gaza City, in the northern part of the territory.

Israel’s military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Saturday that the country planned to step up its airstrikes as preparation for the next stage of the war, presumably referring to a ground invasion.

“We will deepen our attacks to minimize the dangers to our forces in the next stages of the war,” Hagari said, according to The Associated Press.

Gaza’s Health Ministry said Saturday that the death toll from hundreds of Israeli airstrikes over the past two weeks is at least 4,385 people, many of them women and children.

Fears persisted over the weekend that the war in Gaza could spread to a second front or more.

Israel and armed groups in Lebanon continued to exchange fire on Saturday. The Israeli military said militants had launched missiles and rockets at Israel and that its forces had responded by striking targets in Lebanon, including some affiliated with the politically powerful Hezbollah.

The Israeli authorities have ordered an evacuation of at least 29 communities close to the Lebanese border, including the city of Kiryat Shmona. As of Saturday, about 10,000 of its 23,000 residents remained, according to Yoram Maman, a city council member. Authorities hoped to begin wrapping up the operation by Sunday, he said.

Middle East Airlines, Lebanon’s national airline, has begun to cancel and reschedule some flights in and out of Beirut as tensions rise with Israel. On Friday, the carrier said that more than half of its airplanes would not be operating in the coming week. Foreign embassies in Lebanon have in recent days urged their citizens to leave that country while commercial flights remain available.

Leaders, foreign ministers and diplomats from dozens of Arab, European, African and other countries gathered in Cairo on Saturday for a “peace summit” aimed at de-escalating the violence in Gaza. But after hours of speeches, they had little to show for the trip other than a gaping divide, as Arab leaders castigated Western countries for not speaking out about the deaths of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

“The message the Arab world is hearing is loud and clear,” King Abdullah II of Jordan said in his remarks. “Palestinian lives matter less than Israeli ones. Our lives matter less than other lives. The application of international law is optional, and human rights have boundaries — they stop at borders, they stop at races and they stop at religions.”"
440,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/world/middleeast/us-hostages-release-israel-hamas-qatar-raanan.html,"An armed hostage rescue is considered too risky and dangerous at this moment, experts say, leaving officials from the constellation of countries feverishly continuing their negotiations.

Some Hamas political leaders are trying to distance themselves from the worst atrocities carried out by Hamas gunmen on Oct. 7 and now contend that it was angry Gazans and members of other armed groups — not their own fighters — who kidnapped the civilians. Yet videos released by Hamas fighters themselves depict the brutal killing of unarmed civilians.

Shocked by the scale of the attacks, Israel has refused to negotiate with Hamas, several officials said.

Instead, the Israeli army is amassing tanks and armored personnel carriers on Gaza’s border, primed for a full-scale invasion. And even though Israel allowed a trickle of humanitarian aid — 20 trucks for two million people — into Gaza on Saturday, Israeli warplanes show no sign of relenting in a campaign that is intended to destroy Hamas but has also killed thousands of civilians.

Yaakov Peri, a former head of the Shin Bet, the Israeli security service, said Israel may have agreed to let humanitarian aid enter Gaza on Saturday morning in light of the hostages’ release Friday night. He said Hamas’s motive might have been to inspire Israelis who have loved ones in captivity in Gaza to pressure their government to delay the impending ground invasion until more hostages are released.

“This is what Hamas is thinking,” Mr. Peri said. “But we cannot fall for this trap.”

There are still many questions of why, of all the 200 or so hostages, the Raanans were released. Robert D’Amico, a former F.B.I. agent who worked on hostage cases overseas, said it may have been the fact that the two were healthy.

“I don’t know if you want to release critically wounded ones,” he said. “It just looks bad.”

(Several hostages were badly injured before they were captured, including one California native who had half of his arm blown off by a grenade.)

Another obvious reason the Raanans were chosen, Mr. D’Amico and others said, is that they are Americans — though there are up to 10 more Americans in captivity. Hamas might be trying to temper Israeli retaliation on Gaza by gaining some good will from the Biden administration. President Biden and his team have been closely advising Israel on how it is waging its war on Gaza, although it is not clear how much Israel actually listens to what the Americans say."
441,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-attack.html,"The thousands of young Israelis had spent the night dancing at an outdoor rave, many clad in tie-dye T-shirts and crop tops.

They ended the night in a massacre.

Just after dawn on Saturday, hundreds of Palestinian militants bulldozed their way through the barricades between Gaza and Israel, drove into scores of Israeli towns along the border and sped through the farmland where the rave was reaching its sunrise climax.

The militants gunned down more than 100 ravers and abducted others, according to two senior Israeli officials, as they sprinted through the open fields. Video verified by The New York Times showed militants driving off on a motorcycle with an Israeli woman squeezed between them, screaming as her boyfriend was marched off on foot, his arm wrenched behind his back.

Those who survived often did so by hiding in nearby bushes, some of them for hours.

Bullets whistled overhead and shots resounded all around, said Andrey Peairie, 35, one of the survivors. He described crawling up to the top of a nearby hill to get a better sense of what was happening."
442,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/world/middleeast/us-citizens-killed-israel-hamas-captive.html,"At least 11 U.S. citizens have been killed in Israel and an unknown number are still unaccounted for, President Biden said in a statement on Monday evening, saying that “we believe it is likely that American citizens may be among those being held by Hamas.”

“I have directed my team to work with their Israeli counterparts on every aspect of the hostage crisis, including sharing intelligence and deploying experts from across the United States government to consult with and advise Israeli counterparts on hostage recovery efforts,” Mr. Biden said, while expressing anguish over the suffering of Israelis from “inexcusable hatred and violence.”

“This is not some distant tragedy,” Mr. Biden said in the statement. “The ties between Israel and the United States run deep. It is personal for so many American families who are feeling the pain of this attack as well as the scars inflicted through millennia of antisemitism and persecution of Jewish people.”

He noted that police departments across the United States had “stepped up security around centers of Jewish life, and the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other federal law enforcement partners are closely monitoring for any domestic threats” in connection with the attacks in Israel.

A number of Americans who had been visiting Israel during the attack, including two lawmakers — Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Representative Dan Goldman of New York — were able to leave the country over the weekend. Mr. Biden directed Americans trying to leave Israel to seek out remaining “commercial flights and ground options” and urged all American citizens in Israel to “please also take sensible precautions in the days ahead and follow the guidance of local authorities.”

Mr. Biden spoke with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a call on Sunday, in which they discussed the hostages taken by Hamas, as well as what military assistance the United States could provide. The Pentagon announced the same day that it was sending additional munitions to Israel and moving more Navy warships, including an aircraft carrier, and combat aircraft closer to Israel in a show of support. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said the United States was working to fulfill several specific requests from Israel for military assistance, without providing details.

On Monday, Defense Department officials said the Pentagon had offered the assistance of U.S. Special Operations forces for planning and surveillance in any hostage recovery efforts. A White House spokesman also clarified that the U.S. government was not sure that American were being held. “We can’t confirm that they are, in fact, holding hostages,” John F. Kirby, the spokesman, told reporters. There are, he said, Americans who are unaccounted for and may be captive.

In the statement on Monday, Mr. Biden evoked the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, lamenting the deaths of more Americans in an extremist attack.

“We remember the pain of being attacked by terrorists at home, and Americans across the country stand united against these evil acts that have once more claimed innocent American lives,” Mr. Biden said. “It is an outrage.”

The White House will be lit up in the blue and white colors of the Israeli flag on Monday night to express solidarity with Israel. It will be the latest landmark around the world to be so illuminated, joining the Empire State Building in New York, the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin and the Sydney Opera House in Australia, among others.

443,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/world/middleeast/peace-summit-gaza-egypt.html,"Leaders, foreign ministers and diplomats from dozens of Arab, European, African and other countries gathered in Cairo on Saturday for a “peace summit” aimed at de-escalating the violence in Gaza.

The application of international law is optional, and human rights have boundaries — they stop at borders, they stop at races and they stop at religions.”

One goal of any summit is to end in a joint statement that all the countries in attendance can agree on. But European leaders arrived in Cairo knowing they could not sign Egypt’s draft declaration, which did not mention Israel’s right to defend itself against Hamas, according to European diplomats and officials involved in the summit preparations.

“Like any other country in the world, Israel has the right to defend itself and to defend its people against this terror,” the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said in a speech at the summit, though she added that the defense must be “within the framework of international law.”

In the end, there was no statement.

Still, the remarks of several European leaders made clear that the soaring civilian death toll and looming humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza had forced a subtle shift in rhetoric. While reiterating Israel’s right to defend itself, the European leaders on Saturday uniformly called on Israel to act according to international law and urged greater protections for Palestinian civilians, points that had received less emphasis in the first few days after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks on Israeli civilians.

And despite the lack of a summit declaration, European officials said leaders from Greece, Cyprus, Italy and Spain, as well as the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, were eager to show up in Cairo, if only to demonstrate to their Arab partners that they were concerned about civilians in Gaza.

In much of the Muslim world, the Western response has sparked criticism of hypocrisy and double standards for its failure to condemn the siege and Israel’s airstrikes on civilians in Gaza — which critics said was the same sort of violence Western countries readily described as a “war crime” when Russia invaded Ukraine.

Outrage over those perceived double standards was on display at the Cairo summit, where leader after leader of Arab countries mourned the thousands of Palestinian civilians who have died in Israeli airstrikes since Oct. 7.

“Anywhere else, attacking civilian infrastructure and deliberately starving an entire population of food, water and basic necessities would be condemned,” King Abdullah said. “Accountability would be enforced.”

The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who is the most visible leader speaking for the European Union, added fuel to those charges with several missteps on her watch, including the unilateral announcement by one of her commissioners, later withdrawn, that the bloc would suspend aid to Gaza after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks. She did not attend the summit in Cairo, sending one of her deputies instead.

In more recent days, as the humanitarian situation within Gaza has worsened and the civilian death toll grown, it has become clear that European leaders want to send a different signal — though one that is still likely to sound too muted to Arab ears.

“Collective punishment is prohibited by the laws of war,” said Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Greece’s prime minister, in an apparent admonishment of Israel. “When war must be conducted, there are limits to what can be done to human beings. A total siege is against international law.”

Every Western official at the summit mentioned the need to ensure a steady flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza, and several countries announced at the summit that they would increase their funding for such aid. Ms. von der Leyen has also announced a tripling of aid to the Palestinians. (The bloc is the largest donor of aid to the Palestinians.)

And while the rest of the world might see a European Union fully aligned with Israel, within the bloc, complaints about Ms. von der Leyen’s staunchly pro-Israel posture have grown, even triggering a rare letter of complaint by European Commission staff members, who are usually both avowedly neutral and afraid for their career prospects in the E.U. executive branch.

The letter, which was addressed to Ms. von der Leyen personally, signed by some 850 staffers and first reported by Euractiv, accused her of a “patent show of double-standards” and said the Commission had given a “free hand to the acceleration and legitimacy of a war crime in the Gaza Strip.”"

445,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/world/middleeast/hostages-israel-hamas-gaza.html,"Israeli officials said that Hamas had taken at least 20 children, including toddlers; more than a dozen people in their 60s, 70s and 80s; and people who suffer from Parkinson’s disease, heart problems, diabetes and cancer. On top of that, several hostages were gravely wounded by gunshots and grenades during the terrorist attack.

Family members and international organizations are beseeching Hamas to show mercy and release the old, the young, the sick and the wounded first.

The International Committee of the Red Cross is one of the groups trying to help. Within two days of the attack, Red Cross officials said, they had approached Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar.

“The starting point — and I have a hard time getting away from this — is that there are people who should never be there,” said Fabrizio Carboni, the organization’s regional director for the Near and Middle East, in an interview this past week.

In the past 10 days, he said, the Red Cross has met face to face and held numerous telephone calls with Hamas officials, but, “considering the level of violence in Gaza, I see it as extremely complicated for us to do our work.”

Red Cross officials said they were asking Hamas leaders to offer “proof of life,” such as a message, phone call or video that would prove each person believed to be held captive is alive. The Red Cross is also asking Hamas to allow in medicine and to immediately release the hostages with urgent health needs, like Rut.

“They should all be released, but the ones with specific medical conditions should be even more released than the others,” Mr. Carboni said. “There is no way easily to provide the medical help they need in Gaza today,” he added. “We asked for it. But today we are far from it, very far.”"
446,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/us/jewish-muslim-communities-israel-hamas-war.html,"The two women sat knee to knee.

Aziza Hasan, a devout Muslim, looked out at the group gathered around her, spoke of the loved ones who had died in Israel and Gaza and began reciting the first chapter of the Quran.

“In the name of God, the most compassionate, most merciful …”

“Show us the straight way,” she continued, “the way of those whose portion is not wrath and who go not astray.”

Then, the woman beside her, Andrea Hodos, a devout Jew, followed with a Hebrew song acknowledging the angels.

“On my right side is Gabriel, God’s strength,” she told the crowd, translating the song. “Behind me, God’s healer, Raphael. Above my head is God’s divine presence.”

On this late afternoon of Oct. 15, the war between Israel and Hamas was well underway as Ms. Hasan and Ms. Hodos sat on parched grass at a bustling park six miles west of downtown Los Angeles. A circle of Jews and Muslims surrounded them.

Everyone on hand was part of NewGround, a nonprofit fellowship program that has helped more than 500 Los Angeles Muslims and Jews learn to listen, disagree, empathize with one another — and become friends.

Ms. Hasan, whose family roots run through Palestine, runs NewGround. Ms. Hodos, once a resident of Israel, has been her associate director since 2020.

The two women can recall details of the long, brutal history of clashes and wars pitting Israel against its neighbors to the north, east and south — and how those clashes sent fearful shock waves through Los Angeles, a city with one of the nation’s largest populations of Muslims and Jews.

“But it’s never been this bad,” they said, practically in unison, during a recent interview at a Los Angeles cafe.

Never have they worried like this about death and destruction in the Middle East sparking antisemitic or Islamophobic violence in the United States.

Never have they fretted like this about their work and their words being misinterpreted and misunderstood.

Never had they held this much dread, or found this kind of hopeful, grounding solace in the interfaith bonds their labor has created."

My name is Elizabeth Spiers, and I am a contributing writer to the New York Times Opinion section. I’m also a digital strategist.

So when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, like everyone else, I was aware that it was happening, but I also was trying to stay off of social media a bit at the time because I had been sick and I was trying to preserve my own health and mental health too.

But I was following what was happening. And I was hesitant to say anything until I understand better what the actual facts on the ground were, and also had thought through what my own opinions about the situation were. I’m not Palestinian or Jewish. I’m not a foreign policy expert. When I write for “The Times,” I tend to cover domestic politics, culture war issues, and the internet. So I was a little baffled to open up X and find people tweeting at me wanting to know why I hadn’t made a statement, and suggesting that my failure to tweet was somehow complicity.

I think the pressure to say something publicly really comes from the fear we face when we’re confronted with horrors like this. What we want is a simple binary where there’s a good side and an evil side and we can easily identify heroes and villains. And social media kind of lends itself to making very binary statements. It’s really hard to do nuanced analysis in a format that really only allows for 280 characters at a time.

It’s much easier to say “I’m on the side of good” or “I’m on the side of evil” and “here’s who the villain is” and “here’s who the hero is.” But I don’t think that really adds anything to any serious discussion about what’s going on. It’s a way to make people feel better about saying something or taking a stand, even if it’s not very well thought out or it’s overly simplistic.

But it doesn’t help us as a society to wrestle with these things that are so complex and are not really easily soluble problems. The conflict in Gaza has been going on for decades. The idea that we can come in and find a solution on social media in a matter of, days or that someone’s going to articulate a perfectly formed opinion or formed position that everyone universally consensually will line up behind is just nonsense.

I think there has to be room for people to say things that are more nuanced, to have some uncertainty about what’s happening and about what they think. And right now, social media doesn’t really lend itself to that. I’m not discounting the ability of social media to play a role in mass movements. We’ve seen it happen.

We saw it with the Arab Spring. People right now are using social media tools to get information out to the rest of the world. But I do think you have to differentiate between a reactive slogan that somebody posts on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook and a journalist using these tools on the ground to report what’s happening. These are not the same things.

I think it’s obvious to most people that experts and people who are directly affected by the situation have a right to speak, and that they add to the conversation, and that we need to make room for them. What I don’t like is the idea that if people don’t post, that they’re doing something immoral, because the dialogue around what’s happening does not exist solely or even primarily on social media. I think what bothers me, too, is holding up social media as a primary vector for action, when it’s simply not.

Personally, one thing that I’ve always struggled with but I try to get better at on a Daily basis is, really, sitting with discomfort — whether it’s emotional discomfort, or just information that is disturbing to me, or that’s just hard to take in. And I think that’s difficult for everyone, but I think the internet makes it doubly hard, because we’re not used to sitting quietly in general.

We get used to constantly being stimulated. So in that context, I’m very sympathetic to people who find it difficult to not react immediately. I find it difficult many times. But I do think that it’s a practice that we need to develop or we lose a lot of what’s important in terms of actually thinking through these issues that are way more complex than anything that you can digest in a tweet or two."
448,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/us/politics/desantis-israel-hamas-visas.html,"In a competition of hawkish messages on Israel, Ron DeSantis pledged on Friday night to revoke the student visas of Hamas sympathizers if elected president, while Tim Scott said he would withhold Pell grants from universities that failed to stamp out antisemitism.

At an Iowa showcase featuring most of the top Republican presidential contenders, the Florida governor and the South Carolina senator engaged in one-upmanship about who would best support Israel, America’s closest Middle East ally.

With their focus on students and academic institutions, they repackaged a traditional line of attack for Republicans: that liberal college campuses foster “woke” extremism, which they said was now taking the form of anti-Israel expressions.

“You see students demonstrating in our country in favor of Hamas,” Mr. DeSantis said. “Remember, some of them are foreigners.”

Mr. DeSantis then warned that if he became president, “I’m canceling your visa and I’m sending you home.”

His remarks, during a tailgate at a construction plant in Iowa City, echoed recent talking points of former President Donald J. Trump, the G.O.P. front-runner, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who sent a letter to Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken this week urging him to rescind the visas of “Hamas sympathizers.”

Mr. Trump, who did not attend the event, had issued a similar pledge to expel student sympathizers of Hamas."
449,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/opinion/china-taiwan-war.html,"Broadly speaking, Biden is correct; the United States has a strong interest in preventing rival powers from redrawing maps or undermining America’s democratic allies. But the difference between the president’s strategic analysis and the kind I’ve tried to offer recently is twofold: the general absence, in Biden’s words, of any acknowledgment of difficult trade-offs and the specific absence of any reference to China as a potentially more significant threat than Russia or Iran.

These absences are not particularly surprising. It’s normal for American presidents to say chest-pounding things like “There is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity” rather than to talk about possible limits on our strength. And since we don’t actually want to be at war with China, it makes a certain sense to avoid lumping Beijing in with Moscow and Tehran.

But presidential rhetoric and policy are inevitably linked, and the China threat that doesn’t exist in Biden’s speech barely exists in his funding request: The administration is asking Congress for over $60 billion for Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel and just $2 billion for the Indo-Pacific. Likewise, a president’s rhetoric lacunas inform political priorities, at least within his own coalition. If you can’t talk about why we need to worry about Chinese power alongside Russian or Iranian aggression, the people who listen to you may assume there’s nothing to worry about.

So let me explain why I worry about China and why I keep insisting that a strategy of containment in the Pacific should be a priority, even when other threats seem more immediate.

Start with the geopolitical background. It makes sense to talk about China, Iran and Russia as a loose alliance trying to undermine American power, but it is not a trio of equals. Only China is an arguable peer of the United States, only China’s technological and industrial might can hope to match our own, and only China has the capacity to project power globally as well as regionally.

Moreover, China offers a somewhat coherent ideological alternative to the liberal-democratic order. The Putin regime is a parody of Western democracy, and Iran’s mixture of theocracy and pseudodemocracy holds little broad appeal. But China’s one-party meritocracy can advertise itself — maybe less effectively since Xi Jinping’s consolidation of power but still with some degree of plausibility — as a successor to democratic capitalism, an alternative model for the developing world.

These general strategic realities obviously aren’t as threatening as actual aggression. But the threat China poses to Taiwan, in particular, has different implications for American power from the threat Russia poses to Ukraine or Hamas poses to Israel. Whatever happens in the Ukrainian conflict, America was never formally committed to Ukraine’s defense, and Russia cannot realistically defeat NATO. Whatever misery Iran and its proxies may inflict upon the Middle East, they are not going to conquer Israel or drive American power out of the Levant.

But America is more committed (with whatever public ambiguity) to the defense of Taiwan, and that expectation has always been in the background of our larger alliance system in East Asia. And while six experts may give six different opinions, there are good reasons to think that China is open to invading Taiwan in the near future and that America could join such a war and lose outright.

China hawks tend to argue that losing a war over Taiwan would be much worse than our post-9/11 debacles, worse than letting Vladimir Putin hold the Donbas and Crimea permanently. You cannot definitively prove this, but I think they’re right: The establishment of Chinese military pre-eminence in East Asia would be a unique geopolitical shock, with dire effects on the viability of America’s alliance systems, on the likelihood of regional wars and arms races and on our ability to maintain the global trading system that undergirds our prosperity at home.

And it’s at home where I fear the effects of such a defeat the most. America has experience losing wars of empire — in Vietnam and Afghanistan, for example, where we were extending ourselves without putting our full might into the fray. But we have no experience being defeated in straightforward combat, not guerrilla war, by a great-power rival and ideological competitor.

Whatever anxieties you have about our current political divisions, whether you fear left-wing disillusionment with America or right-wing disillusionment with democracy or both, such a defeat seems more likely than anything to accelerate us toward a real internal crisis. Which is why, even with other foreign crises burning hot, a debacle in East Asia remains the scenario that the United States should be working most intensely to avert.

450,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-humanitarian-aid.html,"Two days after President Biden said he had secured Israel’s agreement to allow food, water and medicine into the besieged Gaza Strip, and a day after aid groups were told their trucks would cross the border on Friday, nothing budged, as the powers involved continued to haggle over the details, while conditions within Gaza grew more dire.

Speaking on Friday at the frontier between Egypt and Gaza, the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, confirmed reports that Israel and Egypt had agreed a day earlier to make aid deliveries possible “with some conditions and some restrictions,” which were still being hammered out. For more than a week, there have been reports of a possible breakthrough, yet the trucks haven’t moved.

Most recently, Israel was objecting to several aspects of plans put forward by aid groups and the United Nations, according to several U.N. and European officials and diplomats familiar with talks that also involve Egypt and the United States.

Adding to the sense of desperation in Gaza, Israel is preparing for an expected ground invasion to crush Hamas, the group that controls the territory, which would make the humanitarian needs greater — and make them harder to meet. Amid a war between Israel and Hamas that has killed thousands, more than 2 million people are trapped in the territory, many of them displaced from their homes, with rapidly dwindling vital supplies.

“Behind these walls, we have 2 million people that is suffering enormously, that has no water, no food, no medicine, no fuel, that is under fire, that needs everything to survive. On this side, we have seen so many trucks loaded with water, with fuel, with medicines, with food,” Mr. Guterres said, gesturing behind him.

The trucks, he added, are “the difference between life and death for so many people in Gaza.”"
451,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/world/middleeast/hamas-hostages-released.html,"Hamas still holds 10 other Americans hostage, according to the State Department, and President Biden vowed on Friday to make every effort to reunite their families.

“We will not stop until we get their loved ones home,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. “I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans held hostage around the world.” He asked the public to respect the privacy of the Raanans “as they recover and heal.”

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a news conference on Friday that “every hostage needs to be released and needs to be released now,” unconditionally.

Mr. Blinken said he could not discuss details of the negotiations to free Judith and Natalie Raanan. According to someone familiar with the negotiations, Hamas asked for nothing in return for their release.

Hamas, Mr. Biden and Mr. Blinken all noted the role played by the government of Qatar, a wealthy Persian Gulf emirate that allows Hamas leaders to live there in safety, and has often acted as a go-between to resolve conflicts between the group and Israel. Mr. Blinken said Qatar had provided “very important assistance” in the hostage negotiations.

A spokesman for Qatar’s Foreign Ministry, Majid Al-Ansari, said in a statement that the release of the hostages came after days of continuous talks. He said Qatar would continue its mediation.

“We hope these efforts will lead to the release of all civilian hostages from every nationality, with the ultimate aim of de-escalating the current crisis and restoring peace,” he said.

In a statement, Hamas said it had decided to work toward “closing the file” of the hostage issue, “should the appropriate security circumstances be provided.”

Ms. Raanan and her daughter went to Israel last month to celebrate the Jewish holidays and the 85th birthday of Judith’s mother at a kibbutz in the south of the country.

Judith Raanan was born in Israel and spent her early life there before settling in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Ill., where she raised a family. Natalie Raanan, who also lived in Israel as a child, graduated from a public high school in Deerfield, Ill., near Chicago.

Chavah Rochel Golden, a friend of Judith’s in Chicago, said that Judith had never forgotten her Israeli roots and that it was important to her that her daughter feel the same way.

“She was quite Israeli, whether she was here or there,” Ms. Golden said. “She missed being around Israelis. She felt at home with Israelis, and she missed that — the energy of Israel.”

On Friday, Rivka Benyihoun, another friend from Chicago, said she and her husband had been watching Israeli television for news of their friend.

“We are all embracing and crying together,” Ms. Benyihoun said. “I told my husband, ‘She’s a survivor. She’s going to make it.’”

Avi Zamir, Natalie’s uncle, said the family was overwhelmed with relief but was awaiting news of the women’s condition.

After receiving word of their release, Mr. Zamir called his son, a student at Deerfield High School outside Chicago, to share the news, and heard a classroom of suburban teenagers erupt in cheers.

“I can’t even tell you the voices of joy I heard over the phone,” he said. “It’s a joyful moment for all Americans right now.”

In a statement, Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois said he was “incredibly relieved” that the Raanans were safe.

“I cannot wait to welcome them back home after demonstrating immense strength and bravery in the face of unthinkable terror,” Mr. Pritzker said.

The situation of the more than 200 other hostages remains unclear. Israel has not publicly identified them, but military officials have said they include older people and children. Hamas has said that Israel’s bombing campaign in retaliation for the Oct. 7 attack has killed a number of hostages, along with the Hamas militants holding them.

Most of the captives were taken from small Israeli towns near the border with Gaza; others were abducted from military bases or from an all-night music festival. They include civilians, soldiers, peace activists, grandparents and a 9-month-old baby.

It was not clear why the Raanans were released before others, how they were treated in captivity or what Hamas intends to do with the remaining hostages. In the days after the raid, a Hamas official said it would kill captives if Israel continued to bomb homes in Gaza, but later the group said it wanted to trade them for Hamas members who are imprisoned in Israel or elsewhere.

Hamas has also acknowledged that it does not have all the hostages; some are held by smaller groups that took part in the assault on Israel.

On Friday, Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, disputed Hamas’s claim that it had released the Raanans for humanitarian reasons. “This is actually a murderous terrorist organization that right now holds babies, children, women and elderly people hostage in the Gaza Strip,” he told reporters.

The issue of hostages has long been a deeply emotional one in Israel, as well as a tactic used in the past by Hamas and Hezbollah, the Shiite militant organization in Lebanon.

Hamas is believed to be holding two Israeli civilians who entered Gaza in 2014 on foot, as well as the remains of two Israeli soldiers killed during a war that year.

And in 2006, Hamas seized an Israel soldier, Gilad Shalit, and held him in Gaza for five years. He was exchanged for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, many of whom had been convicted of killing Israelis in terrorist attacks.

That same year, Israel fought a monthlong war with Hezbollah in Lebanon after it kidnapped two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid. The soldiers’ remains were returned to Israel in 2008 in exchange for five prisoners.

Shortly after the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas released video of a woman and two small children it said it had released at the Gaza border. But the woman, Avital Aladjem, told Israeli news media that she and the children had escaped shortly after crossing the border because their captors left them briefly alone. She said the children belonged to her neighbor, who was killed in the attack.

Earlier this week, Hamas released a short video of Mia Schem, 21, who was abducted during the Hamas assault on the music festival. In the video, she is shown with a bandaged arm and says that she has received medical treatment while in captivity. It is so far the only video the group has released of any of the hostages.

“At the moment I am in Gaza,” Ms. Schem says in the video, which was posted to Telegram channels affiliated with Hamas. “I just ask that I am returned as fast as possible to my family, to my parents, and to my siblings. Please get us out of here as quickly as possible.”

452,https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000009143319/hamas-american-hostages-release.html,"Two American citizens held by Hamas since Oct. 7 were released. These two Americans are now safely in the hands of Israeli authorities in Israel. We welcome their release. We share in the relief that their families, friends and loved ones are feeling. But there are still 10 additional Americans who remain unaccounted for in this conflict. We know that some of them are being held hostage by Hamas, along with an estimated 200 other hostages held in Gaza. They include men, women, young boys, young girls, elderly people, from many nations. Every single one of them should be released. The urgent work to free every single American, to free all other hostages continues, as does our work to secure the safe passage out of Gaza for the Americans who are trapped there."
453,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/world/middleeast/palestinian-protests-gaza-egypt-morocco.html,"As the Israeli bombardment of Gaza has intensified in recent days, large protests have erupted across the Arab and Muslim worlds in support of the Palestinian cause, a reminder of the profound resonance the issue still holds for many.

That popular outpouring has put new pressures on Arab leaders, many of whom have invested little effort in recent years to support the Palestinians or advance their political or economic interests.

Now, those leaders must navigate the pursuit of what they consider their own countries’ interests while indicating to their people that they, too, are supporting the Palestinian cause.

“The Israeli-Palestinian conflict was relegated to the background, partly because of apathy and partly because of a feeling of helplessness that was pervasive in the Arab world,” said Lina Khatib, the director of the SOAS Middle East Institute at the University of London.

The climate shifted noticeably after Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls Gaza, attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7 and killed roughly 1,400 people. That unleashed a barrage of Israeli airstrikes on the crowded and impoverished Gaza Strip that Gaza health authorities say have killed thousands. The violence has displaced about half of Gaza’s population of more than 2 million Palestinians, according to the United Nations.

“The tragic events have shown that it remains at the heart of Middle Eastern politics and a major concern for people across the region,” Ms. Khatib said of the Palestinian struggle.

For decades, support for the idea of an independent Palestinian state was a rare issue that Arabs in different countries and across political divides could easily agree on. But in recent years, the focus on the Palestinian issue had waned for many reasons. Infighting between Palestinian factions and the absence of peace talks with Israel for many years seemed to leave no path for progress."
454,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/arts/palestinian-events-cancelled-war.html,"Nathan Thrall had planned to visit several cities this fall promoting his new book, “A Day in the Life of Abed Salama,” a reported look at Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. But after Hamas launched its deadly attacks on Israeli civilians, days after the book’s release this month, readings in London, New York, Los Angeles and Washington were postponed or canceled.

They are among a growing number of events highlighting Palestinian culture, society and politics that have been called off or put on hold since the war began. A concert of young Palestinian musicians was indefinitely postponed in London. The Boston Palestine Film Festival decided not to hold live screenings and went online. And in one of the most high-profile cancellations, a German literary organization called off an awards ceremony at the Frankfurt Book Fair to honor the Palestinian novelist Adania Shibli.

Some organizers said they were calling off the Palestinian-themed events because of security concerns. Others cited sensitivity, calling the cancellations and postponements understandable, if unfortunate, responses at a moment when emotions are raw: The Hamas attack killed at least 1,400 Israelis in what President Biden called “the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust,” and since then Israeli strikes have killed more than 4,100 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

But some fear that the net effect will be to muzzle events, and voices, that might have promoted greater understanding at a key moment in the history of the region.

“It’s obviously a very sensitive issue,” said Aaron Terr, the director of public advocacy for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a free-speech watchdog. “That’s exactly when free speech is so valuable. We should want to maximize expression on such a fraught and controversial issue. We should try to work out our differences through dialogue and criticism.”

London’s Southwark Cathedral cited security concerns when it canceled an Oct. 11 concert celebrating the 10th anniversary of PalMusic UK, a charity based in London that supports young Palestinian musicians. The event was to have featured three young Palestinians on piano, oud, and ney, a wind instrument.

“We were clearly disappointed that there wasn’t an opportunity to have a concert that celebrated peace and was a ray of light for musicians in Palestine,” Sal Sherratt, PalMusic’s director, said in an interview. “However, we completely respect that safety is foremost, and frankly it was just days after the outbreak of war, with considerable tensions in London.”

A Hilton hotel in Houston canceled the annual conference of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights planned for later this month, citing “escalating security concerns in the current environment.” Ahmad Abuznaid, the group’s executive director, said that the group had also noticed a concerted effort online to block the event: “We saw on social media, folks posting racist rhetoric in their calls to the Hilton to cancel.”

Mr. Terr, of the free expression group, warned that the postponements and cancellations could have a chilling effect — even when done out of concern for safety.

“It enables the heckler’s veto,” he said, “where people are able to shut down speakers just by threatening to create a disturbance.”

When the Boston Palestine Film Festival canceled its live screenings this month, it said in a statement that it “strives to create space for our community to gather and that space is needed today more than ever.”

“However,” it continued, “we are committed to centering the safety of our audiences and to being sensitive to all members of our community who have been impacted.”

In Germany, the decision to cancel the awards ceremony at the Frankfurt Book Fair for Shibli set off controversy. She won the award for her novel “Minor Detail,” which begins in 1949 and includes an account of the gang rape and murder of a Bedouin girl by an Israeli Army unit. The cancellation of the ceremony was denounced in an open letter signed by hundreds of writers and editors — including the Nobel laureates Annie Ernaux, Abdulrazak Gurnah and Olga Tokarczuk — that said the book fair had a responsibility “to be creating spaces for Palestinian writers to share their thoughts, feelings, reflections on literature through these terrible, cruel times, not shutting them down.”

Thrall, the writer whose readings were postponed, is traveling from Jerusalem, where he is based, to several other cities to discuss his new book. He planned several events with his book’s primary subject, Abed Salama, a Palestinian man who went in search of his 5-year-old son, who was in a bus accident, all while navigating the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem as a Palestinian."
455,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/health/gaza-ukraine-hospitals-doctors.html,"Attacks on medical facilities jeopardize health care not only for those injured by fighting, but also for all those with routine medical needs. On Thursday, Doctors Without Borders (also known as M.S.F., an abbreviation for its French name, Médecins Sans Frontières) withdrew a surgical team from a hospital in Sudan after military authorities blocked all delivery of supplies to the facility. The team had been providing lifesaving trauma surgeries and cesarean sections from one of the last functioning hospitals in the capital, Khartoum.

“It’s so painful, because of the moral distress of the medics,” Mr. Hofman said. They were unable to function without basic supplies, but also profoundly disturbed to cut off one of the last sources of care in a city where fighting has not let up since rival factions of the military government went to war in April.

In Ukraine, Russian attacks have destroyed 10 to 15 percent of medical facilities. The damage is even more far-reaching than it might seem, said Pavlo Kovtoniuk, a former deputy minister of health in Ukraine who now works with a think tank called the Ukrainian Health Center.

“Hospitals symbolize respect for civilian life, and when people see that disregarded they say, ‘We have to get out,’” he said. “We have a huge loss of human capital, with more than six million people now living outside the borders.”

Among those who remain, there is a growing population in need of rehabilitation and psychosocial support, from a steadily shrinking health system.

“This is not a situation of waging war according to the laws of war and the Geneva Convention — this is a completely different philosophy of war where civilian lives are disregarded entirely,” Mr. Kovtoniuk said.

He added: “We are revisiting the rules we thought were a given on regard for civilian life, and Russia has contributed to this feeling, ‘OK, we can do this. We can attack civilian infrastructure as a weapon of war.’”

Ukrainian officials are working with the International Criminal Court to compile evidence from the attacks, Mr. Kovtoniuk said. At least some top Russian officials must be indicted in order to re-establish the principle of protecting health care workers and facilities, he said. Russia has often either said that the facilities it hit were harboring Ukrainian fighters or dismissed the accusations as fake.

In Sudan, M.S.F. says that fatalities caused by neglected medical needs are as great as those caused by violent injuries. According to the World Health Organization, 70 percent of Sudan’s medical facilities are no longer functioning. More than seven million people are now internally displaced and face a cascade of disease outbreaks."
456,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-israel.html,"Here are the most fraught sticking points, according to the officials and diplomats directly involved in or briefed on the talks. They spoke on condition of anonymity to share details of the evolving discussions.

Quantity and flow of aid

Israel would like for 20 trucks to pass into Gaza, but won’t commit on future aid flows. The international community wants the number to grow to 100 or more trucks a day.

“What is certainly undoubtedly needed is a steady flow of much bigger quantities of humanitarian assistance,” the European Union humanitarian aid commissioner, Janez Lenarcic, said in an interview on Friday. The E.U. is the biggest international aid donor to the Palestinians and has dozens of tons of aid on the Egyptian side of the border waiting to be delivered.

Destination of aid

Israel wants aid to be delivered to southern Gaza, not northern Gaza where it had demanded last week that civilians leave, in an apparent run-up to a ground invasion. But hundreds of thousands of people remain in northern Gaza, facing dire humanitarian needs.

“Humanitarian aid should go to all places where there are people who need it,” Mr. Lenarcic said.

Type of aid

Israel wants food, medicine and water to be distributed, but international donors are pushing to expand the list of permitted items to include fuel, among other items. Fuel is particularly contentious, as Israel worries it could get diverted to Hamas to be used for weapons or its vehicles.

The U.N. and other international donors say that fuel is essential — a matter of life or death, especially for Gaza’s hospitals that are relying on backup generators with Israel having cut off electricity in the territory. Fuel is also needed to restart desalination facilities for potable water, as Israel has also stopped Gaza’s water supply.

International observers

Israel wants some direct involvement in scrutinizing the cargo that enters Gaza, to ensure that trucks are not carrying weapons. The international community is pressing instead to give trained United Nations staff this task, replicating the model used for aid delivery in Syria.

The United Nations generally prefers that inspections be in the hands of neutral parties so that it cannot be politicized.

458,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-scene.html,"Israeli citizens, barricaded in their homes in towns near the Gaza Strip, called into television stations as Palestinian gunmen crossed the border into Israel and invaded their communities on Saturday morning. The Israelis spoke in whispers as they pleaded desperately for help.

One woman named Doreen told Israel’s Channel 12 that militants were in her house in Nahal Oz, a small rural community, and that she was hiding in a safe room. “My husband is holding the door of the bomb shelter,” she said. “Now they’re shooting sprays of bullets at the bomb shelter’s window. Sprays. And my three children are here with me.”

On the other side of the border in Gaza, Jamila Al-Zanin, 39, tried to distract her own three children as they fled their home and drove south.

“The children were terrified. As we drove down they were looking left and right, everywhere there were explosions and booms,” she said. “They were hysterical.”"
459,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/opinion/israel-war-gaza-hospital-danger.html,"I went to bed on Tuesday night assuming, as many people did, that an Israeli airstrike had killed at least 500 people in Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza. That’s what the Gaza Health Ministry claimed, and those claims made headlines in leading news outlets, including this one. Politicians issued impassioned condemnations of what some called Israeli war crimes. Social media lit up with anguished howls of grief and rage. Furious protests erupted throughout the Middle East. A historic synagogue in Tunisia was reportedly set alight, and a synagogue was attacked with a firebomb in Berlin. The leaders of Jordan and Egypt canceled a meeting with President Biden, where they would have discussed aid to Gaza.

Of course, I’d read Israel’s insistence that an errant Islamic Jihad rocket had caused the explosion at the hospital, but I didn’t put much stock in it, because in the past when Israel accidentally killed civilians, it has blamed Palestinians for the deaths. In May of last year, the Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot and killed while covering an Israeli raid on the Jenin refugee camp. Israeli officials said she was shot either by a Palestinian or by an Israeli soldier aiming at a Palestinian gunman. A New York Times investigation, however, contradicted the official Israeli line. It found that the bullet that killed Abu Akleh was fired from the direction of an Israeli military convoy and that “there were no armed Palestinians near her when she was shot.”

A few months later, during another round of Israeli bombing of Gaza, five Palestinian boys were killed in a cemetery. Initially, Israeli officials blamed a misfired Islamic Jihad rocket for the deaths. But as the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported, an army inquiry found they were actually killed by an Israeli airstrike. With the hospital explosion, it seemed history was repeating itself on a larger and more tragic scale.

Perhaps it was, just not in the way I thought. As I write this, it looks increasingly likely that Israel was correct about an Islamic Jihad rocket hitting Al-Ahli hospital. That, at least, is what both early American intelligence and a number of independent experts have found. If their analysis holds up, it means the best analogy for this world-convulsing event is not the killings of five boys in Gaza last year. It is the myth of a massacre at the Jenin refugee camp in 2002.

That year, a Hamas suicide bomber killed 30 people at a Passover Seder in the seaside city of Netanya, in what was, until this month, the deadliest single attack on Jewish Israelis since the country’s founding. As part of its response, Israel Defense Forces invaded the West Bank city of Jenin, leveling dozens of refugee camp buildings. Palestinian leaders claimed Israel had committed a massacre; the Palestinian official Saeb Erekat told CNN that at least 500 people had been killed. People all over the world believed these reports; as a BBC headline put it, “Jenin ‘massacre evidence growing.’”

But Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the United Nations later concluded that the reports of a massacre weren’t true. The real Palestinian death toll was less than 60 — still an awful number but significantly fewer than what was feared. Human Rights Watch soon revealed that its researchers had found “no evidence to sustain claims of massacres or large-scale extrajudicial executions by the I.D.F. in Jenin refugee camp,” even though many of the civilian deaths “amounted to unlawful or willful killings by the I.D.F.” This finding, that the Israeli military had committed only a small fraction of the extrajudicial killings it was accused of, was not an exoneration. But it should have been a cautionary tale about accepting incendiary claims of Israeli atrocities at face value.

The rush to judgment on Tuesday night will continue to haunt us all. Not long after the allegations emerged of a massacre in Jenin, The Guardian said, “Jenin already has that aura of infamy that attaches to a crime of especial notoriety,” predicting that it would “live on in memory and myth.” The Guardian was wrong about the scale of death in Jenin but right about the afterlife of the rumors. The narrative that Israel perpetrated a massacre at Al-Ahli will soon take on the same aura of infamy, with the amateur forensics of the internet only making it worse.

In much of the world, there will be no dissuading people from holding Israel and, by extension, America liable for the hospital bombing. At the same time, Israel will be able to use this episode to deflect criticism of the violence it really is inflicting on the Palestinians. Jews, whatever their views about Zionism, will be placed in greater danger. As this hideous war grinds on, there will almost certainly be other enormities. We will only compound the horrors if we pretend to be instantly certain about them."
460,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/briefing/gaza-hospital.html,"The explosion at a hospital in Gaza on Tuesday evening — the source of which remains unclear — hasn’t been the only international mystery in recent weeks. Last month, Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, suggested that Indian government agents had helped murder a Canadian citizen near Vancouver in a political attack.

The course that story took offers some insights into how the world might get some clarity about the Gaza explosion. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain — and update you on the latest news from Israel and Gaza.

Canada’s failure

On Sept. 18, Trudeau delivered a speech from the floor of the Canadian Parliament in which he talked about “credible allegations of a potential link” between India’s government and the shooting of a Sikh nationalist. Trudeau cited Canadian intelligence agencies.

But he offered no evidence that outsiders could evaluate on their own — no photographs, no video, no financial transactions, no narrative of the events leading up to the shooting.

Indian government officials strongly denied the allegation, and almost everybody else was left uncertain about what had happened. Other governments — including Canadian allies like the U.S. — did not publicly support Canada or criticize India. “They’re not coming out as unequivocally as Canada would have hoped,” as my colleague Mujib Mashal, who covers South Asia, said.

The aftermath of the Gaza explosion has been different in some important ways. Intelligence agencies released information much more quickly than usual, hoping to avoid what you might call the Trudeau problem. But they have not avoided it — because they did not release the kind of information, like satellite images or videos, likely to clear up confusion and sway undecided people who are open to empirical evidence.

There are reasons that officials are hesitant to do so. Releasing information can expose its source, like a spy or a hidden surveillance camera. Yet the stakes seem high enough that the side that’s telling the truth could gain a huge diplomatic advantage through transparency.

The basics

After the explosion happened, Palestinian officials quickly said that an Israeli airstrike was the cause. Some media organizations — including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press, CNN and BBC — prominently reported the claim without caveats.

But Israeli officials soon told a very different story. The explosion was the result of a malfunctioned rocket — intended for Israel — launched by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a group tied to Hamas, the Israelis said. U.S. officials have since said that their own intelligence supports the Israeli version of events.

Below are the arguments that each side has made so far.

The Palestinian case

Gaza officials and their supporters have three main arguments, all circumstantial.

The first claim is that Israel previously targeted the same hospital. It was hit by rocket fire last week, independent observers agree (although the source remains unclear), and hospital managers said they had later received texts and calls urging them to evacuate. Palestinian officials say the warnings were specific to the hospital compound; Israeli officials say they were general warnings for northern Gaza.

The second argument is that Israel has previously dissembled about civilian casualties. Last year, after Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist, was killed in the West Bank, Israeli officials said that a Palestinian gunman might have shot her. A later New York Times investigation suggested that the bullet had come from an elite Israeli military unit.

The third argument is that Israelis changed their story of the hospital bombing in the hours after it. For example, Israel’s official government Twitter account posted a video on Tuesday purporting to show a Palestinian rocket barrage near the hospital. In truth, the video’s time stamp was too late to be showing the source of the hospital explosion, and Israel removed the video from the tweet.

The Israeli case

Israel and its supporters have pointed out that Hamas and its allies have their own history of dissembling about violence, including about rockets that killed Palestinians last year, as The Associated Press has explained.

But the Israeli case also includes more current and detailed arguments than the Palestinian case does.

First, U.S. officials say that infrared data, including from satellites, shows the launch of a rocket or missile from Palestinian fighter positions within Gaza on Tuesday evening. Open-source video — recorded by journalists and others — also shows that the launch did not come from the direction of Israeli military positions, the officials say. (In an Oval Office address last night, President Biden said that the hospital attack “was not done by the Israelis.”)

Second, the Israeli military argues that its missiles cause large craters when they land, and photos of the area show no such crater. As a U.S. intelligence report wrote, “There was no observable damage to the main hospital building and no impact craters.”

Third, Israeli military officials released a recording that they said contained a conversation in Arabic between two Hamas members. One says that he has heard the missile “belongs to Palestinian Islamic Jihad.”

“It’s from us?” the other asks.

“It looks like it,” the first replies. He then adds that shrapnel appears to be “local shrapnel and not like Israeli shrapnel.”"
461,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/opinion/international-world/israel-gaza-palestinians-egypt.html,"In this period of intense Israeli military preparation following Hamas’s horrific terror attack on Oct. 7, and equally intense diplomatic activities surrounding the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, a crucial question has centered on Egypt’s role.

Why has Egypt appeared hesitant to relieve the humanitarian distress affecting Palestinian civilians on the other side of its eight -mile border with Gaza, especially since there really is no alternative to Cairo helping deal with the crisis?

Finding an answer lies in Egypt’s own challenges, and whether a nation with its own serious security problems and economic problems can be enough of a safe haven for others. Egypt has, along with Israel, blockaded Gaza on and off for 16 years, containing the enclave’s largely Muslim population while Cairo deals with its own insurgent threat in the area. It must worry about the political complications that could come from a large influx of Palestinians. Inevitably, Egypt will in some sense have to pivot, now, and treat those living a few miles away as neighbors in crisis, rather than a problem to be penned in.

The announcement on Wednesday that Israel has agreed to allow a batch of humanitarian supplies to enter Gaza from Egypt is surely welcome, as the aid will finally begin to address an extremely dire situation on the ground. Poverty and social-economic distress in Gaza were already serious problems before this war, with more than two million people crowded into one of the most densely populated areas of the world.

When I visited Gaza regularly in the early 1980s as part of my responsibilities then in the U.S. Embassy in Israel, the crisis was already evident — high unemployment, subsistence living conditions and a pervasive lack of hope. Over 16 years of Hamas’s control have worsened the situation considerably. Now, the Israeli siege in response to the Hamas attacks, including cuts to power, water supplies and communications amid continuing bombardment, has created even more catastrophic conditions.

Egypt has no love lost for Hamas, the Palestinian movement that is an offshoot of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian authorities have had a fractured relationship with the Brotherhood since its founding in 1928, including several serious and violent confrontations. Elements of a Brotherhood offshoot in the army — the Egyptian Islamic Jihad — were responsible for the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat. The movement helped influence militants such as Ayman al-Zawahri, who became a leading figure in Al Qaeda. Egypt’s self-interest has been to keep the Brotherhood in check, to deal with other extremist elements in Sinai and thus to be wary of Hamas, centered just across the border in Gaza.

At the same time, Egypt has managed to retain channels of communication with Hamas that have proven to be extremely important during the Islamist group’s frequent confrontations with Israel. Working alone, or in conjunction with Qatar, Turkey and Germany, among others, Egypt has jumped in early during these conflicts to help pave the way for a cease-fire and to start thinking about the post-conflict situation. This occurred in the extended Israel-Hamas war in 2014 and the confrontation in 2021. For this reason, and by virtue of Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula sitting on the other side of the Rafah crossing point, attention has focused on Egypt as a prime player in the effort to address the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza."
462,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/world/europe/premier-league-israel.html,"By the end of last week, England’s Football Association doubtless felt that it had done the best it could, that after hours and hours of talks, it had settled on what might best be described as the least worst option.

Last Friday night, England’s men’s team was playing an exhibition match against Australia. Most expected that the game would take note of the violence crackling across Israel and Gaza, commemorate the victims and acknowledge the suffering. Executives at the F.A. knew they would have to tread carefully.

They had weighed the risk that a minute’s silence, soccer’s traditional manifestation of grief, might be interrupted, but they determined that having it was the appropriate thing to do. There would be black armbands. And to ward off the chance that either Israeli or Palestinian flags might appear in the crowd, they declared that all banners except for those of the competing teams would be forbidden.

The most difficult decision, though, was to do with the Wembley Arch, the soaring steel beam that rises above the stadium."
463,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/podcasts/the-daily/israel-hostages-hamas.html,"So you can imagine what she would be going through if something happened to you.

So my son, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, is currently missing. He’s been missing since he attended the music festival that was in the southern part of Israel. And he was there Saturday morning when the terrorist event happened there. We received two text messages from him at 8:11, and that’s the last that we’ve heard of him.

And he would memorize every country in the world along with every capital, population, elevation. Just obsessed with travel. So for his bar mitzvah, he asked for only atlases, globes, and maps.

So he was born in Berkeley. And when he was going into second grade, our family moved to Jerusalem. He’s super bright, very curious, a voracious reader, and in love with travel. He’s had wanderlust since he was a little boy, to the point where he would read atlases and he’d get to the end and he’d start over, and get to the end and start over.

So Hersh, well, he’s the perfect son for me. There’s a lot of him that — it’s the good parts of me. He just turned 23 last week, on October 3.

So Friday night, we had this nice meal with our family, friends, and we kissed him goodbye. And he was in a great mood, and we had had a great time. And that’s the last time we saw him. And he and Aner Shapira, his best friend, met up and they went down south where this festival was. And, you know, both of them are unaccounted for.

And the other thing he’s passionate about is music festivals, specifically. And I think he just felt like he was going to a fun music festival here and ended in the worst way anybody could imagine.

And did you hear from him once he got there? What was the next thing that happened, Rachel?

And immediately I knew something terrible had happened because first of all, he would never just randomly write at 8:11 in the morning “I love you.” And the “I’m sorry” immediately, to me — I know him and he knows me so well, and my interpretation instantly was, I’m sorry because whatever is happening is going to cause you tremendous pain and tremendous worry. That was my first thought. And as it turns out, he was right.

And even though I’m not — I don’t use my phone on Shabbat, in cases of emergency, of course, you use your phone. And I thought, well, my son is somewhere and I don’t know where, and I’m turning on my phone to make sure he’s OK. And when I turned on my phone, two texts came in, both at 8:11. And the first text said, “I love you,” and the second text said, “I’m sorry.”

So I quickly came downstairs and woke up both of my daughters who were still sleeping so that we could get into our bomb shelter, which we have in our apartment. So we went into our bomb shelter, and then we waited for the all clear. You wait 10 minutes and if nothing else happens, you can come out.

No, the next thing that happened — so on the Jewish Sabbath, I actually don’t use my phone. And so he left. And the next morning, my husband had left for synagogue at 7:30 in the morning, and I was sitting, having a cup of tea. And sometime close to 8:00, we heard bomb sirens going off in Jerusalem.

Immediately I called him. And it rang and rang and rang and rang, and he didn’t answer. So I wrote a text, are you OK? And he didn’t answer. And five minutes later I said, let me know you’re OK. And then 10 minutes later I wrote, I’m leaving my phone on. Let me know you’re OK. But those were three unanswered. They haven’t been answered.

So we started — one of my daughters, the older daughter and I started to feverishly try to figure out where exactly was he sending this from. And my daughter sent me a video that had been going around from this music festival with people screaming, and you could hear shooting. And she said, is this the festival he’s at? Like, is this where he is?

And the truth is I didn’t know. So I took a screenshot of that, and I sent it to their other friend. And I asked, I said, are Hersh and Aner here? And he wrote back, yes. So I immediately knew they were there. And we started watching the news.

And then, all of a sudden, it was pandemonium everywhere. I mean, complete massacres taking place in all these different kibbutzes that are right on the border. I mean, it was complete — it was war. And so we were frantic and we were in a panic. But his friend had already made a missing poster that was of Hersh and Aner and saying they were at the thing. Do you have any information? Did you see them?

And he had already posted that on all these social media places that I, as a 53-year-old mother, know nothing about. So it was very, very helpful that Yaniv, their third friend, was doing this. And it was through that that, a few hours later, probably around noon, that we got a picture from inside of a bomb shelter.

And we could see on the side, sort of midway on the left side, we could see Hersh in profile. And where the door was — and it was just a normal-sized door — we could see Aner. At first we were like, oh my gosh, thank God because this means they weren’t killed at the festival. Because we already had heard there were scores, if not hundreds, of people — we now know it’s close to 300 people — were killed at this festival.

And what we now understand, from eyewitnesses that we ended up talking to, is that Hersh and Aner and another boy named Yoad and they had driven down together. And they got in the car to drive away. And then the sirens started going off, which meant there were more incoming rockets from Gaza. And when rockets are falling, you get off the road and you get into a shelter.

So they had stopped the car to get into the shelter, and there were five other cars that also pulled over. And it was also people from the music festival, and they all ran in together. They weren’t friends but, I mean, they had all just been at this event together.

So at first, we were so happy that we were like, oh, that’s wonderful. They’re in a bomb shelter. They’re safe. And in the picture, they don’t look panicked. Like there’s people who have sunglasses on their heads. And someone’s looking at their phone. They don’t look like they’re in panic. They look like they’re Israeli young people who are hanging out in a bomb shelter because yeah, yeah, maybe there’s some sort of siren going off because maybe something’s happening outside.

But then we realized, when was this taken and why haven’t we heard from him? And we were making up all sorts of excuses. Oh, his phone must have died; or when they were running away, he dropped his phone, so that’s why he didn’t answer me.

What we subsequently found out is that around 8:30, the terrorists came to the door of the bomb shelter and apparently started throwing grenades, hand grenades into the shelter, which is like fish in a barrel. You know, there’s 30 people smashed in there. Apparently, I don’t know, I think someone told me at some point, you know you usually have 10 to 15 people in those.

So you had this massive packed group of people. And Aner was closest to the door. He apparently, from all accounts, was the complete hero.

He quickly — because you only — from the time a pin on a grenade is cold, you have 4.5 seconds until it explodes. And he was quickly picking them up and throwing them back. And they were spraying machine gun fire into there. So it was craziness and horrible.

And what we know now is many of those young people were killed. Many were severely, extremely wounded. And a few were wounded but not horribly. And some of them pretended to be dead. And what we did get eyewitness accounts of is that Hersh’s arm below the elbow was blown off.

And I think he must have been in complete shock because we heard that he made a tourniquet. He didn’t cry out. He didn’t lose consciousness. Then the terrorists came in and at gunpoint said, everyone who can stand up, stand up and walk out. And six of them walked out, including Hersh.

It was four young men and two young women. They were put on a pickup truck, and they were driven off by these terrorists. And that was around 9:00. And the police actually let us know that the last time that Hersh’s phone was — you know how they can trace phones — where they were last seen was on the border with Gaza.

Now, we have no proof that — you know, maybe someone stole his phone. Maybe it doesn’t necessarily mean anything. The assumption is that they are all — all six of those kids are kidnapped. And none of the parents that we’ve spoken to of those six kids, none of us have had any sort of word from our children.

Sadly, we do have — there was a girl who played dead who was next to Hersh. And there was a young man who shared a lot of information. And there was another young woman who was much more able just to share with us, the girl who was right next to Hersh. She’s so horribly traumatized that it’s even hard for her still, today. She can’t really speak.

So we don’t have confirmation, a lot because there’s such pandemonium still here. So that’s where we are. And what we want now is, first of all, we want to really make sure that Hersh has his arm tended to. He really needs medical treatment immediately, urgently. And obviously, what we really want is we want him to be sitting next to me right now."
464,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-hamas-palestinians.html,"Nearly 50 years to the day after the Yom Kippur war of 1973, Israel has again been taken by surprise by a sudden attack, a startling reminder that stability in the Middle East remains a bloody mirage.

Unlike the series of clashes with Palestinian forces in Gaza over the last three years, this appears to be a full-scale conflict mounted by Hamas and its allies, with rocket barrages and incursions into Israel proper, and with Israelis killed and captured.

The psychological impact on Israelis has been compared to the shock of Sept. 11 in America. So after the Israeli military repels the initial Palestinian attack, the question of what to do next will loom large. There are few good options for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has declared war and is being pressured into a major military response.

Given that 250 Israelis have died so far and an unknown number been taken hostage by Hamas, an Israeli invasion of Gaza — and even a temporary reoccupation of the territory, something that successive Israeli governments have tried hard to avoid — cannot be ruled out."
465,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/nyregion/college-protest-israel-palestine.html,"Concerns about reprisal are only the most visible difference in modern protests. The more meaningful shift can be seen in the tenor of campus activism, where historically, a passionate if monolithic view has formed around a grievance, or set of grievances, directed at a consensus enemy. In the late 1960s, it was a unified student body protesting Richard Nixon and the Pentagon; in the ’80s, the apartheid government of South Africa; in the decades ahead, the fossil fuel industry.

In nearly every case, the university itself has stood as co-defendant — an adversary by way of its complicity in whatever injustice, through its morally compromised research or financial investments.

But a different dynamic seemed to be emerging against the backdrop of vastly different expectations. Where the two sides at N.Y.U. converged, beyond the matter of their shared anxiety, was the belief that the university was inadequately supporting them. The day of the protest, an opinion piece in The Washington Square News, the campus newspaper, criticized the university for its “failure to acknowledge its Palestinian students and the pain they are shouldering.”

The writer argued that when “a university ignores its students’ pain, histories and well-being, it fails to serve its communities” and that doing nothing would leave vulnerable students “even more susceptible to potential harm.” Uptown, a similar piece landed in The Columbia Spectator on the same day, titled: “Columbia, You Are Failing Your Palestinian, Muslim, Arab, Black, Brown, and Jewish Student Activists.”

Even though letters sent to the community — from N.Y.U.’s president, Linda Mills, and later, in light of Ryna Workman’s remarks, from the dean of the law school — resolutely condemned Hamas’s attack on Israel, some students felt that the response from the administration has been tepid. At the rally, I approached two students who stood with Israel and handed me a flyer with a picture of an 8-year-old Israeli girl who had been kidnapped by Hamas. One of them, a junior at Stern, N.Y.U.’s business school, identified himself as an Orthodox Jew whose great-grandparents had been imprisoned at Auschwitz and whose parents were in Israel at the beginning of the attacks and found themselves in a bomb shelter.

He showed me a video of students tearing down fliers like the one he had handed me, which had been posted around campus. He was angry that letters to the administrators asking for some sort of action to be taken were not sufficiently acknowledged. He imagined an entirely different and urgent reaction, he said, if the child in the picture had been African American.

The campus protests of the late 1960s sought in part to dismantle the in loco parentis role that colleges and universities had held in American life. But the past two decades have been shaped by a reversal of that, as institutions have sought to reconstruct this role in response to what students and parents paying enormous sums for their education have seemed to want. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, during the 2020-21 fiscal year, private four-year colleges spent 40 percent of their budgets on student support services. Over the span of the past 20 years, the dollar amount has more than tripled.

The letter from N.Y.U.’s president, in fact, made reference to some of these services, pointing out that the university’s division of student affairs had reached out “to all students from the affected areas with offers of support and help,” and that students had available to them “24/7” help “through the Wellness Exchange,” a counseling service. But in this especially challenging moment, that seemed not to be enough.

Young people now arrive at elite colleges with the assumption that not only will they be seen, heard and meticulously cared for, but also that their own politics will broadly align with those of the institutions they have chosen to attend. They have been given little reason to think otherwise.

Students, administrators and faculty, at least at places like N.Y.U. and Columbia, shared an antagonism to the Trump presidency and to the police abuses at the heart of the Black Lives Matter movement. Ten years ago, when the former New York City police commissioner, Ray Kelly, was invited to speak at Brown University, students objected. When the administration had him come anyway, protesters interrupted his talk so formidably that the event was shut down.

The current campus protests reflect the limits of the more bonded relationship that students and universities have forged. Presidents beholden to wealthy donors have in many instances been urged by them to stand unequivocally for Israel. This week, John Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah and a major donor to the University of Pennsylvania, announced that he and his family would cut their funding because, in his view, the school had not done that. Students, in so many instances, have sought something different. They want their ideas and passions validated. They have rarely experienced the alternative."
466,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/opinion/harvard-penn-donors.html,"The author of this newsletter takes a generally dim view of wealthy donors who give lots of money to America’s richest universities, and an especially critical view of those who do so despite harboring strong objections to the leftward ideological drift of those same institutions.

But the ongoing donor revolts at a few notable schools — following administrative temporizing over the proper response to Hamas’s massacre of Israeli civilians and pro-Hamas statements by certain student groups — offer an opportunity to be constructive and prescriptive, not just critical. So for any rich person or rich foundation currently reconsidering the way they give to elite academia, here are some thoughts about the modern university landscape and what money can and can’t accomplish therein.

First, Jewish donors probably can’t win the identity politics game. This point is made effectively by Jason Willick in The Washington Post, responding to those donors who seem primarily upset by the delay in official recognition of Israeli suffering and whose main desire seems to be that schools like Cornell or the University of Pennsylvania “acknowledge a cause near to their hearts as readily as they acknowledge other causes.”

The problem, Willick points out, is that neither Israeli nor American Jewish interests have a strong position in the inverted hierarchy that dominates academic discourse. The State of Israel is too powerful, notwithstanding its cruel enemies, and broadly speaking American Jews are too materially successful to fit neatly on the “oppressed” side of the oppressor/oppressed binary. And the conspiratorial side of contemporary progressivism, its constant focus on “the domination of the powerless by the powerful,” can blur into old-fashioned antisemitic narratives, with the specter of Jewish privilege lurking behind the language of “white privilege.” (A recent study in the Journal of Race, Ethnicity and Politics found that Hispanics and African Americans agreed with antisemitic statements at rates similar to white Americans who identify with the alt-right — not an ideal indicator for the Jewish position within the circle of progressive allyship.)

This leads Willick to conclude, correctly, that Jewish donors would be wise to urge college administrations to step back from public political interventions and make stronger commitments to free speech, rather than just trying to make sure that Jews get their share of identitarian solicitude.

But this strategy also has inherent limits, insofar as the free speech protected by campus administrators is only as diverse as the people who are speaking. Which brings us to the second point for would-be reshapers of the university: If you can’t influence faculty hiring and tenure, you may be wasting your money.

A wise friend of mine compared the modern university to a complex medieval church-state arrangement, with administrators as the secular power and faculty as the priests and monks. Donors have leverage over the president’s office and so they naturally focus on ways to use those levers, to get presidents and administrators to fear their wrath (or stinginess) and respond quickly to their criticisms. But if you’re concerned about what gets taught and published and believed, you’re ultimately concerned with priestcraft, and the priests jealously guard their clerical independence and resist the impositions of administrators, let alone donors trying to work their own will through the president’s office.

As, to be clear, they should: Any conservative or small-l liberal model of a university assumes that the faculty, not the administrative caste, should be in charge of education. But if that’s the case and you’re a donor concerned about the substance of elite education, trying to exert pressure through the administrative system can be an exercise in futility. What you want is a theory of how to address the increasing ideological conformism of the actual professoriate — meaning both the disappearance of explicitly conservative faculty (a trend that predates the era of Donald Trump) and the greater pressure on moderate-liberal faculty as their left flank becomes ever stronger and their right flank disappears.

Such a theory might involve founding or funding centers or programs within universities that are committed to heterodoxy in some form. It might mean pressuring universities to commit to a project of intellectual diversification in hiring to match other commitments to diversity. It might mean finding a specific faculty member or a group of faculty members who need financial support and can use that support productively.

But in each case the goal shouldn’t be to simply protect an embattled unwoke professor here or there. You want your money to support a system where ideological diversity increases with every round of tenuring, where heterodoxy reproduces itself rather than being frozen in tokenism.

And if that’s your goal, you need to be aware of the third point, which is that real influence requires working with the grain of academic culture, not just seeking confrontation. When donors become disillusioned with their alma maters, a frequent impulse is to turn to culture-war and cancellation tactics — funding student groups that bring the most controversial possible speaker to campus pour épater les wokes, generating maximal controversy around a particularly radical faculty member or (as we’ve seen in the past few weeks) trying to impose real-world consequences on student radicalism by making it harder for the radicals to get high-paying jobs.

There is a rough justice to some of these efforts, and there’s certainly no inherent right to maintain a zealous commitment to dismantling the patriarchal violence of settler-colonialist white supremacy while also getting the Big Law job of your meritocratic dreams. But when donors turn to these methods, they are mostly giving up on constructive change within the school, because the effect within the academy is to ratify a fear of donor influence, a hostility to anything touched by anti-woke or centrist or conservative ideas. A few radical-but-careerist students may shut up, a few faculty leftists may tweet more prudently, but behind the scenes the left will claim vindication in its effort to keep any to-the-right-of-Bernie-Sanders influence at bay. (“See, you can’t work with them. They hate us for our academic freedom.”)

Yes, you can temper this left-wing vindication by closing up your checkbook, but — final point — elite universities are the hardest places to influence or punish, because they’re already so rich. Will the University of Pennsylvania miss the collection of major donors who’ve denounced the school in the past week? No doubt. Can the University of Pennsylvania survive a fair amount of donor flight, given that it’s managing an endowment worth $21 billion? You do the math.

Which brings us back to my own bias against giving to such institutions in the first place. If you want actual influence over American academic life, you’re just much better off finding a smaller or poorer school where your money will be welcomed, your opportunities to effect real transformation will be ample and your millions can build something dynamic or beautiful without always fighting through the thicket of powerful interest groups that grows up around powerful institutions. And to harp again on a frequent theme, if you’re absurdly, obscenely rich and care about higher education, you should Google “Leland Stanford” and then go and do likewise.

But I also understand that it’s hard to let go of the place where you yourself went to college, where you were young and happy oh-so-many years ago. In which case our disillusioned donors should consider choosing neither the waste of giving directly to schools whose ideology they now oppose nor the dubious satisfactions of doing battle with that ideology while possibly helping to entrench it.

If their memories of student life are what drives their generosity, then donors should find ways to give money to the actual students — through the Hillel or other Jewish or Israeli student groups if you’re especially concerned with the Jewish place on campus, but more generally through political or religious groups that promise to work against the school’s dominant assumptions, or through student associations that seem to foster free debate, or through campus-adjacent institutions that serve students but are independent of the schools.

But not with the goal of using such student groups as a means of conflict with the administration or the faculty. Rather, with the goal that such groups can become microcosms of the university you loved once and fear no longer exists, cells in a body yet to be restored, whose health and flourishing within the large world of Penn or Harvard or wherever is an end unto itself.

This Week in Decadence

We have since at least the middle of the 20th century, prompted by the ideological desolation following World War II, been sliding into historical despair. This has been consolidated in the early 21st century by the increasing popularity of unfalsifiable identitarian doctrines stemming from the work of Foucault and his acolytes. Much of Foucault’s most popular work revolves around suggestions that all social connections are zero-sum power relations, and that “truth” is a purely subjective concept. This has led to a sentimentalization of history among the most highly educated and, subsequently, a revulsion toward it. Even where a belief that history is where bad people live does not take hold in the individual, it forms a kind of miasma swirling around the resistant individual which that individual must then expend great energy to fight against — and it is a draining and emotionally taxing fight, for they who know that history is more than something to get upset about also know that all our hopes for the future lay in its archives. Historical despair is anathema to high ambition — for reasons that are simultaneously empirically undeniable and fundamentally elliptical, feeling that one is part of a historical continuum, with a proper means to build upon the work and the example of exalted forebears, is what stimulates a great deal of worthy work.

President Biden used a rare address from the Oval Office last night to urge Americans to support war efforts in Israel and Ukraine, as Israeli troops amassed ahead of a possible ground invasion of the Gaza Strip and exchanged fire with Hezbollah forces near the border with Lebanon.

Worries are growing about how much the turmoil could cost the global economy. Biden is expected to ask Congress to approve $14 billion in military aid for Israel and $60 billion for Ukraine — no easy task with the House still without a leader — as part of a jumbo $100 billion aid package.

The risk of wider conflict is again roiling the markets. A U.S. Navy warship shot down missiles and drones launched by Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, and American military bases in Syria and Iraq have come under drone attack, too.

Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, hit a three-week high this on Fridayfears that a military escalation could disrupt already tight supplies. Asian and European stocks and U.S. futures were in the red, adding to Thursday’s losses.

The Fed is watching the region closely. In a speech largely focused on inflation, interest rates and economic growth, Jay Powell, the central bank’s chair, warned on Thursday that “geopolitical tensions are highly elevated and pose important risks to global economic activity.”

The Middle East is becoming a wild card for the global economy. Rising oil prices could push up inflation, hindering central banks’ efforts to bring down prices. Higher energy costs could also force businesses and consumers to cut back on spending. That would probably sap growth but might also slow the economy enough to negate the need for an additional interest-rate increase.

The Fed, Powell said, would “monitor these developments for their economic implications, which remain highly uncertain.”

Powell had a more immediate concern: that the economy might be running too hot — consumers are spending and hiring remains brisk — despite a rapid rise in interest rates to a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent. Policymakers remain divided over whether to raise rates at least one more time.

Powell reiterated that he’s in the wait-and-see camp. There was a steep sell-off in bonds on Thursday after his speech, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury coming within a tick of the 16-year high of 5 percent.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING

Jim Jordan pursues another run at House speaker. The far-right Ohio lawmaker pushed for a third vote to become leader, scheduled for 10 a.m. Eastern, after his supporters rebelled against efforts to empower the interim speaker, Representative Patrick McHenry, to lead legislative business for a short time. Jordan appears set to lose again, prolonging the paralysis.

The Hollywood actors’ union insists there’s no movement in talks with studios. Fran Drescher, the president of SAG-AFTRA, said an unusual proposal led by George Clooney to have A-list stars defray $150 million in costs for media companies by paying higher dues — a plan meant to help end the strike — didn’t alter the state of negotiations. “What we are fighting for in terms of benefits has to remain in this contract,” Drescher said.

Sidney Powell pleads guilty in Georgia’s election fraud case. The move by Powell, who was part of Donald Trump’s legal team in 2020, means she is likely to testify against the former president about accusations he tried to subvert the state’s election results. Her testimony could also aid the federal election case against Trump.

China limits exports of a crucial material for electric vehicle batteries. Beijing, which dominates global production of graphite, will now require special permits from producers to ship it overseas because of what it says are national security concerns. The measures were announced days after the U.S. imposed tighter restrictions on sales of more advanced semiconductors to China."
469,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/us/politics/us-missiles-yemen.html,"A U.S. Navy warship in the northern Red Sea on Thursday shot down three cruise missiles and several drones launched from Yemen that the Pentagon said might have been headed toward Israel.

“We cannot say for certain what these missiles and drones were targeting, but they were launched from Yemen heading north along the Red Sea, potentially towards targets in Israel,” Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters.

The missiles and drones were launched by pro-Iranian Houthi rebels in Yemen amid a flurry of drone attacks against American troops in Iraq and Syria over the past three days, General Ryder said. The incidents underscored the risks that the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas could spiral into a wider war.

Military analysts were trying to determine who carried out the drone attacks, General Ryder said, but Iran-backed militias have in the past conducted drone and rocket attacks against the 2,500 American troops based in Iraq and the 900 troops in Syria.

Since Hamas’s terrorist attacks against Israel on Oct. 7, the Biden administration has rushed two aircraft carriers and additional troops to the eastern Mediterranean near Israel to deter Iran and its proxies in the region from engaging in a regional war.

Israel has responded to the Hamas attacks with airstrikes and a “complete siege” of Gaza, which the group controls.

Senior Biden administration officials and American commanders have expressed fears that the United States could get dragged into the conflict if the militias attacked U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria.

General Ryder sought to stay on that theme on Thursday despite what he acknowledged was “an uptick” in drone attacks in Iraq and Syria in the past few days.

“Right now, this conflict is contained between Israel and Hamas, and we’re going to do everything we can to ensure deterrence in the region, so that this does not become a broader” conflict, General Ryder said.

Iranian officials, however, have publicly warned that new fronts against Israel could open in the region if its offensive on Gaza continued.

A deputy commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, Gholamhossein Gheybparvar, said in a speech on Thursday that Iran-backed militia in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon — known as an “axis of resistance” — were ready to strike Israel if its ground forces invaded Gaza.

On Wednesday, Iran’s state television aired a segment detailing how such attacks could unfold.

The report opened with the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying that if the war continued “nobody could stop the forces of the resistance,” referring to a network of militia groups across the region supported by Iran.

Houthis in Yemen from the south, Syrian and Iraqi militias from the east, and Hezbollah in Lebanon from the north would coordinate to attack Israel with missiles and drones to create “a siege from every side,” the report claimed. The segment said that the Houthis had missiles with a range of more than 1,200 miles.

The report said Iraqi militia groups had taken positions alongside Syrian militias near the Golan Heights, an area Israel captured from Syria in 1967 and later annexed.

Iran’s state television routinely broadcasts propaganda and hyperbole, and the military threats could be part of a strategy to fuel growing anxiety in the region.

At the Pentagon on Thursday, General Ryder said that any armed American response to this week’s attacks, “should one occur, will come at a time and a manner of our choosing.”

In March, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that a self-destructing drone of “Iranian origin” killed a U.S. contractor and injured another contractor and five U.S. service members in an attack on a maintenance facility on a coalition base in northeast Syria.

President Biden retaliated by ordering the Pentagon to carry out airstrikes against facilities in eastern Syria used by groups affiliated with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards.

The latest spate of attacks continued on Wednesday morning when U.S. and coalition forces at the Al Tanf base in southern Syria fired on two drones, destroying one, while the other slammed into the base, causing “minor injuries,” General Ryder said.

About 200 American troops are stationed at Al Tanf, whose main role is training Syrian militias to fight the Islamic State.

At the same time on Wednesday, alert sirens wailed at Al Asad Air Base, a sprawling installation in western Iraq. Though no drone or rocket attacks happened, a civilian contractor, whom the military did not identify, suffered a heart attack while sheltering and died soon afterward, General Ryder said.

On Wednesday, the military’s Central Command said that it had intercepted several drones in Iraq in the previous 24 hours that were menacing American military and other allied personnel in the country.

American forces attacked two drones at Al Asad, destroying one and damaging the other, resulting in “minor injuries” to coalition troops, the command said in a statement. Separately, in northern Iraq, the military destroyed one drone, resulting in no injuries, the command said.

There were unconfirmed reports on social media of additional drone attacks in Syria late Thursday.

“Clearly, this is an uptick in terms of the types of drone activity we’ve seen in Iraq and Syria,” General Ryder said.

Pentagon officials warned that the cruise-missile and drone attacks could augur an escalation of violence that could endanger American forces in the region and potentially draw them into a conflict.

In November 2021, American and Israeli officials said that an armed drone strike a month earlier against Al Tanf was Iranian retaliation for Israeli airstrikes in Syria.

The attack caused no casualties, but it represented the first time Iran had directed a military strike against the United States in response to an attack by Israel."
470,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/world/europe/interpreter-laws-human-shields-forced-displacement.html,"As the Israel-Hamas war continues, its rising civilian death toll has raised more questions about what is allowed under the international laws that govern the waging of war. These rules are remarkably clear in some areas, as I wrote last week, and experts said they had been gravely breached by Hamas in its massacres of civilians and taking of hostages, and by Israel when it announced a complete siege of Gaza that cut off water, food and fuel to over 2 million inhabitants.

In the intervening days, two other legal issues have come to the fore: Hamas’s alleged use of civilians as human shields in the Gaza Strip, and Israel’s order on Friday that all civilians must evacuate from Northern Gaza.

War is politically and emotionally complex, and this conflict is no exception. Tuesday’s blast at the Ahli Arab Hospital compound in Gaza City — which Palestinian militant groups blamed on Israel and Israel blamed on one of them — underscored the horrific human toll of modern warfare.

It remains helpful to remember, amid the sorrow and anger over the ongoing violence, that the core principles of humanitarian law are simple. Civilians must be protected. They cannot legally be targets of violence, or disproportionately harmed by it. And those obligations apply to all parties involved in the fighting, even if the other side has violated them.

“Human shields” are still protected civilians.

Israel has long accused Hamas of using civilians as “human shields.” On Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel told President Biden that Hamas is perpetrating “a double war crime, targeting our civilians while hiding behind their civilians.”

The use of human shields is considered a war crime as well as a violation of humanitarian law.

But even if one side intentionally jeopardizes civilians in this way — either by forcing them to remain near military targets or by placing military targets in or adjacent to the same buildings as civilians — those noncombatants are still entitled to full protections under humanitarian law, experts say. That means that when attacking Hamas, Israel must still weigh the proportionality of any harm to human shields and other nearby civilians. If the harm to them is disproportionate to the military objective, the attack is illegal under international law."
471,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/world/middleeast/gaza-hospital-blast-deaths.html,"American intelligence agencies have assessed that a deadly blast at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday killed 100 to 300 people, a more conservative estimate than that given by officials in Gaza, and that the hospital suffered light damage.

The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza gave the death toll as 471, revising its earlier assertion of 500 dead.

The unclassified assessment drafted by U.S. intelligence agencies on Wednesday cautioned that the casualty assessments could change.

U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the latest information, said the death toll was likely at the low end of that estimate. But even if it is revised downward further, officials emphasized that the blast had still caused a significant loss of life. U.S. officials did not say what intelligence led them to their estimated death toll.

Palestinian officials have blamed an Israeli airstrike for the blast, an assertion that was disputed by the Israel Defense Forces, which said it was caused by an errant rocket fired by the armed Palestinian faction Islamic Jihad in Gaza. Neither side’s account could be independently verified.

The U.S. assessment, which concurs that Israel was not responsible for the blast at Ahli Arab hospital, highlights how much U.S. officials still do not know about the blast at the hospital, what exactly caused it and how many lives were lost there. Officials were examining the reports of relatively light damage to the hospital and adjacent structures to try to find clues about what precisely happened.

The war between Israel and Hamas has also spawned so much false or misleading information online — much of it intentional, though not all — that it is often hard to ascertain what is actually happening on the ground.

The U.S. intelligence agencies’ assessment that Israel was not responsible for the explosion was based on videos collected by civilians, satellite imagery, missile activity tracked by infrared sensors and other data. But intelligence officials cautioned that they do not fully understand what happened at the hospital and are continuing to collect information. The unclassified report reflects U.S. officials’ evolving knowledge of the events.

“Israel Probably Did Not Bomb Gaza Strip Hospital,” said the unclassified intelligence assessment drafted on Wednesday. “We judge that Israel was not responsible for an explosion that killed hundreds of civilians yesterday [17 October] at the Al Ahli Hospital in the Gaza Strip.”

The unclassified documents are written in the style of the U.S. spy agencies, full of standard caveats that their understanding of events may change.

The United States has infrared sensors, which are both satellite and aircraft based, that can determine the launch sites of a variety of rockets and missiles. That technology has proved critical to the U.S. assessment, which does not lay blame for the blast on Israel.

On Wednesday, U.S. officials said the intelligence indicated that there had been a launch of a rocket or missile from Palestinian fighter positions within Gaza. But they were uncertain about how an errant Palestinian rocket could have caused so much loss of life at the hospital.

In Thursday’s assessment, the intelligence agencies said they “continue to work to corroborate” whether the explosion was caused by a failed Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket. The U.S. officials said that Israeli officials had intercepted communications that indicated some militants in Gaza believed the explosion was caused by an errant rocket or missile launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

U.S. intelligence agencies have reported to the White House and Congress their assessment that there was only light structural damage to the hospital following the blast, and no impact craters at the hospital. Two structures near the main hospital took minor damage to their roofs, but remained intact.

On Wednesday, U.S. officials said they were looking closely at an explosion next to the hospital in its courtyard or parking lot, to see if that was responsible for some or much of the loss of life. It is possible that a rocket hit a parking lot near the hospital where people were gathered, but American officials are trying to learn more.

A freelance videographer working for The New York Times who visited the scene the day after the explosion filmed footage showing a small impact crater. Other photos and video footage show the same, including the Israeli military’s aerial image. It is as yet unclear whether the crater is related to the explosion and if any conclusions can be drawn from it."
472,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/us/politics/biden-israel-ukraine.html,"President Biden could very well go down in history as the last American president born during World War II and shaped by a view of American power nurtured in the Cold War. No other leader on the world stage today can boast that they sat in the Israeli prime minister’s office 50 years ago with Golda Meir, or discussed dismantling Soviet nuclear weapons with Mikhail Gorbachev.

So perhaps it is no surprise that the twin wars in which Mr. Biden has chosen to insert the United States — defending Ukraine as it tries to repel a nuclear-armed invader, and now promising aid to Israel in wiping out the leadership of Hamas — have brought out a passion, emotion and a clarity that is usually missing from the president’s ordinarily flat and meandering speeches.

It rang out on Thursday evening, as Mr. Biden combined the two struggles in his Oval Office address, declaring that while President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Hamas “represent different threats,” they “both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy.”

Throughout the speech, Mr. Biden toggled between the two crises, making the case that if America does not stand up in both conflicts the result will be “more chaos and death and more destruction.” That argument reflects his certainty that this is the moment he has trained for his entire political career, a point he often makes when challenged about his age.

His sense of mission explains why, at age 80, he has in the past eight months visited two countries in the midst of active wars. But at the same time he has married his public embraces with private cautions to American allies, while carefully keeping American troops out of both conflicts — so far. He seems determined to prove that for all the critiques that the United States is a divided, declining power, it remains the only nation that can mold events in a world of unpredictable mayhem.

“When presidents get into their sweet spot you usually see and hear it, and in the past few weeks you have seen and heard it,” said Michael Beschloss, the historian and author of “Presidents of War,” which traces the rocky history of Mr. Biden’s predecessors as they plunged into global conflicts, avoided a few, and sometimes came to regret their choices.

Whether Mr. Biden can bring the American population along, however, is a more unsettled question than at any moment in his presidency, and was the backdrop of his Oval Office address.

Polls show that a growing number of Americans are uneasy with the role of defender of the existing order, and the existing rules, that Mr. Biden describes as the essence of America. In the generation in which he grew up, his Thursday declaration that “American leadership is what holds the world together” would have been uncontroversial. Today it is a central point of debate, along with his insistence that “American alliances are what keep us, America, safe.”

For Mr. Biden, the democratic order is at risk if the rest of the world balks at toppling Hamas and neutralizing Russia. But he is finding that a far harder case to make now than in February 2022, when Mr. Putin tried a lightning-strike attack to overthrow an imperfect democracy in Ukraine and restore the Russian empire of Peter the Great.

The initial overwhelming support for Ukraine — one of the few issues that seemed to unify Democrats and Republicans — is clearly shattering, with a growing part of the Republican Party arguing that this is not America’s fight. The slog across the Donbas, and the prospect of a long conflict in which Mr. Putin is waiting to see if America will elect former President Donald J. Trump or someone of similar antipathy to the war effort, only complicates the picture."

On the other wait more than two million Gazans now scraping by on dwindling stocks of basic human necessities.

Between them stand a series of locked gates and fences topped with razor wire, and nearly a week of diplomatic wrangling that finally appears to be bearing results. Officials and aid workers on Thursday were hammering out the logistics of opening the gates, saying that a United Nations-led deal had laid the groundwork to allow trucks carrying humanitarian aid to enter Gaza from Egypt, offering the renewed promise of relief to the besieged enclave.

Aid organizations were told that the crossing would open on Friday morning, according to an aid official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The deal, officials said, includes the U.N. flag being raised at the crossing and international observers inspecting aid trucks before they enter Gaza. The arrangement is meant to satisfy demands by Israel, which is at war with Hamas, that none of the aid reach the group that controls Gaza and that the shipments not be used to smuggle weapons.

Opening the border crossing at the Gazan city of Rafah — the sole official passage between the territory and Egypt — has taken on particular urgency with the enclave sinking into a deepening humanitarian crisis."

The line of demarcation was Wadi Gaza, a strip of wetlands that stretches latitudinally across the territory.

Khan Younis is well south of that marker, but the area has seen numerous airstrikes, even as it struggles to accommodate Gazans fleeing the north. Satellite images showed damage from airstrikes around the southern Gaza Strip that was not as extensive as in the northern part, but still significant.

Photographs taken in and around Khan Younis on Monday and Tuesday show a desperate struggle to survive in Gaza, where about half the population are children and teenagers. These images were taken before the explosion on Tuesday near the Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, north of the demarcation line, which, Palestinian officials said, killed hundreds.

Many of those displaced from northern Gaza crowded into hospitals and schools in the south. Others were hosted by friends and relatives already struggling to find enough food and water for themselves."

The U.N. has made progress on an agreement that lays the groundwork for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza from Egypt, two officials said, although the details of how and when the desperately needed food and medicine would be delivered were not immediately disclosed.

Under the agreement, international observers would inspect aid trucks before they enter Gaza to satisfy a demand by Israel, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Previous reports of imminent agreements to ease the backup at Gaza’s border with Egypt — both for people and aid — have failed to materialize. Egypt said it would allow 20 aid trucks into the enclave, according to President Biden, but the timing is unclear. Hopes are high that the aid trucks will be able to cross into Gaza today, according to E.U. officials.

The toll: Gaza health officials said at a news conference that at least 3,785 people had been killed in the enclave since Oct. 7. The figures are believed to include casualties from the hospital explosion in Gaza City, for which Hamas and Israel blame each other. U.S. intelligence agencies estimate the blast killed between 100 and 300 people, but cautioned that their assessments could change."
476,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/opinion/israel-hamas-attacks-palestinians.html,"Instead, it was an opportunity. We watched the marketing of a massacre.

Much has been written and spoken about some progressive groups and many progressive students (and faculty members) at American colleges, who reacted to the hunting, the shooting, the slashing, the burning of all those people in Israel by blaming … Israel. They were referring, obviously, to a conflict larger and more complicated than Hamas terrorists’ treatment of that music festival as a shooting gallery, the torching of Israeli villages and the kidnapping of 200 people, an overwhelming majority of them civilians. They were looking at a longer history.

Still, their inability to distinguish the hours of Oct. 7 from the decades that preceded it — and to look squarely and with proper condemnation at a given sequence of events — was unsettling. As Ezekiel J. Emanuel wrote in Times Opinion just days ago: “It is possible to condemn the barbarism of Hamas and condemn the endless Israeli occupation of the West Bank. So, too, is it possible to condemn the treatment of women and the L.G.B.T.Q. community in Arab lands and the attempt by right-wing Israeli politicians to neuter Israel’s Supreme Court.”

But it is impossible to do that if you navigate all events, all disputes, with a prefabricated compass, a preformulated message that you graft onto everything, no matter how awkward the fit. It is impossible to do that if you are taking your cues from a political or ideological tribe and making sure that you utter the lines it seems to want you to say.

That’s what many of those students did after Oct. 7. It was a version of virtue signaling. I know that from my own conversations with young men and women at Duke, where I teach, who conceded that they felt a vague pressure to make some kind of statement, take some sort of stand. Many looked to see what their friends were doing. Then they brought themselves into conformity with it.

Why should they be any different from the so-called adults in this country? A few of the grown-ups with chapters of the Democratic Socialists of America or Black Lives Matter hastened to stress that the Palestinians’ plight in Gaza and in the West Bank was their plight in the United States. They were all joined in a universal struggle."

In a letter signed by 20 senators, the lawmakers also expressed concerns that a new U.S. defense treaty with Saudi Arabia — which Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is insisting be part of a deal to normalize relations with Israel — could enmesh the United States even deeper in the Middle East.

“A high degree of proof would be required,” the letter reads, “to show that a binding defense treaty with Saudi Arabia — an authoritarian regime which regularly undermines U.S. interests in the region, has a deeply concerning human rights record and has pursued an aggressive and reckless foreign policy agenda — aligns with U.S. interests.”"

The best way to describe the state of Republican leadership in the House of Representatives is with just one word — chaos. There hasn’t been a Speaker of the House in several days in spite of multiple crises unfolding across the globe, most notably in Israel and Ukraine. At the time of this recording, we don’t have a Speaker of the House.

The Republican Party is far from united on multiple key issues. And one of those key issues is funding for Ukraine. And this has been a matter of contention, building really for months, and shows no sign of abating. And this is particularly important because the amount of money already allocated for Ukraine is being drawn down even as we speak.

The stakes really could not be higher for Ukraine. They need American aid to stay in the fight.

So the White House is looking at an aid package for both Ukraine and Israel that could run as high as $100 billion. We’re talking about providing stability and funding for Ukraine and Israel in the short to medium-term. We’re talking about sending a message to our enemies.

And we’re also talking about sending a message to our friends that the United States is still the sword and shield of liberal democracy in the world, and that you can, in fact, count on the United States of America to preserve a rules-based international order that has imperfectly succeeded in keeping great power peace for generations.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Essentially, for additional aid to pass, House Republicans have to allow a vote, because it is still the case that a majority of the House, a strong majority of the House, supports aid for Ukraine. It’s definitely the case that a majority of the House supports aid for Israel. In both cases, you have majority support. But the question is, would a new speaker allow such a bill to come to the floor ultimately?

Jim Jordan, who has put himself forward as a speaker candidate, is part of the Freedom Caucus. And this is the group that has caused the most chaos in the House, and this is the group that if it gets its way, we’ll see American support either taper off for Ukraine or stop entirely. Many House Republicans, including members of the Freedom Caucus, apply America-first analysis when they’re talking about Ukraine. For example, they will say we need to secure the border here before we fund anyone else over there.

But that analysis doesn’t apply as much to Israel. There’s a couple of reasons for this. One, there is a long-standing bond between rank and file Republicans and the nation of Israel. The Evangelical base within the Republican Party is very friendly to the nation of Israel.

The other reason is that there are many people in the Republican Party who view Ukraine as one of the villains of the Trump years. There are conspiracy theories on the right that blame, for example, Ukraine for the Russia investigation. So there is a level of hostility on the part of multiple MAGA Republicans against Ukraine, and that hostility does not exist with regards to Israel.

It’s also the case that there is sympathy for Vladimir Putin in parts of the right that does not exist for Hamas. So for example, prior to the Russian full-scale invasion in February of 2022, there were a number of members of the right who looked to Vladimir Putin as a kind of Christian nationalist opponent of wokeism. They saw him as a kind of masculine Christian figure opposing the weak woke West.

On one level, you would look at the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Hamas attack on Israel and you would say they’re not quite the same or not the same in many important ways. For example, Russia is the much more powerful nation on its own compared to Ukraine, whereas Israel is far more powerful than Hamas. But the Russian attack on Ukraine and the Hamas attack on Israel do share something very important in common, and that is the sheer brutality of the assault.

There are so many things we don’t know when the leadership of the House of Representatives is unknown. Look, what needs to happen now, quite simply — and I hate to be this blunt — is that House Republicans need to grow up. This is a key point in world history, not just American history.

There is conflict flaring in the Middle East. We don’t know right now if it could spread to northern Israel and Hezbollah or even to Iran. There is an offensive unfolding — a Russian offensive unfolding in Eastern Europe. And the Republicans vacated the chair, they tossed out their House Speaker for no good reason at all.

And so here we are without a Speaker, the House crippled in its ability to do business, and the same arsonists who set the initial fire are continuing to burn the building. And there’s no end in sight at the moment."

A key update comes Thursday at noon Eastern, with Jay Powell, the Fed chair, set to speak at the Economic Club of New York. Wall Street will be tuning in for Powell’s outlook on interest rates and for clues about the level that might be needed to nudge inflation closer to the Fed’s target of 2 percent.

In recent months, inflation has begun to ease, but the path has been bumpy as hiring remains robust and consumers continue to spend.

That’s fueled fears in the bond markets that Fed policymakers will keep their prime lending rate at around 5 percent well into next year. The conviction has prompted a mammoth sell-off in Treasuries in recent weeks, pushing the yield on the 10-year note to a 16-year high."

It sounds counterintuitive, and to be sure, large numbers of parents support the idea of reducing class sizes. But my colleague Troy Closson, who covers education in the city, says that what would usually be a selling point for a school system is already leading to a backlash in some neighborhoods, with others likely to follow. I asked him to explain."
482,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/business/media/hospital-blast-gaza-reports.html,"The shifting coverage about a deadly explosion at a hospital in Gaza highlighted the difficulties of reporting on a fast-moving war in which few journalists remain on the ground while claims fly freely on social media.

The first reports of a strike at the Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City came early Tuesday afternoon Eastern time. A spokeswoman for the Gaza health ministry said an Israeli airstrike had caused the explosion, killing at least 200 people. In a televised interview, a health ministry spokesman later said the death toll exceeded 500 — which the ministry later changed to “hundreds.”

The news changed quickly over a couple of hours. Many Western news organizations, including The New York Times, reported the Gazan claims in prominent headlines and articles. They adjusted the coverage after the Israeli military issued a statement urging “caution” about the Gazan allegation. The news organizations then reported the Israeli military’s assertion that the blast was the result of a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group aligned with Hamas.

On Wednesday, American officials agreed with Israel, saying early intelligence indicated that the launch did not come from Israel and instead was caused by the armed Palestinian group. Most of the coverage about the blast on Wednesday focused on the U.S. analysis."
483,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostages-gaza-invasion.html,"Ms. Zin has spent the days since the attacks desperately seeking information about the girls while juggling media interviews and meetings with the military official who is assigned to provide her with updates and check on her well-being. The official confirmed her daughters had been kidnapped but had no other details about them, Ms. Zin said. She has since learned that her ex-husband, his partner and her son had been killed in the attacks.

Ms. Zin is pressing for the return of her daughters, and all other hostages, by any means necessary. “I demand it from my country,” she said.

“I am not a woman with money; I don’t have property,” Ms. Zin added. “I have my two daughters. That’s it. That’s all I have. It’s for them that I wake up in the morning. And now, I don’t have my daughters.”

Avichai Broduch, a 42-year-old farmer from Kibbutz Kfar Azza, is also waiting for the return of hostages: his wife, Hagar, and their three children, Ofri, 10; Yuval, 8; and Uriah, 4.

He is unsure what a ground invasion of Gaza would accomplish. “It simply won’t help,” Mr. Broduch said, adding that it could work if it were done to “restore peace.”"
484,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/world/middleeast/protest-israel-hamas-ceasefire-congress.html,"Hundreds of demonstrators descended on a congressional building in Washington on Wednesday afternoon to demand a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, resulting in an estimated 300 arrests and restricting access to Capitol Hill.

The rally was organized by two progressive Jewish groups, Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow, and about 400 of their members assembled inside the rotunda of the Cannon House Office Building, led by about 25 rabbis reading testimonials from Palestinians in Gaza and reciting prayers. Outside, hundreds more chanted, “Cease-fire now” and sang in Hebrew and English.

Demonstrations are not permitted in congressional buildings. About 300 protesters were arrested, organizers estimated, though the Capitol Police would not comment on the number beyond saying on the social media platform X that three were charged with assault on a police officer. Protesters were restrained with zip ties and led into police vans.

Linda Holtzman, a rabbi from Philadelphia, said she was protesting because of her faith, values and Jewish history, a theme other attendees echoed. Rabbi Holtzman, who said she was concerned about violence intensifying against civilians in Gaza, said that her grandmother survived the Holocaust and that she was taught to fight for all human life.

“Where there is no justice, I have to be a voice for justice,” she said."
485,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/world/middleeast/protests-gaza-hospital-israel-palestine.html,"They donned the black-and-white checkered Palestinian scarf known as the kaffiyeh in Tunis, unfurled giant Palestinian flags in downtown Cairo and chanted against Israeli occupation in the normally sleepy Oman capital of Muscat. In Morocco and Bahrain, they demanded a reversal of their government’s normalization with Israel, the country they consider responsible for oppressing their Palestinian brethren.

In Lebanon, they pushed toward the United States Embassy, denouncing the superpower as an enabler of Israel’s brutality toward civilians in the Gaza Strip. In Istanbul, 80,000 people massed outside the Israeli Consulate, including some who attempted to storm the building with stones, sticks, torches and fireworks.

Thousands of protesters marched in grief, fury and solidarity across the Middle East on Tuesday night and Wednesday, after hundreds of Palestinian civilians were killed in an explosion at a hospital in Gaza. Although Israel and the United States said the evidence pointed to a faulty rocket fired by Islamic Jihad, a Palestinian militant group, there was little doubt for those protesters that Israel was to blame — and not just for the hospital deaths, but for the broader conflict as well.

“What is happening is an extermination,” said Khaled Mhamdi, 27, a content creator who was among the thousands who gathered outside the French Embassy in Tunis on Wednesday. “The whole world should do something to stop it.”

The carnage at Al Ahli Arab Hospital, the site of the blast in Gaza on Tuesday, unified not only Arabs in the street but also the leaders they tend to regard with weary distrust. Some Arabs have berated their governments as failing to stand up to Israel in the past, but now those governments have nearly uniformly condemned Israel for the attack. The leaders of Jordan and Egypt canceled a meeting with President Biden after the hospital explosion, apparently unwilling to stomach being seen with the leader of Israel’s staunchest supporter as images of bloodied children at the hospital were ricocheting around Arab social media.

The widespread criticism made for a striking convergence: For once, many Arab publics long frustrated with their leaders over a wide range of issues appeared to be more or less on the same page as their governments."

488,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/world/middleeast/gaza-hospital-israel-hamas-explained.html,"Hundreds of people were feared dead after an explosion at a hospital in the Gaza Strip on Oct. 17, a little over a week after the Palestinian group Hamas staged a terrorist attack on Israel that killed 1,400 people and led Israel to declare war and begin bombing the territory.

Hamas, which controls Gaza, blamed the blast on an Israeli airstrike.

Israel said it was caused by an errant rocket fired by another armed group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which denied the assertion.

And on Wednesday, President Biden backed Israel’s position, citing “the data I was shown by my Defense Department.”

The competing claims have not been independently verified. The New York Times is working to assess the various accounts through an analysis of photos, video footage and other evidence, as well as on-the-ground interviews.

Here is what we know so far about the explosion at the Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City.

What do we know about the death toll?

American intelligence agencies have assessed that between 100 and 300 people were killed, U.S. officials said Thursday. The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, did not say what intelligence led them to that estimate, and cautioned that it could change.

On the night of the explosion, the Hamas-run Gazan health ministry put the toll at 500 or more dead, which it later changed to “hundreds.” No figure could be confirmed independently, but images from the hospital verified by The Times and witness accounts made clear that it was high.

Mohammad Abu Selim, the head of the nearby Shifa Hospital, said in an interview hours after the blast that 150 to 200 people killed in the explosion were taken to his hospital, along with about 300 people who had been wounded. He said he had no official tally of the dead because of the terrible condition of many of the bodies.

The next morning, the Israeli military said the number of casualties reported by Hamas was inflated, citing intelligence without elaborating. The Gazan health ministry said later on Wednesday that 471 people had been killed and hundreds more injured. Those figures could not be independently confirmed.

The hospital is run by the Anglican Church and overseen by Archbishop Hosam Naoum, who said that in recent days, large numbers of Gazans had taken shelter there to escape Israeli airstrikes. The hospital usually has 80 beds, according to the diocese website.

What did the United States government say?

Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said Wednesday that the U.S. government “assesses that Israel was not responsible for an explosion that killed hundreds of civilians yesterday at the Al Ahli Hospital in the Gaza Strip.”

“Our assessment is based on available reporting, including intelligence, missile activity and open-source video and images of the incident,” she said, adding that the United States was continuing to collect information.

Ms. Watson said the intelligence indicated that some Palestinian fighters in the Gaza Strip believed the explosion had likely been caused by an errant rocket or missile launch carried out by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. “The militants were still investigating what had happened. We continue to work to corroborate whether the explosion resulted from a failed P.I.J. rocket,” she said.

American officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information, said that multiple strands of early intelligence, including infrared satellite data, show a launch of a rocket or missile from Palestinian fighter positions within Gaza. They cautioned that the analysis was preliminary.

A senior Defense Department official said that, based on data collected by infrared sensors, the United States was “fairly confident” the launch did not come from Israeli forces.

What did Palestinian Islamic Jihad say?

Palestinian Islamic Jihad, whose members participated in the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, denied that an errant rocket from its arsenal had caused the explosion.

In an interview with The Times on Wednesday, a spokesman for the group, Musab Al-Breim, said that the capacity of their weapons supply was “primitive.”

In a statement on Tuesday, the group said video footage and the extent of the destruction showed that the blast was caused by an Israeli aerial bombardment.

The group’s military wing posted a message on Telegram at 7:09 p.m. on the night of the explosion saying it had fired a barrage of rockets toward Israel — just minutes after the blast occurred.

But the spokesman said the timing of posts did not always indicate the timing of launches.

He acknowledged that errant rockets from the military wing had killed Palestinians in the past. “We have made mistakes, I am not going to deny it,” he said. “However, not mistakes of this size.”

What did the Israeli army say?

Citing aerial footage, photos taken in the aftermath of the explosion and recordings it said were of Hamas members, the Israeli military said on Wednesday that the blast was caused by a rocket that misfired after being launched by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, said the Palestinian group fired 10 rockets at 6:59 p.m. on the night of the explosion, and that one of them fell to earth prematurely, hitting a parking lot outside the hospital.

He denied that Israel had fired any ordnance in the area of the hospital at that time.

He cited a photo of the parking lot that was posted on social media on Wednesday morning that he said did not show the kind of crater that would have been caused by an Israeli missile. The photo shows the effects of a fire — burned-out cars and scorched ground — that he said was caused by rocket fuel.

He also showed an aerial image that he said was taken from a military drone overnight and said there was no evidence in it of such a crater either. (U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that there was only light structural damage to buildings and no impact craters at the hospital, U.S. officials said.)

A freelance videographer working for The Times who visited the scene the day after the explosion filmed footage showing a small impact crater. Other images show the same, including the Israeli military’s aerial photo. It is still unclear whether the crater is related to the explosion and if any conclusions can be drawn from it.

Admiral Hagari dismissed suggestions that the strike was caused by an errant Israeli air defense interceptor; he said Israel does not fire air defense missiles into Gazan airspace.

The admiral played a recording of what he said was a wiretapped conversation between two Hamas members, in which one speaker says the damage was caused by a rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad from a cemetery near the hospital. The Times is assessing the material and has not verified the conversation.

What did Hamas say?

In a statement, Hamas said the explosion was “a horrific massacre” and “a crime of genocide” caused by an Israeli airstrike.

The Ahli Arab Hospital had been hit previously by rocket fire on Oct. 14, according to the Gazan health ministry and video footage verified by The Times. The Anglican Church said in a statement that four staff members were injured in that blast.

Yousef Abu al-Rish, the top official for the Gazan health ministry, said at a news conference on Tuesday night that the Israeli military had called the hospital director and told him that the earlier blast had been a warning to evacuate.

On Wednesday, Archbishop Naoum said that the Israeli military had called and texted the hospital managers at least three times since Oct. 14, asking its patients and staff to leave the hospital compound.

Archbishop Naoum said the warnings were particular to the hospital, and not part of Israel’s wider push to encourage civilians to leave northern Gaza for the territory’s south.

“There were specific warnings to get out of the building,” the archbishop said.

Lt. Col. Amnon Shefler, an Israeli military spokesman, said the calls to the hospital were part of a wider campaign to urge civilians to leave northern Gaza ahead of an expected Israeli invasion. Colonel Shefler said the hospital was not a target for the military.

489,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/world/middleeast/gaza-rafah-border-crossing-egypt.html,"After Israel imposed a complete siege of the Gaza Strip in response to the deadly Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, the strip’s border crossing with Egypt became even more critical, as the only point not controlled by Israel where aid has come in and some people have been allowed out.

In typical times, the access point is alive with commercial traffic and people traveling to and from Gaza. But for two weeks after the war began, nothing passed through the crossing, which is near the southern Gazan city of Rafah, as diplomatic talks to allow people and supplies to pass were hammered out. Amid deteriorating conditions in Gaza and Israel’s persistent bombardment of the enclave, Israeli strikes have hit the crossing at least four times.

Since the border opened on Oct. 21 after negotiations between Egypt, Israel, the United States and the United Nations, aid trucks have started trickling in, though aid officials say that supplies have met only a small fraction of Gaza’s need for food, water and medicine.

On Wednesday, some foreign nationals and severely wounded Palestinians began leaving Gaza through the Rafah border crossing, the first time people were allowed to pass from Gaza to Egypt since the full siege began."
490,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-rafah-border-crossing.html,"Israel said Wednesday it would not block aid to Gaza from Egypt, and there were already long lines of trucks parked in Egypt, at the Rafah border crossing, waiting to carry food, water and fuel to the enclave.

Israel has insisted that all trucks be checked to ensure they are carrying only aid and that the aid reaches civilians, not Hamas fighters. Egypt has supported humanitarian aid to Gaza, but has not yet said if or when it will allow the border crossing to open.

Egypt’s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, said Tuesday in an interview with CNN that the crossing had been seriously damaged by recent Israeli airstrikes and that it wanted Israel to guarantee safe passage for aid convoys before it would let the trucks through.

Opening the Rafah crossing to aid, and keeping it open, will be fraught because of the high level of mistrust between Israel, Hamas and Egypt, and the ever-present potential for violent flare-ups.

But aid is there, and more is on the way. The European Union paid for a cargo planeload that arrived at the small airport of El Arish on the northeastern coast of Egypt, near the Rafah crossing, on Tuesday. Another plane with E.U.-funded aid will depart Copenhagen for the same airport on Thursday.

But European and U.S. officials said the Egyptian authorities have not allowed their diplomats to access the area, not even to inspect the aid their governments have sent. The lack of access reflects Egypt’s desire for tight control of the region, which is in a province where Egypt has fought militants for years. Egypt fears the Gaza conflict could spill over, sparking unrest and perhaps more militant activity within its own borders.

In the meantime, 106 trucks loaded with aid from local charities have been lined up outside the gate at Rafah, awaiting the opening of the crossing. An additional 58 trucks with aid were delivered to the Egyptian Red Crescent in the city of Arish early Wednesday.

Storage facilities of the Egyptian Red Crescent were overflowing with humanitarian aid supplies, and the El Arish football stadium, which is storing aid sent from other countries and international humanitarian organizations, has also reached maximum capacity, a senior member of the Egyptian Red Crescent said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.

Shortly after President Biden announced, and Israel confirmed, on Tuesday that aid into Gaza would not be blocked, the convoys still sat silent and there were no signs of activity."
491,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/world/middleeast/gaza-hospital-deaths-aftermath.html,"The Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, which runs the Ahli hospital, said that the hospital administration had received at least three warnings from the Israeli military to evacuate its wards on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. The Archbishop of the Diocese, Rev. Hosam Naoum, said the warnings were issued by phone call and text message directly to their administration and were separate from the general warnings given to the more than one million residents of the northern Gaza Strip.

The Israeli military acknowledged that it did call the hospital in recent days, but it said it was part of a wider effort to encourage residents and community leaders in northern Gaza to flee southward — signaling that a ground invasion was coming. The call was not to warn of a specific strike on the hospital, said Lt. Col. Amnon Shefler, a military spokesman. The hospital “was not in any way a target,” he added.

After the first warning, the hospital staff notified the 5,000 or so people sheltering there. Most left and only about 200 remained, Archbishop Naoum said. But the next day, many returned, having found no safer place as airstrikes pounded the city.

“Every time there’s bombing, every time there’s an airstrike, people flee to the hospital,” Archbishop Naoum said. “This is a sanctuary for them.”

The warnings didn’t dissuade Sameh and his family from seeking refuge there. They had joined the thousands of people who fled their homes elsewhere in Gaza City to take shelter amid 11 days of Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

Israel’s intense bombardment of Gaza began on Oct. 7 in response to a surprise attack by Hamas that killed roughly 1,400 people in Israel. Since then, Gazans have found that nowhere is safe, as homes, mosques, schools and hospitals have been struck. More than 3,500 Palestinians have been killed since the strikes began, according to the Gaza health ministry.

On Saturday, two Israeli projectiles hit the same hospital that was struck on Tuesday night, damaging the fourth floor, which housed a diagnostic center and the ultrasound and mammography units, the hospital administration said. However, the Israeli military denied that it had struck that area on Saturday.

Sameh said he and his family fled their home in Gaza City fearing that it could be in danger from Israeli rockets, and went to stay with an aunt. But then they grew concerned that her home was under threat as well, so they came to the hospital.

There, he found many other displaced Gazans staying in the courtyard, library and church.

“We felt it was safe, and we said it would be safe for the little kids,” he said from his hospital bed.

But Tuesday night, the courtyard where just hours earlier children were enjoying the hospital playground along with hospital staff became a scene of carnage.

“There are still lots of bodies they haven’t yet collected,” said Amir Ahmed, a paramedic with the Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza City. “There are too many bodies.” He said all the victims would be buried in a mass grave at a funeral on Wednesday.

“There is a big possibility that they will just put a number” on the body bags without any names, Mr. Ahmed added, “because many are in pieces.”"
492,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/business/media/children-israel-war-tiktok-instagram.html,"“In times of conflict, where misinformation and disinformation run rampant, it becomes even more critical to safeguard young people from the potential emotional impact of such material, and provide the support necessary to process and contextualize this type of content,” Isabelle Frances-Wright, an author of the report, said in an emailed statement.

Meta, which owns Instagram, addressed its efforts to balance safety and speech in a blog post about the war on Friday. It noted that it established a special operations center with expert monitors working in Hebrew and Arabic, who removed or flagged more than 795,000 pieces of harmful content in the first three days of the conflict. The company also said that Instagram allows users to control how much sensitive content they are recommended.

In its own blog post last weekend, TikTok said it had also opened a command center and added more Arabic- and Hebrew-speaking moderators, removing more than 500,000 videos and closing 8,000 livestreams since Hamas’s attack on Oct. 7. The platform said it was automatically detecting and removing graphic and violent content, placing opt-in screens over disturbing images and adding restrictions to its livestreaming function amid the hostage situation.

Snapchat’s parent company, Snap, said in a statement that it was “continuing to rigorously monitor” the platform and “determining any additional measures needed to mitigate harmful content.” The platform does not have an open newsfeed or livestreaming abilities, which limits harmful content from going viral, the company said.

Amid a flood of posts about the war, some schools have urged parents to delete their children’s online accounts to shield them from Hamas’s attempts at psychological warfare. (Hamas accounts have been blocked by platforms like Instagram and TikTok but remain active on Telegram.) The chief executive of the parental app BrightCanary told USA Today that online searches for hostages among users between 9 and 13 years old surged 2,800 percent in recent days."

President Biden landed in Israel on Wednesday for a high-wire diplomatic mission that is facing new challenges by the minute. A deadly blast on Tuesday at a Gaza hospital left Israelis and Palestinians trading blame, and led Jordan to cancel a meeting with Biden and Arab leaders meant to help tamp down tensions in the region.

All that threatens to become what investors have feared: a rapid escalation of violence that could roil markets, upsetting a fragile global economy. Adding to the tension: Iran on Wednesday called for members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to impose an oil embargo on Israel.

The latest developments: Biden met with Benjamin Netanyahu in a show of support for efforts to eliminate Hamas; aides have said that Biden would ask the Israeli prime minister “tough questions” about the country’s airstrikes on an expected ground invasion of Gaza. Before departing for Israel, Biden said he was “outraged and deeply saddened” by the blast at Ahli Arab Hospital. Palestinians blamed an Israeli airstrike, and Israelis cited an errant rocket fired by an armed Palestinian faction. Neither side’s account could be independently verified, and the cause of the blast and its death toll remained unclear.

The chances of fighting breaking out across more of the Middle East are growing. Israeli forces are clashing with Iranian-backed Hezbollah forces based in southern Lebanon."
494,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/world/asia/putin-xi-china-russia.html,"The leaders of China and Russia hailed each other as “old” and “dear” friends. They took swipes at the United States and depicted themselves as building a “fairer, multipolar world.” And they marveled at their countries’ “deepening” trust.

China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, used a Beijing-led conference of leaders from mostly developing countries on Wednesday to showcase his ambitions to reshape the global order, as the world grapples with a war in Ukraine and a crisis in Gaza. He cast his country as an alternative to the leadership of the United States. And he gave a prominent role to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, underscoring how central their relationship is to Mr. Xi’s vision.

The event, the Belt and Road Forum, is centered on China’s signature foreign policy initiative, which aims to expand Beijing’s influence abroad with infrastructure projects. Mr. Putin was treated as the guest of honor and often pictured by Mr. Xi’s side. The two leaders also met for three hours in Beijing on Wednesday.

While Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi huddled, President Biden landed in Israel on a visit aimed at preventing the war between Israel and Hamas from spreading. Though Mr. Xi did not publicly remark on the war, Mr. Putin, at a news briefing, blamed the United States for increasing tensions in the Middle East by sending warships to the region. He said that such regional conflicts were “shared threats that only strengthen Russo-Chinese relations.”"

496,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/opinion/netanyahu-israel-gaza.html,"“How could this happen?” we asked one another, neighbors in pajamas suddenly gathered in the not quite safety of the stairwell of our Jerusalem apartment building. Our first air-raid siren of the new war had just sounded. It was early on a holiday morning; I’d heard no news. In a jittery loud voice, a man from across the hall told us about the Hamas invasion of Israel that had just begun.

That moment repeats on a loop in my mind — when I wake up at night and when the sirens repeat. A century has passed since then and no time at all. The news comes in jagged pieces that one’s mind cannot fit together: The rave in the countryside where Hamas men hunted down and slaughtered young Israelis. Hamas’s taking grandmothers and young children as hostages and butchering families. And our army, on which we relied, in disarray, taking three days to regain control of the area bordering Gaza. More than a week later, the unfathomable counting of bodies and attempting to identify them continues. “How did this happen?” echoes in every conversation. The reflexive answer is that Hamas is barbaric — and that it opposes not only the occupation but our very existence here.

This is true — and insufficient. For an Israeli, the real heart of the question is: Who allowed this to happen? Despite the agony, because of it, we must demand a national accounting for what made the military disaster possible: the hubris and complacency and, most of all, the delusions of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government.

Mr. Netanyahu has been prime minister for 13 of the past 14 years. While the head of the Shin Bet security service and the commander of military intelligence have publicly taken responsibility, the prime minister has glaringly failed to do so. But if the army and the country were unprepared for the Hamas invasion — as they clearly were — there is no place else for the buck to stop."
497,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/opinion/frankfurt-palestine-war-israel.html,"Last week the literary association Litprom canceled a celebration for the Palestinian author Adania Shibli’s book “Minor Detail” at the Frankfurt Book Fair, one of the publishing world’s biggest international book fairs. The novel, which was a finalist for the National Book Award and was longlisted for the International Booker Prize, was to be honored for having won the 2023 LiBeraturpreis, a German literary prize awarded annually to a woman from the developing world. A panel that Shibli, who splits her time between Jerusalem and Berlin, was to be on with her German translator, Günther Orth, was likewise canceled.

In a statement defending the decision, Juergen Boos, the director of the book fair, distanced the organization from the award, saying the prize came from another group, which was now looking for “a suitable format and setting” to honor Shibli elsewhere. He also said that “we strongly condemn Hamas’s barbaric terror war against Israel” and that the fair “has always been about humanity; its focus has always been on peaceful and democratic discourse.” Furthermore, Boos said, the Frankfurt Book Fair “stands with complete solidarity on the side of Israel.”

Some readers, like the festival organizers, may also side entirely with Israel, which was brutally attacked by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7. Others may side with Hamas or with the Palestinian people, now under fire by Israeli forces. Still others may have more complicated positions, condemning the actions of Hamas while supporting the establishment of a democratic Palestinian state or supporting Israel while disapproving of the tactics of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government or its military.

But taking a side in a war does not require taking positions on a work of fiction — no matter the subject matter or the author’s nationality — and that is the effect of the fair organizers’ decision. Canceling a celebration of an author may not be the same thing as banning a book, but the organizers’ decision amounts to demonizing a fiction writer and stifling her viewpoint."

Hamas, the group that controls Gaza, said an Israeli airstrike had caused the blast at the Ahli Arab Hospital. Hours later, Israeli officials said that one of the rockets fired at Israel by Palestinian militants had failed shortly after launch, causing what could be the deadliest single incident of the 10-day-old war.

Photos and videos posted online and verified by The New York Times showed bloodied and battered bodies, flames, grieving witnesses and the blankets, backpacks and mattresses of the dead and wounded littering the area around them. Ali Jadallah, a Palestinian photojournalist in Gaza City, said he watched as victims arrived at another hospital, ferried there in any available vehicle, most of them dead. Many of the bodies were not intact, he said.

A woman shared a video she recorded as she made her way through the hospital, asking, “Where am I supposed to go?”"

Yet posts supporting the group that carried out terrorist attacks in Israel this month are still reaching mass audiences on social networks, spreading gruesome footage and political messages to millions of people.

Several accounts sympathetic to Hamas have gained hundreds of thousands of followers across social platforms since the war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7, according to a review by The New York Times.

One account on Telegram, the popular messaging app that has little moderation, reached more than 1.3 million followers this week, up from about 340,000 before the attacks. That account, Gaza Now, is aligned with Hamas, according to the Atlantic Council, a research group focused on international relations.

“We’ve seen Hamas content on Telegram, like bodycam footage of terrorists shooting at Israeli soldiers,” said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League. “We’ve seen images not just on Telegram but on the other platforms of bloodied and dead soldiers.”"

Virtually all stressed the horrific nature of the devastation. But governments across the Middle East took up the Gazan health authorities’ claim of an Israeli airstrike, rejecting the Israeli military’s later assertion that a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad was to blame.

Some of those governments, including that of Iran, said the United States and other countries supporting Israel were also to blame. “The U.S. is responsible for the recent crimes,” Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said bluntly in a speech on Tuesday.

The catastrophe, at Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, came hours before President Biden boarded Air Force One for Israel, and it threatened to draw the United States further into a conflict it has sought with increasing urgency to keep from expanding into a regional war."
502,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/opinion/israel-gaza-invasion-mistake.html,"That military operation against Hezbollah was seen as a success — so punishing that it bought 17 years of relative quiet. But it also nurtured resentments that could help turn an invasion of Gaza into a wider regional war. This past March, Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, told a group of Iran-backed militia members to get ready for a war with Israel that would begin a new era and include a ground invasion, according to a report by The Times. Over the weekend, Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, warned that attacks on Gazan civilians would trigger a reaction from Hezbollah, which has the military capability to cause a “huge earthquake” in Israel.

Hamas appears to want to lure Israelis into Gaza and has been preparing for this battle for years.

“This looks to me like a group that has come to believe its own narrative that Israel is a paper tiger and that it can defeat them militarily,” said Thanassis Cambanis, the director of the Century Foundation's international research and policy center, who studies Islamist groups.

Israel’s military is not a paper tiger; it is one of the most technologically sophisticated militaries in the world. But it seems to be repeating the same mistakes the United States made after Sept. 11. Acting out of grief, rage and no small amount of hubris, America waged two costly wars, with deadly consequences for Iraqi and Afghan civilians and poor outcomes for ourselves in the end. Those wars empowered one enemy, Iran, and created a new one, ISIS. And after maintaining an over-20-year insurgency in Afghanistan, the Taliban is back in power, proving that “dismantling” a terrorist organization is easier said than done. American overreach squandered the good will we’d gotten in the wake of the attack.

By cutting off power, food and other essential goods to more than two million people in Gaza — until Hamas releases the hostages that are being held, Israel’s energy minister, Israel Katz, said — Israel is opening itself up to charges of collective punishment, which is illegal under international law. Nearly half of Gazans are under the age of 18. Why should they pay the price for Hamas’s attacks?

Over the summer, thousands of Palestinians staged protest marches in Gaza against Hamas’s rule. Hamas security beat them with batons. “They don’t even pretend to care about us,” one demonstrator told al-Monitor, an online news site. Now those same protesters are losing their homes, and possibly their lives, to Israeli bombs. Without power, many Gazans will lose the ability to pump water from wells or treat the wounded in hospitals. They are already losing contact with the outside world as their cellphones die. So they won’t be able to receive the evacuation warnings that Israel sends."

The hospital is in the southern part of Gaza City and has long operated amid conflict, contending with border clashes and financial and practical obstacles arising from the political situation. But since the war between Israel and Hamas began following the deaths of more than 1,400 people in Israel during Hamas’s Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, the institution has found itself in the middle of a military operation and under fire.

On Saturday, rocket fire injured four staff members, according to the hospital, prompting the Most Rev. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, to call for the reversal of Israel’s order for Palestinians to evacuate from the north of Gaza ahead of a planned ground offensive. “Hospitals and patients in Gaza are in grave danger,” he warned, adding that “they are facing catastrophe.”

After the blast on Tuesday, the archbishop said, “I mourn with our brothers and sisters — please pray for them,” in a post on X, formerly Twitter."

An explosion killed hundreds of people yesterday at Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City that was packed with thousands of civilians sheltering there, Palestinian officials said.

Palestinian authorities said the blast was caused by an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli military said a misfired Palestinian militant rocket, not an Israeli strike, was responsible for the deadly explosion. The health ministry in Gaza said it expected the death toll to rise.

The incident compounded an escalating humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, as President Biden was expected to arrive in Israel today. Even before the hospital explosion, rescuers were struggling to free more than a thousand people trapped under rubble, and fights were breaking out over loaves of bread.

Israel said yesterday that it had intensified its bombing in the southern Gaza cities of Khan Younis and Rafah. Israel’s bombing campaign has killed 2,800 people and wounded 10,000 others, according to Palestinian officials, and Israel’s orders to evacuate northern Gaza have displaced at least 600,000, according to the United Nations."
505,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/opinion/biden-israel-leadership.html,"That the massacres were “pure, unadulterated evil.” That there is “no excuse” for what Hamas did. That Israel has an affirmative “duty” to defend itself, not simply a passive “right.” That the United States will make good on its commitment to a Jewish state not with feeble statements of solidarity but with the surge of military force. A few days later, in an interview with “60 Minutes,” he called the assault “barbarism that is as consequential as the Holocaust.”

We need political leaders who maintain the capacity to call out barbarism by name and who commit themselves to its defeat. We need it especially on the political left, certain corners of which waited only a few days before returning to their usual program of denouncing Israel for its alleged or anticipated war crimes. These are the same people who sometimes pretend to believe in Israel’s right to self-defense but offer no plausible strategy for how Israel can exercise it against a terrorist enemy that hides behind civilians.

We also need Biden’s leadership given the moral void on the right. I spent the years of Donald Trump’s presidency being hectored by a certain type of Jewish conservative who insisted that Israel had never had a better friend in the White House. Today, Trump takes a dimmer view of Netanyahu — less because of his failed performance than because he can’t forgive the prime minister for calling Biden in 2020 to congratulate him on his victory. Four days after the Hamas attacks, Trump also called Hezbollah, without reprobation, “very smart.” About Vladimir Putin, he said, “I got along with him very good.”

Very good. Very smart. The Republican front-runner.

Now Biden is going to Israel. It’s a brave trip, even for a president with his vast security apparatus, given that Hamas’s rockets continue to fall indiscriminately on Israel and a second front with Hezbollah could open at any time. He is going, almost surely, to do what he does best: console the bereaved and bereft, give courage to those in fear. This is statesmanship in the teeth of far-left opposition and incessant right-wing criticism. It’s the president’s finest hour.

I have seen some criticism that the hidden purpose of the trip is for Biden to hug Israel close so that he can stay its hand, or at least slow it. I doubt it, since he could hardly have been clearer in his “60 Minutes” interview that Hamas would have to be eliminated entirely, even as there needed to be a path to a Palestinian state. That path is a long one, but Biden gets the big thing right — the former is the basic precondition for the latter. No Israeli leader can ever allow a Palestinian state to exist if a group like Hamas has even the whisper of a chance of gaining power."

And a grim question hung over the enclave on Tuesday: Was there anywhere safe to go?

Last week, after the deadly Oct. 7 cross-border attacks by Hamas, Israel ordered all of Gaza’s northern residents — some 1.1 million people — to abandon their homes ahead of an expected ground invasion of the strip and to head south. Hundreds of thousands obeyed, leaving by car, motorcycle and even on foot.

But on Tuesday, Israel said it had intensified its bombing in the southern Gaza cities of Khan Younis and Rafah, just as the residential buildings there were swelling with new arrivals and as food, water, medicines and other supplies were running out.

Asked why Israel continued to strike in southern Gaza after ordering people to evacuate there, Maj. Nir Dinar, an Israeli military spokesman, said that Israel sought to avoid civilian casualties but that members of Hamas were hiding out among Gazan civilians. He added that southern Gaza was relatively safer than the north, but not entirely safe."

The men’s soccer team, with players from four continents and seven countries, spent the first week of hostilities grappling with their duties as students and athletes amid a flare of heightened emotions.

When news of the attacks broke, the Maccabees, a school nickname derived from the leaders of an ancient Jewish rebel army, were in the middle of a good season. Loaded with talented players from Argentina, Brazil, France, Italy, South Africa, New Jersey, Long Island and Israel, the Macs had a 5-1-2 record in the Skyline Conference, a Division III league made up of New York teams. After losing in the final last year, the Maccabees are bent on winning this year, and earning the school’s first invitation to the N.C.A.A. tournament.

When they met last Monday for practice, Alan Weiss, their first-year head coach, who is also Jewish, addressed the players. He asked how they were faring, and tried to ascertain if they were still capable of dividing their attention between their concerns for loved ones and soccer.

The overriding sentiment was a desire to play on.

“The mood was very serious,” Mr. Weiss said. “It is hanging over everyone. We recognized it, we said prayers, and then we got to work.”"

Israeli and U.S. commandos have pulled off extraordinary hostage rescues before. But the chaotic environment of Gaza, which is descending into a humanitarian crisis and the base where Hamas launched devastating attacks on Israel this month, has made such a mission unlikely because of the dangers to hostages and soldiers alike.

That has left desperate, complex diplomacy — led by the United States and Qatar, a tiny nation with extensive ties to militant groups — as the best option to save hostages in the eyes of many current and former officials.

In the talks so far, Qatar is acting as a mediator between Hamas and officials from the United States, which like Israel and the European Union considers Hamas a terrorist group. Adding even more complexity to the talks, people from more than 40 countries are among the hostages."

The troops are currently stationed in the United States and other locations, including Europe, Pentagon officials said. If deployed, they would likely not serve in combat roles, the officials said.

Sabrina Singh, a Defense Department spokeswoman, said on Tuesday that the Pentagon had determined it needed to ready additional air defense, security, logistics, medical and intelligence specialists, but it had not yet identified specific units to increase their preparedness.

The Pentagon said in a statement that while a decision on whether to deploy the forces had not been made, Mr. Austin’s order to increase their readiness helps the Pentagon’s “ability to respond quickly to the evolving security environment in the Middle East.”"

What they found shocked them. Hamas members were using Ms. Idan’s Facebook account to livestream themselves holding her and her family hostage. During the 43-minute broadcast, gunmen forced Ms. Idan and her family to crouch on a tile floor as missiles and gunfire blasted their building.

“I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,” said Keren de Via, a friend of the Idan family who watched Ms. Idan’s children hug their parents and cry during the livestream. “How could we watch them terrorize the family like this? How could I watch this on Facebook?”

512,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/opinion/israelis-palestinians-torah-humanity.html,"Some two million Palestinian people are trapped inside Gaza, nearly half of them under the age of 18. Most of them are hungry. Bombs have already turned their cities into rubble. More than a million people have been asked to leave their homes.

In the Mishneh Torah, Maimonides teaches, “When a siege is placed around a city to conquer it, it should not be surrounded on all four sides, only on three. A place should be left for the inhabitants to flee, to escape with their lives.” Egypt and the international community, with cooperation from Hamas and Israel, must open the southern Gaza border now. Not just for internationals but also for Palestinians. We must insist that this happens.

We are all temporary dwellers wherever we live. The Torah teaches that land doesn’t belong to people; it belongs to God or to the earth or both, depending on your perspective. The land needs to be shared. That has not changed. Both peoples have a legitimate claim and a real history in the land. Both peoples deserve safety, freedom, self-determination and peace. That has not changed. Any agenda that promotes a future or present where one people rules over the other is inhumane and immoral. Any agenda that promotes a future for just one people on the land, either Palestinian or Israeli, is inhumane and immoral.

Right now the left is using an outdated, ill-fitting model of colonialism to explain what’s happening in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. It borrows from antisemitic tropes, leading to a cruel and dehumanizing view of Israelis and Jews. Colonizers do not have thousands of years of history in the land they colonize, as Jews do in Israel, and colonizers do have a home country they can be decolonized to. For those who callously called Oct. 7 a step toward decolonization, I ask that they consider: Where are the Jews who fled from Iraq supposed to go? And those who fled from Iran? And those from Yemen? And those from Russia? And those from Ethiopia? And how about the Jews who came from Europe after surviving the Holocaust? They were dispossessed of their land, their homes, their belongings, just as their ancestors were dispossessed by the Romans in the first two centuries of the common era and by the Babylonians before them.

This does not in any way justify the dispossession of Palestinians from their land and homes and belongings, but it is a fact. Here we are, two peoples, stuck together. There is no way forward without recognition of that reality."

Mr. Abu Amar, a minibus driver, has an Israeli ID card but is not an Israeli citizen. On the night of Oct. 6, he picked up a group of partygoers in Jerusalem and took them to a rave festival near the Gaza border. He stayed overnight, intending to drive them back in the morning.

Hamas fighters and supporters broke through Israeli defenses early the next day, carrying out a series of attacks on Israeli soldiers and killing more than 1,000 civilians in Israel.

514,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/opinion/social-media-israel-palestine.html,"When institutions offered statements that expressed sorrow for the loss of both Israeli and Palestinian lives, some constituents and customers demanded a revision that explicitly condemned their preferred villain. If these institutional voices stayed silent, it was considered newsworthy. “Six days after Hamas’s horrific terror attacks on Israel,” a reporter at Women’s Wear Daily wrote last Thursday, “many major players in the beauty — and overall fashion — industry have remained largely silent in support of the victims on both sides of the conflict.” Did we really need or want to hear from L’Oréal or LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton?

The impulse toward loud, reductive declarations reflects genuine fear about horrors that lie beyond words. Simple binaries imply simple solutions. And it’s much more pleasant to tell yourself you stand on the side of good, against evil, than to question whether the lines of demarcation were drawn correctly.

Sitting with uncertainty is hard, especially when social media has primed us to expect perfect real-time information during traumatic events and to want instantaneous answers and resolution. Moral certainty is an anchor we cling to when factual certainty is not possible. And the faster we express it, the more certain we appear. The most righteous among us post — and do it immediately.

Knee-jerk social media posts are not what bother me most, though. Instead, it’s the idea that not posting is wrong somehow — that everyone needs to speak, all the time. It discourages shutting up and listening and letting the voices that matter the most be heard over the din. It implies it’s not OK to have any uncertainty about what’s going on or any kind of moral analysis that does not lend itself to presentation in a social media post. It does not leave time or space for people to process traumatic events in the sanctuary of their own minds or to gather more information before pronouncing a judgment. It pressures people who don’t have an opinion yet or are working out what they think to manufacture one and present it to a jury of total strangers on the internet who will render an instant verdict on its propriety.

I do have opinions, of course, but they don’t fit in a tweet (and would be extremely awkward on TikTok). I think Hamas is a terrorist group and Israel has a right to defend itself. I lived in Manhattan on Sept. 11, and even so, I can’t imagine the grief and terror Jewish people feel right now in the face of continued attacks and rising antisemitism globally. I also think that the Israeli state should not be allowed to conflate Hamas with Gaza or to cut off electricity and access to food and medical supplies to civilians who are trapped in Gaza or to justify those acts by claiming that Palestinians who live there — about half of whom are children — can just leave when they plainly can’t. If the destruction of Gaza is not the goal, it is a very real possibility, and that should be equally unacceptable."
515,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/opinion/israel-hamas-universities.html,"As a bioethicist, I support requiring students to take ethics classes. Some universities — mainly Catholic institutions, including Georgetown — still do. Having a two-course ethics requirement — one about general ethics and one about some specific area, such as military ethics, environmental and bioethics, ethics of technology, ethics of the market or political ethics — would be invaluable.

But ethics classes alone are insufficient to help students develop a clear moral compass so that they can rise above ideological catchphrases and wrestle intelligently with moral dilemmas.

Instead, colleges and universities need to be more self-critical and rethink what it means for students to be educated. For the past 50 years, with a few exceptions, higher education has been reducing requirements. At the same time, academia has become more hesitant: We often avoid challenging our students, avoid putting hard questions to them, avoid forcing them to articulate and justify their opinions. All opinions are equally valid, we argue. We are fearful of offending them.

This flies in the face of what a liberal education should be. Liberal education should be built around honing critical thinking skills and moral and logical reasoning so students can emerge as engaged citizens. The American Association of Colleges and Universities has described a liberal education as one that “empowers individuals with core knowledge and transferable skills and cultivates social responsibility and a strong sense of ethics and values.” This certainly is not the full vision, but even with this definition, it is very hard to recognize that what we are now offering as a college education meets even this standard.

There are many ways to construct a curriculum so we can certify graduates as educated. Starting in 1947, as a new era dawned after what it identified as “social upheaval and the disasters of war,” M.I.T. undertook a review of its curriculum, re-examined the almost 90-year-old principles that had guided its approach and imposed changes that emphasized the importance of the humanities and social sciences. The review committee saw among M.I.T.’s missions the preparation of each student “for the moral and ethical burden relating not only to his own acts but to the acts of which he is a part” and the “cultivation of the spirit of free inquiry and rejection of interdiction and prejudice.”"
516,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/business/dealbook/saudi-davos-desert-conference-ceos.html,"Some executives are worried about the optics, pointing to an initial statement from Riyadh about the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks that appeared to blame Israel. The diplomatic normalization talks with Israel appear to be on hold, and the crown prince has reportedly begun talks with the Iranian government about preventing the conflict from metastasizing.

Meanwhile, Riyadh has been cool to U.S. efforts to restore calm and preserve progress made in the Saudi-Israeli talks. Prince Mohammed reportedly made Secretary of State Antony Blinken wait hours before meeting, and then called for a halt in the “current escalation” of the conflict.

“The headlines emerging from the region at this moment are not quite constructive,” Ayham Kamel, the head of the Eurasia Group’s Middle East and North Africa research team, told DealBook.

But attending may not be as fraught as in years past. A slew of top executives withdrew from the conference in 2018 after the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents. But the stigma of going has since lessened, amid Prince Mohammed’s public calls to modernize his kingdom’s economy and talk of normalizing relations with Israel. The kingdom’s billion-dollar economic diplomacy initiatives are also a big draw.

Many executives plan to go, for now. Some have suggested that attending would help encourage Saudi Arabia in its modernization push. And so far only two of some 5,000 attendees have dropped out, according to Reuters."
517,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-gaza.html,"To be sure, Mr. Netanyahu has not hesitated to target Hamas when its rockets have rained on Israeli towns and villages. In 2014, he ordered a more limited ground operation into the Gaza Strip, which enhanced his reputation domestically as a protector, even as it subjected Israel to international criticism for an operation that, for all its limited nature, still killed an estimated 2,251 Palestinians in 50 days of fighting.

Mr. Netanyahu’s reluctance to go even further, these observers said, is rooted in both his risk aversion — a trait that has also influenced his go-slow approach to peace talks with the Palestinians — and his military training. Like most young Israelis, Mr. Netanyahu enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces after high school. He served in a special forces unit that carried out cross-border raids.

In a tragedy that looms large in the Netanyahu family lore, his older brother, Yonatan, was the only Israeli soldier killed in the Entebbe raid, a much-celebrated counterterrorism operation to rescue hostages on an Air France jet that had been hijacked by Palestinian militants and diverted to Libya, and later Uganda, in 1976.

Those experiences, analysts said, imbued Mr. Netanyahu with a bias for tactical strikes over large-scale army operations. That has translated into a calculation that, with periodic bombardments of Gaza — a strategy some have called “mowing the grass” — Israel could keep a lid on Hamas’s destructive capacity, as well as Palestinian tensions, without having to find a lasting political solution."

It is something we tried to warn against — creating an atmosphere of dehumanization that puts our community at risk, creates sitting ducks. And it pains me that the sacrificial lamb to this atmosphere was this beautiful, young 6-year-old boy who had his whole life ahead of him.” “We received some calls. They said we’ve been exaggerating. Now, I want to ask anybody here, a 71-year-old man sitting on top of a 6-year-old kid, stabbing him more than 26 times — and he was looking in his eyes. You tell me: Is that exaggeration? You tell me what type of man he can do that.”"
519,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/opinion/israel-palestine-mass-death.html,"In Gaza, mass death has already begun. Last week the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, announced that Israel was cutting off Gaza’s water, electricity, food and fuel. There was hopeful reporting over the weekend that at the urging of President Biden’s administration, water to a town in Gaza’s south had been turned back on, but for many, drinking water is still unavailable. The Associated Press reported on Sunday that clean water has run out in U.N. shelters across Gaza. On Saturday, UNICEF reported that, according to local sources, more than 700 children in Gaza had been killed. The number by now is surely higher.

Some readers, I suspect, will respond that while this is all terrible, it is also all Hamas’s fault. In many ways, I agree. Hamas’s terror is clearly the immediate cause of the hell raining down on Gaza; most countries attacked as Israel was attacked would respond with war. That does not, however, license Israeli indifference, or worse, to the lives of civilians. Israelis have a right to their rage; I imagine that if I were Israeli, I would share it. But incitement against Palestinians, the overwhelming majority of whom have nothing to do with Hamas terrorism, is leading us toward somewhere even darker than where we are right now.

Influential voices in America are intensifying the bloodthirsty atmosphere. Appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” the Republican senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas dismissed worries that mass civilian casualties in Gaza will work to Hamas’s advantage on the world stage. “As far as I’m concerned, Israel can bounce the rubble in Gaza,” he said. That phrase, “bounce the rubble,” is a reference to a Winston Churchill quote about apocalyptic military overkill. To Cotton’s right, the language is even more incendiary. “If it comes down to ethnic cleansing — you want to cleanse my people, I’ll cleanse yours first,” said Joel Pollak, a senior editor at large at Breitbart News, on the webcast of the leading young conservative Charlie Kirk.

We can already see where the total dehumanization of Palestinians leads. This weekend, a 6-year-old boy in Illinois was allegedly stabbed to death by his landlord, who is also accused of gravely injuring the boy’s mother. According to the local sheriff’s office, the victims were targeted “due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis.”

If this is the atmosphere in parts of the United States, it is exponentially more fevered in Israel. On Monday morning I spoke to Diana Buttu, a Canadian Palestinian lawyer in Haifa who once served as a legal adviser for the Palestine Liberation Organization. “I can understand what my grandmother felt in 1948 when she fled” from a town near Nazareth, Buttu said. “Because it’s a climate of total fear that you’re next. And this isn’t just in the Gaza Strip; it’s also spread to the West Bank.” Already, according to Al Jazeera, at least 55 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed, some by soldiers and others by settlers. Haaretz reported that five Palestinians were shot dead by settlers in the village of Qusra. A message to the village on WhatsApp said, “We have no red lines. We’ll punish you in order to make an example out of you.”"
520,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/us/politics/blinken-us-israel-gaza.html,"Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken hurried into a bunker as air raid sirens wailed in Tel Aviv on Monday, in the most dramatic moment of a whirlwind — and unusually chaotic — Middle East tour for America’s top diplomat.

After his second visit to Israel in five days, Mr. Blinken was scheduled to land in Amman, Jordan, on Monday night, but he ended up stuck in a marathon overnight negotiation session in Tel Aviv, and his next destination was uncertain. A trip originally scheduled for two days has now extended into its sixth, with 10 stops and counting.

For an official whose travel schedule is meticulously planned and rarely revised, Mr. Blinken’s frenetic journey has underscored the scale and complexity of the diplomatic crisis he faces.

Mr. Blinken is at once trying to show U.S. support for Israel after it was attacked by Hamas on Oct. 7; limit Arab criticism of Israel’s military response; win the freedom of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza; and prevent an escalation of the conflict, perhaps to include Hezbollah and Iran, that might draw in the United States."
521,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/world/asia/putin-china-xi.html,"When President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia meets with China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, during a visit to Beijing this week, both men will likely seek to demonstrate the strength of their “no limits” partnership in challenging the Western-dominated global order.

The visit comes at a time of turmoil in the Middle East after Hamas’s attack on Israel this month, which has led to Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and expectations of a ground invasion. Both Russia and China have refrained from following the lead of Western countries by condemning Hamas directly.

Instead, the two countries have called for an end to the violence and a revival of talks about a Palestinian state. China’s foreign minister this weekend accused Israel of going too far in its reprisals in Gaza, echoing an earlier denunciation by Egypt. And Mr. Putin urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, during a phone call on Monday, to “avert a humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip.”

The Chinese and Russian alignment over the Israel-Hamas conflict reflects their geopolitical ambitions. Both countries have tried to cast themselves as leaders of the developing world, partly to bolster their standing with the oil-rich Arab world. They have also reinforced their own relationship over a common interest in eroding American global power."
522,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/opinion/gaza-invasion-hospital-tedros-who.html,"Al Shifa Hospital, the largest health care facility in the Gaza Strip, is emblematic of an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Already underresourced and overcrowded, it is now home to thousands of people who have sought refuge from Israeli airstrikes that rained down on their neighborhoods after the horrific and unjustified attacks by Hamas on Israeli civilians on Oct. 7.

Al Shifa Hospital has always been under tremendous strain. When I visited in 2018, I met with patients and health workers and toured a dialysis unit and a neonatal intensive care ward, full of newborns in incubators. Their tentative grasp on life was sustained by diesel generators that powered the hospital when the electricity went off, as it did for several hours every day. Staff members, patients and their families faced difficult choices to make daily.

These choices are now seemingly impossible in the fallout from Oct. 7 — not just at Al Shifa Hospital but at northern Gaza’s other hospitals and clinics as well.

With no electricity and fuel running out in Gaza, within days hospital generators will fall silent, and the incubators, dialysis machines and other lifesaving medical equipment will shut down. Many of the most critically ill patients, including babies, whose lives have only just begun, will probably die. Attempting to move them is equally hazardous. Water scarcity is a grave concern for struggling patients, especially newborns."
523,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/world/europe/france-teacher-attack-hamas.html,"The terrorist attack by Hamas in Israel and the retaliatory strikes in Gaza had already put the French authorities on edge, pushing them to jack up security at Jewish sites and ban pro-Palestinian protests.

Then, last Friday, just three days before the country was set to mark the somber anniversary of a teacher’s gruesome beheading by an Islamist extremist, an eerily similar attack hit at home as a man used a knife to kill a teacher and injure three other people at a school in northern France in what officials called an Islamist terrorist attack.

Since then, the mood in France has gone from worried to alarmed. The authorities raised the terrorist threat alert to its highest level, pouring even more police officers and soldiers onto the streets. Bomb scares emptied out major sites over the weekend, including the Louvre and, twice in less than a week, Versailles Palace.

Officers in flak jackets with machine guns, their fingers resting on the triggers, stood sentinel on Saturday outside the school where a former student went on a stabbing spree the day before, killing Dominique Bernard, 57, a French literature teacher."

Meta, which owns the two social networks, said that some of those posts were hidden from view because of an accidental bug in the company’s systems. In particular, messages of support for Palestinian civilians, many of whom have been displaced, injured or killed by Israeli airstrikes, were being hidden from the platforms, users said. Some people have also reported that Facebook suppressed accounts that called for peaceful protests in cities around the United States, including planned sit-ins in the San Francisco Bay Area over the weekend.

Aya Omar, an artificial intelligence engineer, told The New York Times that she was unable to see Palestinian media accounts she regularly reads because Meta and Instagram were blocking those accounts. She said that people were seeing a sanitized version of the events occurring in Gaza.

“Instagram and Facebook are actively blocking posts about the factual history of Israel/Palestine, sometimes cloaking it as ‘technical difficulty,’” the Hampton Institute, a think tank, said Sunday in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter."

It was hardly a promise, though. A weekend of diplomatic talks to open the Egyptian-Gazan border has so far yielded little but confusion, even at the embassy. Its email about the border opening did not cite talks with Egypt or Israel — it was based on news reports.

The lack of clarity was clear on the ground. Scores of people on Monday toted suitcases and garbage bags stuffed with what personal belongings they could carry to the only border crossing into Egypt, only to find the gates on the Gaza side closed and themselves stuck waiting on floundering diplomatic efforts.

“Are we never getting out of here???” Lena Beseiso, 57, an American stuck near the crossing, in the city of Rafah, wrote in a text message to a reporter. It was the second time in the past seven days that she and her family had gone to the border in hopes of escaping ahead of a threatened Israeli invasion of Gaza."

She was at the rave party on Oct. 7 where gunmen from the Hamas militant group massacred hundreds of young people and kidnapped many others. She called as the gunmen closed in.

“Dad, they saw me, dad, they saw me, dad, they saw meeeee.”

Then the line cuts.

These are the families experiencing the unbearable anguish of being in the middle of the world’s most complicated hostage crisis in recent memory. Babies, grandmothers and wounded Israeli soldiers. Americans, Filipinos, French and Mexicans. Scores of people have been abducted from that rave party and from a ring of small towns and kibbutzim that heavily armed Hamas members besieged for hours before Israel’s security forces could respond.

On Monday, the number of publicly known hostages increased to almost 200, up from the 150 that had been spoken of since the beginning of the conflict. An Israeli military spokesman said that the military had “updated” the families of 199 hostages, but he did not say what they discussed.

Experts say that Hamas has most likely locked them up in a warren of underground tunnels in the Gaza Strip, as the Israeli Air Force bombards the territory and the army prepares to invade. It’s not clear to anyone how Israel is going to launch a full-scale invasion of Gaza without putting the hostages at greater risk."

The boy inside, a Lego-loving, 6-year-old soccer fan named Wadea Al-Fayoume, was too young to have understood the complicated politics of the place his Palestinian parents left behind, or of this country where he was being raised. But, the authorities in suburban Chicago said, he became a casualty of those divisions nonetheless.

Wadea, who should have been at school on Monday, was instead mourned by an enormous crowd that filled the large mosque in Bridgeview, Ill., and spilled outside. Prosecutors said that he was stabbed to death over the weekend in an attack motivated by hate for Muslims amid the fighting in Israel and Gaza. A short drive away from the mosque, Wadea’s 71-year-old landlord, who was charged in his killing, was making his initial appearance in court.

Family members and friends remembered Wadea as a kind child who loved swimming, jumping and playing games, and celebrated his birthday only days ago.

The babies, Nuha and Fatin, were born prematurely and need formula. But there is no water to prepare it at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, a city buckling under the pressure of new arrivals, as half a million people in the Gaza Strip have fled their homes in anticipation of an Israeli ground invasion.

Less than a week ago, the babies’ mother, Nahla Abu Elouf, 26, was seven months pregnant and hospitalized at Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. Her blood pressure had dropped and the babies’ heartbeats became irregular as Israel began launching heavy airstrikes on the city in response to a cross-border assault by Hamas fighters. Nahla Abu Elouf’s sister is Samar Abu Elouf, a freelance photographer who has covered Gaza for The New York Times since 2021.

Al Shifa, the largest medical complex in the Gaza Strip, was quickly inundated after the start of the strikes. Many of those entering the hospital were wounded, covered in dust and blood; others were desperate for a safer place to stay; still others were already dead, and their bodies had to be placed on the sidewalk outside the overwhelmed morgue."

sabrina tavernise

From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise, and this is “The Daily.” Last week, we told the story of Golan, a father of four whose kibbutz was attacked by Hamas terrorists. It was an attack that killed 1,300 Israelis and prompted Israel’s government to say it will now destroy Hamas, which governs Gaza and its 2 million residents. Now, we turn to what’s happened inside Gaza in the days since that attack. Israel has prohibited food, water, and electricity from entering the territory and has bombarded it with airstrikes that have killed more than 2,600 Palestinians. Late last week, the situation grew more dire when Israel ordered people in the north of Gaza, nearly 1/2 the population, to evacuate to the south ahead of an expected Israeli ground invasion. Many in Gaza now fear that this mass expulsion will become permanent, reopening the trauma of Israel’s creation in 1948, which displaced more than 700,000 Palestinians. Today, conversations with two people in Gaza about what they’ve experienced so far and what they expect comes next. It’s Monday, October 16.

abdallah hasaneen

Hello.

sabrina tavernise

Hi, is this Abdallah?

abdallah hasaneen

Yeah.

sabrina tavernise

Hi, Abdallah. My name is Sabrina Tavernise. I spoke to Abdallah Hasaneen on Thursday. He’s 23 years old and lives in southern Gaza, in a town called Rafah. At that point, people there had endured six straight days of airstrikes.

abdallah hasaneen

Basically, I don’t know if I’m going to be alive for the next hours or no. My neighbors who are living just two blocks away from my house are evacuating at this moment, as they have received a threat that their whole building is going to be bombed within the few minutes. So basically, it’s a three-story building or four-story building. But when one building is threatened to be bombed, the whole block has to evacuate. Because it’s a mass destruction to the whole area. So the whole block that is next to my home is evacuating at this moment as I’m talking to you.

sabrina tavernise

The whole block next to your home is being evacuated right now? Are you seeing that out your window?

abdallah hasaneen

I’m just seeing people running. And actually, there’s no light, as the electricity is cut off since yesterday. And I have already been facing difficulty just connecting to a stable internet connection to make this call with you.

sabrina tavernise

Where in the house am I reaching you right now? Where is safest?

abdallah hasaneen

Um, I don’t know where’s safest. There is no safest. I’m just standing here in the balcony just to make this call. No place is safe enough in Gaza. You’re just seeing the options and which is somehow safer for you. And just the whole street is in darkness. And I’m just seeing people running everywhere to seek shelter at this moment.

sabrina tavernise

Abdallah, how are you feeling right now?

abdallah hasaneen

Just feeling terrified about my family. Most of them are children, actually. And I am the biggest one of them. I’m the biggest brother. And that’s it. I feel the responsibility to make them safe, despite the fact that there is no safe area in the Gaza Strip. I’m sure you can hear the noise from the neighbors just running. I don’t know if you can hear that.

sabrina tavernise

I hear the voices. What is — can you — what’s happening downstairs?

abdallah hasaneen

Actually, you’re just seeing people running at this moment, seeking shelter in other safer place that’s just away from the building that is threatened to be bombed. Whole people are just seeking shelter. [PEOPLE SHOUTING]

sabrina tavernise

I hear them.

abdallah hasaneen

Yeah, that’s what’s happening at this moment. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So actually, my neighbor is telling me to open all the windows and to stay away from them as they are going to bomb soon. I don’t know if you can hear him calling my name or not.

sabrina tavernise

And why was he saying that to you?

abdallah hasaneen

Because when the airstrike happens, if the windows are not open, they will break into your heads. So you have to open the windows. Because the strength of the bombing can break the windows, and you have to stay from them not to be injured from the glass.

sabrina tavernise

Do you need to go open the windows right now?

abdallah hasaneen

Actually, we have already done that since the beginning of this escalation against Gaza, because we know what would happen.

sabrina tavernise

Abdallah, do you have plans to evacuate with your family? What are you thinking right now in terms of what you want to try to do?

abdallah hasaneen

So evacuate to where? Where should we go? Because Gaza — because the Gaza Strip — OK, so let me tell you. In Gaza, we have no shelters. We have no safe places. [EXPLOSION] Can you hear this?

sabrina tavernise

I can hear it. I can hear it. What are you seeing? What is that?

abdallah hasaneen

It’s a rocket — it’s a damn airstrike that happens out of nowhere.

sabrina tavernise

Did it hit something?

abdallah hasaneen

Yeah. Yeah. But it’s not that close. I’ve just seen the red light, and the sound of aircraft is all over the place, the same as the sound of the drones that never stop. But yeah, the situation is getting worse by each hour passing. So I don’t know if I’m going to stay this night. In my heart, I would leave.

sabrina tavernise

Uh-huh. [CALL TO PRAYER IN BACKGROUND]

abdallah hasaneen

That’s a national prayer.

sabrina tavernise

That’s the call to prayer.

abdallah hasaneen

Yeah. [CALL TO PRAYER IN BACKGROUND]

sabrina tavernise

Do you need to pray? Are you going to pray?

abdallah hasaneen

I’m going to pray after we are done with this call. [CALL TO PRAYER IN BACKGROUND]

sabrina tavernise

What will you pray? What is your prayer?

abdallah hasaneen

It’s kind of a spiritual connection between us and god. And actually, that’s the only thing that helps us at this moment, as we are left. I believe that the people of Gaza are left alone. I’ll pray for my people to get what they want, to live in peace, because we deserve peace.

sabrina tavernise

So Abdallah, I wanted to ask you. We’ve been talking about all of the airstrikes that have been happening since last Saturday. And of course, the thing that happened last Saturday as well was this very deadly attack by Hamas on Israel. How do you understand that attack? What did you think of that?

abdallah hasaneen

OK. So it did not start, actually, by Hamas attack. Because we’ve been under siege for more than 70 years. And you cannot just put people into prison, deprive them from their fundamental rights, and then see nothing in response. You cannot dehumanize people and expect nothing.

sabrina tavernise

What do you think about Hamas, Abdallah — what it is, what it does?

abdallah hasaneen

Like, I am not Hamas, and I was never a big fan of Hamas. We both are different in the ideology. But what’s happening here is not about Hamas at all.

sabrina tavernise

What’s it about?

abdallah hasaneen

It’s about — it’s about ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people. It’s about 2.3 million of Palestinian people. That’s why Israel — the first thing that it did was cutting off water and cutting off electricity and cutting off food. So this is not — never about Hamas. It’s about our mistake to be born Palestinians. That’s it.

sabrina tavernise

Thank you for talking to us, Abdallah. And I wonder if I can call you back tomorrow. I want to keep in touch and make sure you’re OK. And if you can, send me a voice memo, OK? You hear something in the night, you send a voice memo.

abdallah hasaneen

OK.

archived recording 1 We start with breaking news on the Israel-Gaza war. archived recording 2 Last night, Israel told more than a million Palestinians in northern Gaza to move south, signaling a ground assault is likely coming. archived recording 3 And even if those people are able to move south, there is currently no way out of Gaza, because the border crossing into Egypt is blocked.

abdallah hasaneen

The order to evacuate the north of Gaza to the south of Gaza is just crazy. And it’s got to be a joke, because Israel wants to expel more Palestinians from their homes within 24 hours than it did during the whole Nakba of 1948. You are talking about more than 1.1 million of Palestinian people that have to evacuate within one day, within 24 hours? Like, are you serious? It’s got to be a joke. Those are real human beings. These are not just numbers. We are talking about human beings. This has to stop. The collective punishment that we are facing every minute has to stop. [PHONE RINGING] Hello?

sabrina tavernise

Abdallah?

abdallah hasaneen

Yeah. Hi, Sabrina.

sabrina tavernise

Hi. How are you doing?

abdallah hasaneen

Not good at all.

sabrina tavernise

What’s happening?

abdallah hasaneen

I’m just so devastated by the news I’m reading.

sabrina tavernise

Abdallah, it’s Friday night at about —

abdallah hasaneen

9:00.

sabrina tavernise

— 9:30 PM. What are you going to be doing tonight? What’s the next couple of hours look like for you?

abdallah hasaneen

So actually, we have my aunt and my cousins coming to our home. Because they are evacuating as well. So I will be spending the night with them. Actually, during escalations, this is something that most of people in Gaza do. They all gather in one room, and they stay together all the night, or they sleep together, in case that other building is the bomb, that they will die together.

sabrina tavernise

So that they’d die together.

abdallah hasaneen

Yeah.

sabrina tavernise

So tonight, you’ll sleep with your family together.

abdallah hasaneen

Yeah. That’s it. That’s what we do. Somehow, it consoles you that you have some company.

sabrina tavernise

It sounds very dark, Abdallah.

abdallah hasaneen

Yeah, that’s it. That’s the situation here. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back.

wafa elsaka

Hello?

sabrina tavernise

Hi, my name is Sabrina Tavernise. I’m a reporter from “The New York Times” and a host of “The Daily” podcast. What’s your name?

wafa elsaka

My name is Wafa Elsaka, and I’m from Florida. I was a teacher until March of this year. I was an art teacher at Hartsfield Elementary School, and I live in Tallahassee, Florida.

sabrina tavernise

I spoke with Wafa Elsaka on Saturday. She’s a Palestinian-American, and she’s one of the hundreds of thousands of people who’ve evacuated from the north of Gaza to the south over the last two days.

wafa elsaka

And I came to visit my family, because I have my mother-in-law, who’s really old. She’s 97 years old, bounded to bed. Came to visit her and take care of her. And I have a father who is really ill and sick on oxygen, 24/7. And I just wanted to spend some time with them before — you know, don’t know when I’ll see them again. And this has happened. I’m now — I don’t know. I was almost struck by a missile yesterday morning. I promised my sister-in-law I’ll take care of her mom. And while I was giving her the medicine on the bed, I saw a missile just passing by next to the room, hit the land right across from their house. Everything collapsing, like the windows, glass everywhere. So I threw myself on my mother-in-law to cover her from the debris. Because I was scared that she could get hit, you know.

sabrina tavernise

Where were you, Wafa?

wafa elsaka

In Gaza City, the heart of the Gaza City — Al-Rimal. Al-Rimal is in the north, right across from the saraya.

sabrina tavernise

Wafa, on Friday night, the Israeli military gave the order for everybody in northern Gaza to evacuate to the south. Did you get that order?

wafa elsaka

No, I didn’t. I heard it from my niece. And I’m like, no, this is just lying. This is propaganda. So in my mind, I kept trying to convince my sister-in-law and her daughter, no, this is not true. And then, she gets on her phone that, whatever, the General of Defense from Israel saying, clear it or else. And she’s — from previous wars that she’s seen, she said if he says something, he’ll do it. So they start frantically picking up stuff out of nowhere — water, food, this, that. And it’s like, we have to evacuate. We have to go. We have to go. Everybody — it went, like, at 6:00. It went, like — no, even 5:30. They start picking up all the water, because we bought a lot of water. Because there is no water in the city. Like, when you open the faucet, there is no water. And then, we got food like cheeses, and we got tons of bread from the bakery. It was a panic mode. And they said, wait until the daytime comes, because if the Israelis see that there is movement down the stairs and near the cars, they might hit us with the missiles. And I’m like, this is bullshit. No, don’t say that. No, I’m going to go take the stuff and load them in the car for you guys. And she goes, no, no, no, no! And she held me back, and I was like, please, please don’t go down. They will kill you. They will hit a missile on you.

sabrina tavernise

Huh. So your sister-in-law was worried that if you went downstairs and brought the food and supplies to the car, you could get hit with something from the Israeli side.

wafa elsaka

Yes, because they will see movement. And then I was panicking, and I said I can’t do panic, because I need to wait and think. I’m not going to go with them. The embassy already issued me evacuation very soon. And then they said, no, you have to come with us. I said, no, I’m not going to go. This is not safe. What are you guys doing?

sabrina tavernise

So Wafa, then what happened? Did you go with your relatives? What did you do?

wafa elsaka

No, they already left. So after about two hours, that missile hits. And it was just right across the street. It was just within a couple of feet of the house. It was like a huge sound, with a fire coming next to the window. The sound is unbearable. Like, if you ever heard the worst thunder ever, but it’s multiplied by hundreds of times of that sound. Like, it will make you deaf. And then, all debris all around me and dust and gas. There was a smelly smell. I can’t describe the smell yet. But it burned the throat and my nose and my eyes. I never, ever smelled something like it. And then my brother-in-law holds the neighbor next to it, and we took my mother-in-law down the stairs. And we got my nephew to come back with the car and evacuate us. And we came to Khan Yunis. And it was like cars after cars with people hanging from the side of the car. They’re holding to the windows. But from the outside, kids, like 10 years old and 8 years old, their parents — their mother holding their hands inside the car, and they’re hanging from outside the car, because the car is loaded with 10, 15, and stuff in there.

sabrina tavernise

10 people in a car?

wafa elsaka

More. There are some of them with more. I’m telling you, people were hanging out. Some people opening the trunk of the car and having kids inside the trunk with the trunk open.

sabrina tavernise

Kids inside the trunk.

wafa elsaka

I even saw those construction — I lost the — in English. You know the one moves the robot?

sabrina tavernise

Like a bulldozer, like a digger?

wafa elsaka

Yes. And having mattresses in there, and they’re having people sitting on the mattress in the bulldozer, holding them.

sabrina tavernise

Oh, my god. So kids were actually hanging on from the outside of cars, hanging on to people from the inside of the car. The trunks were open. People were stuffed into the trunks.

wafa elsaka

I promise you, yes. I didn’t have the heart to take pictures. I wish I did, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t, because I was in disbelief. My heart was aching. (CRYING) I felt like my heart is broken to see my city. This is unreal. [YELLING] Oh, my god! A missile.

sabrina tavernise

Wafa?

wafa elsaka

(CRYING) It was a red ... It was a red light on top of their house. We don’t know where it hit.

[sobbing]

It went — it went like a sunshine, and then it dropped.

sabrina tavernise

What does that mean?

wafa elsaka

There was a missile hit close by. But it felt like it was in here, but I could see a sun coming over and then went down.

sabrina tavernise

Wafa, you were on the road. What happened once you got to Khan Yunis? Did you know anybody there to go into their house? What happened?

wafa elsaka

No. I’ve never been to this house before, but my husband’s niece — it’s her — the uncle of her husband, you know.

sabrina tavernise

Yeah.

wafa elsaka

So it’s like a faraway relationship.

sabrina tavernise

Yeah.

wafa elsaka

I never met them before. So we — [SHOUTING]: [EXPLOSION] That’s another sunshine came over. [YELLING] And — and there is another one. And the smell — I can’t describe the smell. It’s like — like matches.

sabrina tavernise

Like sulfur?

wafa elsaka

Like matches, but very strong, very strong, comes to your throat.

sabrina tavernise

Yeah. It’s like it burns the back of your throat, that sulfur taste.

wafa elsaka

And your eyes and the nose.

sabrina tavernise

Does the house shake? What does it feel like?

wafa elsaka

Yes, like it’s a little earthquake.

sabrina tavernise

A little earthquake.

wafa elsaka

Yes.

sabrina tavernise

Wafa, so you came to this house, where you’ve never been before. Have you met the owners? Are they feeding you? What’s happening in the house?

wafa elsaka

We brought in lots of food, and they have some, too. But then you didn’t feel like eating when you’re seeing all this pain. But we have kids, and we have to feed them, and they’re so crying all day long. They’re crying. They’ve been asking their parents, they want to go home. They are tired of this.

sabrina tavernise

How many kids are you with?

wafa elsaka

We have about 10, 10 little kids. But we have about 70 people in here.

sabrina tavernise

70? Seven-zero?

wafa elsaka

Don’t scare me, oh my god. Another one. Another miss — another one.

sabrina tavernise

So what happened? You arrived to the house. You were staying with —

wafa elsaka

Yes, I came in here. I stayed, and then I felt uncomfortable, since I don’t know them. So I called a friend of mine. And she has — her cousin lives in Khan Yunis. So I went there with them, which was yesterday, Friday. We ate little sandwiches of cheese and za’atar and a cup of tea. And then I said, I haven’t slept for a week, so they gave me a mattress on one of the rooms. And I slept. I actually went into a deep sleep. And 5:15 almost, a huge earthquake sound with things coming through the window, and then screams of these young little girls coming out of their mattresses like popcorn, freaking out. What the hell is this? Did I go to hell or something? I jumped out and started grabbing those girls, who are 15 and 13, freaking out, shaking. And I’m like, we’re OK, we’re OK, we’re OK. What happened is, they hit a missile three houses away from the house I stayed at, in the middle of the town of Khan Yunis. But they hit it with no warning, with people inside! So the men who were staying with us — they rushed to help with the people, because they said there were tons of people, over 30-plus people in there. They found the older lady. They picked her up. She came in so dusty, full of dust everywhere. She can’t breathe. So they start washing her face. They were describing that there were little girls, dead, everywhere. And there was, next to the house, like, a store for weddings. So they start grabbing from those wedding dresses and party dresses and covering their bodies. Oh, my god, another one! [EXPLOSION] Another one. It feels like the sun comes so fast and goes down, you know, but with the noise and the smell.

sabrina tavernise

sabrina tavernise

Yeah.

wafa elsaka

You could hear it, right?

sabrina tavernise

wafa elsaka

To cover the girls.

sabrina tavernise

What was happening there?

wafa elsaka

To cover the girls who are dead, because their bodies are showing.

sabrina tavernise

Oh, god.

wafa elsaka

And they went and they found body parts, the legs of kids and arms and body parts all over the place.

sabrina tavernise

But Wafa, just remind me here. You’re in the south at the south of the line, right? This was the place you were told to evacuate, and you’re getting hit.

wafa elsaka

And this is a safer place, supposedly, for us.

sabrina tavernise

How is your mother-in-law? Is she still there with you?

wafa elsaka

She’s with us right here, but she’s not doing well. Every movement, like, you just try to touch her hair, she screams. You move her arms, she screams. We’re all scared that we’re going to lose her at any time. And we don’t have hospitals to take her to. We don’t have any place to — we’re just trying to make her comfortable, and we don’t even have enough medication to do so.

sabrina tavernise

Where is your father and where is your husband?

wafa elsaka

My husband is in Tallahassee, Florida, with my other son. I have two boys. My grandson is crying every day, telling me, please, grandma, come back. (CRYING) And I keep promising him I’ll be there. It’s breaking my heart that I came in here and left him behind. So. [CRYING] My father is in his house, refused to evacuate. Because he said with the oxygen and his health and with the dust and the bombing, he said, I can’t. And if I die, then that’s the end of it. (CRYING) So my two brothers would not leave him alone and stayed with him. And my mom left with my sister-in-law somewhere here in Khan Yunis, that I don’t know even the address or I don’t even know where she is.

sabrina tavernise

Is he in the north, your father, or is he in the south with you in —

wafa elsaka

No, he’s still in the north side. [YELLING]

sabrina tavernise

Oh, no.

wafa elsaka

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. [SABRINA TAVERNISE GASPS] Another one. [LOUD THUD] No, I lived in the States for a long time, for over 35 years. And now, I retired, so I kind of try to come back and spend some time with them, because I lost a lot of time with them. (CRYING) So I’m trying to make up for it, and kind of take care of them. I don’t know. I’m so tired of this. Why we can’t see our family calmly and kindly, without being hurt. My sister lost her house and her two kids’ houses, all three houses lost. And she’s somewhere with some people. I don’t even know where. My mother evacuated with my sister-in-law into Khan Yunis. My dad cannot leave, because he has the oxygen tank, and he’s in our house in Al-Rimal. So I don’t know. And we are in some people’s house I don’t even know. (CRYING) Like, I have to stay with them. And my mother-in-law is crying. She wants to go back to her bed, but we can’t take her back. So I don’t know. I don’t know what else to do. Everybody’s everywhere. I don’t know. I don’t know. Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness. Another one.

sabrina tavernise

Oh! Wafa, what do you think will happen?

wafa elsaka

What I think will happen?

sabrina tavernise

Yes.

wafa elsaka

I think a lot of killing. We lived in 1948. And all we’re asking is to have peace to raise our kids. You already took our land. You already took our homes. You already took our grandparents and parents, and lots of killing happened. Why are we repeating history again? For what? What do they want? They want Gaza? What are they going to do with us? What are they going to do with the people? I want this question to be answered so we know. They want to throw us to the sea? Go ahead. Do it. Don’t keep us — don’t keep us in pain. Just do it! But they’re cutting the electricity. They’re limiting the food that’s coming in. They’re limiting the gas. They’re limiting medication. They’re limiting everything. Everything is controlled by them. They’re limiting blood coming in, for god’s sake. Before, I used to say Gaza is an open prison. Now, I say Gaza is an open grave. It’s a grave. You think people are alive? They are zombies. They are not alive. They are not alive. Not just because they’re walking, talking, that means they are alive. No, they are not. They’re all traumatized. They’re all traumatized. I’m traumatized. And I know how to heal myself, trying to. But I can’t heal my heart anymore after this war. My heart is broken to the bones. [MUSIC PLAYING]

For the seven years leading up to his attacks on Monday night, which have been described as “terrorism” by the Belgian authorities, the man had left a trail of criminal activity and ample signs that he was radicalized, including reported suspicious behavior and prolific online posts on social media.

His case was finally to be addressed by the authorities in a meeting that had been scheduled for Tuesday. It was too late.

The Belgian attack was the second in a week in Europe, following the killing of a teacher in France, by extremists well known to authorities that have highlighted the failures of complicated and bureaucratic systems put in place after a wave of terrorism in 2015 and 2016. That system is now coming under renewed scrutiny as the authorities and citizens worry about a possible reawakening of radicalism in Europe because of the war in the Middle East."

Combined with the four squadrons of F/A-18 jets aboard each of the two carriers, the United States will have an aerial armada of more than 100 attack planes, according to military officials.

The Pentagon has also sent a small team of Special Operations forces to Israel to assist with intelligence and planning to help locate and rescue the hostages held by Hamas, who are believed to include some Americans.

Israel has historically resisted foreign ground troops participating in operations on its territory, and White House officials have said they are not contemplating any action on the ground by American forces. But if Hezbollah opens a major assault, the United States could come to Israel’s aid by using naval and air units to bombard the militia in Lebanon.

“Moving the two carriers into the region sends a very strong signal,” Gen. Frank McKenzie, the retired commander of the U.S. Central Command, said on “Face the Nation.” “There is ample historical evidence that Iran respects the flow of combat forces into the theater. It does affect their decision calculus. And as Iran’s decision calculus is affected, so is Lebanese Hezbollah’s calculus affected.”

Still, an Iranian close to the government said the U.S. diplomatic messages sent through intermediaries indicated that the United States had no intention to get into a war with Iran and that the warships were meant for moral support of Israel. That may suggest a difference in interpretation. American officials said they do not want war with Iran but were explicitly sending the military forces to deter Tehran with the option of using them if provoked."

Diplomats from the U.S., Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries were locked in frantic talks yesterday to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Clashes along Israel’s border with Lebanon and Israeli airstrikes inside Syria stoked fears of a wider conflict in the region.

Israel’s new emergency wartime government held its first formal meeting amid a total breakdown of trust between the citizens and the state, which appeared to be preparing for the invasion. “We will take Hamas apart,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, according to a statement.

Yesterday, Israel’s military offered residents of Gaza a three-hour midday window to leave via a main highway, but Gaza’s Health Ministry refused to evacuate hospitals.

“There is nowhere in Gaza that can accept the number of patients in our intensive care unit or neonatal intensive care unit or even the operating rooms,” said Dr. Muhammad Abu Salima, the director of Al Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest medical complex."

Nearly one million people are grappling with shortages of food, clean water and shelter in Gaza, which is bracing for a land invasion by Israel in retaliation for the Oct. 7 attacks and the taking of hostages by Hamas, an Iran-backed militant group.

Mr. DeSantis argued on Sunday that it would be detrimental to the United States to “import” large numbers of refugees and would fuel antisemitism, echoing comments he made about people in Gaza the day before that drew scrutiny.

At a campaign event on Saturday, Mr. DeSantis said, “If you look at how they behave, not all of them are Hamas, but they are all antisemitic. None of them believe in Israel’s right to exist.”

He added: “The Arab states should be taking them. If you have refugees, you don’t fly people in and take them into the United States of America.”"

The assault on Saturday came amid mounting violence between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls the Gaza Strip. On Oct. 7, Hamas launched a surprise attack against Israel that left more than 1,300 Israelis dead, prompting intense retaliation that has killed 2,670 people in Gaza, according to officials in Gaza. Across the Middle East, fears of a widening conflict and worsening humanitarian crisis are mounting.

Suburban Chicago has a large Palestinian American community, including an area with many Arab restaurants and shops that some refer to as Little Palestine. The attack happened in a different part of the Chicago suburbs, in a home along a busy stretch of highway near a Chevrolet dealership and a barbecue restaurant. That property, about 40 miles southwest of downtown Chicago, was adorned with several American flags, an advertisement for organic honey and a sign asking people to pray to end abortion.

Mariola Jagodzinski, who lives two houses away, said she had never had any negative interactions with the suspect. She said she had given toys to the mother of Wadea, the 6-year-old, and was speechless and distressed when she heard about the killing.

“He was a playful child — really full of energy,” Ms. Jagodzinski said. “Kids are innocent. This really destroys so many hearts.”"

Her daughter Pnina Shalvi-Vega confirmed the death.

Dr. Shalvi developed a brand of feminist activism that drew on her experiences as a mother and a teacher, along with her deep knowledge of Jewish text, to help galvanize the nascent women’s movement in Israel beginning in the mid-1970s.

She was best known for her leadership of Pelech, an experimental school in Jerusalem that provides an egalitarian secular and religious education for Orthodox girls, and for her work as the founding director of the Israel Women’s Network. The network, formed in 1984, lobbies the government to reform Israeli laws treating women differently from men — in the military, marriage, employment and the administration of health care.

A diminutive woman who retained the accent and bearing of her European childhood, Dr. Shalvi was showered with accolades and awards recognizing her contributions to education, scholarship, religious life and civil society.

We’re kind of used to being bombed every few months. But this time, we understood really fast that it’s something else. We got in the shelter room and we have four kids. After that, we started getting messages from people crying to help. There were three people in my house, one young woman and two men. They started to try to open the door handle. There is no lock on the door on the safe room. It’s supposed to shelter us from bombs, not people. And my husband held the handle and me and the four kids and the dog were hiding in a corner. They were in my house eating. They watched TV. They watched a show on Netflix. They knew we were inside, and for 12 hours, we sat and waited for them to get in and kill us all. The kids were so quiet. They were so afraid. They were whispering, “Mom, I’m afraid.” “Mom, I’m hungry.” “Mom, what are the bad guys doing here? Why do they want to kill us?” And I told my husband, “If you can’t hold on anymore,” I told him, “Take your weapon and shoot us in the head. Make it quick.” They gave us seven minutes to pack our stuff. They took us to safety, took us out of the apartment. We took a shirt and put it on my kids’ faces because I didn’t know. I didn’t want them to see bodies lying, and the kibbutz burned, and people they know lying in the streets. I live in Nir Oz my whole life and it was my worst nightmare that terrorist people will go in the kibbutz. But in my worst nightmares, I never imagined it can be so bad, and so cruel, and so humiliating. They wrote Arab notes on the walls, and it was like, “We own the place, not you.” My kids keep telling me, “Ma, where is Safta? How can we leave the kibbutz without Safta?” And, “Where’s Jhoni, and Tamari, and Omer?” And I need to keep on telling them that I don’t know, even though I do know. I knew my dad is dead. I knew he died. I was talking to him on WhatsApp, and when he didn’t answer, he told me his last words are going to be, “Give a hug to the kids. We’re fine. It’s going to be OK. It’s going to be over soon.”"

And that community knows that there is no way through the fight without sorrow, confusion and terrible heartbreak.

American veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan know both the necessity of confronting a force like Hamas, which President Biden called “pure evil,” and the horrifying choices that decision entails. And we know that discussions of law and tactics — as important as they are — provide only partial answers. There is no way to escape the moral challenge of war.

As a former JAG (or Judge Advocate General’s Corps) officer embedded with a combat arms unit in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom, I know that you can’t simply merge law and tactics and declare that everything that is legally and tactically sound is also moral, much less wise. We veterans know that the challenge for the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza isn’t simply to win the fight with Hamas within the laws of war. There is a third imperative, one that will define the soldiers who fight and the nation they defend for years to come: Do not destroy your soul.

This is much easier said than done. To shrink from evil because the fight will be hard and complex and fraught with risk to soldiers and civilians alike is to both reward barbarism (it sends the signal that sufficient savagery will be rewarded with impunity) and to forsake the sacred duty of protecting your citizens from harm. To lean into the fight, to stretch your violent reach every bit as far as the law allows, can create both an ocean of anguish and bitterness in civilian populations and leave a bruise on the soul of the combatants themselves, altering their lives forever."

The attention of key allies is pivoting to the war in Gaza, military aid from the United States is bogged down in the Republican fight over leadership in Congress and cracks in European support have emerged during elections in Poland and Slovakia.

“We are now in a new phase,” Pavlo Klimkin, a former Ukrainian foreign minister, said of the international politics of the fighting in Ukraine, which in the past week has been eclipsed by the eruption of war in Israel and Gaza. “The whole geopolitical environment has become more diverse, more messy,” he said in an interview."
543,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/15/opinion/columnists/hamas-war-israel-gaza.html,"Consider: Hamas launched an attack with a wantonness like what the Nazis showed at Babyn Yar or ISIS at Sinjar. It did so knowing that it would provoke the most furious Israeli response possible. Why put millions of Palestinians at risk? Because Hamas has learned that it profits at least as much from Palestinian deaths as it does from Israeli ones — the more of each, the better.

Murdering Jews is an end in its own right for Hamas, because it believes it fulfills a theological aim. The original Hamas covenant invokes this injunction: “The Day of Judgment will not come about until Muslims fight Jews and kill them. Then, the Jews will hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks and trees will cry out: ‘O Muslim, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him.’” Hamas later softened the language from “Jews” to “Zionists” and “kill” to “resisting the occupation with all means and methods,” but the meaning is the same.

Hamas also achieves practical and propagandistic goals by putting Palestinians in harm’s way. More civilians in combat zones mean more human shields for its forces. More dead and wounded Palestinians mean more sympathy for its side and more condemnation of Israel.

That’s why Hamas turned Gaza’s central hospital into its headquarters during the 2014 conflict. It’s why it stored rockets in schools. It’s why it has used mosques to store guns. It’s why it fires rockets from Gaza’s densely populated areas. It does all this knowing that Israel, which has agreed to abide by the laws of war, tries to avoid hitting those targets — and, when it does hit them, that it will result in accusations of war crimes and diplomatic demands for restraint. Either way, Hamas gains an edge.

The cynicism doesn’t stop there. During a previous round of fighting, Hamas’s political leader, Khaled Meshaal, denounced Israel for committing a “Holocaust” against Palestinians. That, from the head of a terrorist group that has denied the Holocaust. Hamas also pleads for international sympathy on account of what it says is Gaza’s unfathomable poverty. In fact, Gaza and the West Bank’s per capita gross domestic product, at $5,600 in 2021 in terms of purchasing power, is not much lower than India’s."

When it passed, they surged forward, each one desperate to fill up a bottle or two to quench the thirst of the families they fled with.

“The hardest thing today is finding water to drink,” said Jihad Abu Hasaan, 54, a father of three who left his home in Gaza City in the north on Friday. “We hope that there is a humanitarian pause so that people can at least go search for water,” he added. Mr. Hasaan, the Gazan director of Première Urgence Internationale, a French charity, spoke from a training center in Khan Younis where his family was sheltering with some 5,000 people.

A fast-growing humanitarian crisis has erupted in southern Gaza, which is being inundated by hundreds of thousands of displaced people who fled northern Gaza in the past day alone, according to the UNRWA, the U.N. agency that aids Palestinians. In total, nearly half of Gaza’s population of more than two million has been displaced over the past week, the agency said on Saturday."
548,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/opinion/gaza-hamas-israel-war.html,"Gazans voted in Hamas in 2006 but have a mixed view of it, with a majority expressing some support but 70 percent saying in a July poll that they would like Hamas to hand over administration of the territory and its armed units to the much more moderate Palestinian Authority. Even a low-level Hamas official took me aside in 2015 and told me how much he hated the group because of its economic incompetence, and 62 percent of people in Gaza said this summer they wanted to continue the cease-fire with Israel.

So why did Hamas break that cease-fire so spectacularly? Perhaps because it knew that Israel would then respond by inflicting even more suffering on Gazans in ways that would make Hamas more popular. After clashes in 2021 that led to bombings by Israel, polls found Hamas surging in popularity among Palestinians — because when people see friends dying, their fury sometimes drives them to cheer anyone who appears to be fighting for them. In my interviews in Gaza, I have found that older people are exhausted by war and sometimes blame Hamas for provoking the bombings, but many who are young seem to relish the sight of someone fighting back.

Israel appears to believe that with a ground invasion, it can wipe out Hamas. I’m skeptical, and I suspect that even if Hamas as an organization were eliminated, extremism would intensify and new radical groups would arise. Nurtured by misery, Hamas is a Hydra: When one head is cut off, two more grow.

The natural constituency for moderation in Gaza is the business community, but Israel’s blockade since 2007 has devastated that sector and collapsed its influence. Partly because of the blockade and partly because of Hamas’s recalcitrance and incompetence, Gaza has a per capita income of only about $1,250, making it poorer than Haiti — and over the last week about 6,000 bombs have rained down from the sky and added to the agony. The United Nations says that more people have now died in Gaza than from the terror attacks in Israel, and I fear the killing in Gaza is just getting started.

The jingoism of some Americans isn’t helping. “Level the place,” advised Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. That “place” has more than two million inhabitants, including about one million children, and I shouldn’t have to remind a senator that when you care about some humans but not others, you’ve lost your humanity."
549,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/opinion/palestinian-ethical-resistance-answers-grief-and-rage.html,"In Israel today, the dynamic is almost exactly the opposite. Hamas, whose authoritarian, theocratic ideology could not be farther from the A.N.C.’s, has committed an unspeakable horror that may damage the Palestinian cause for decades to come. Yet when Palestinians resist their oppression in ethical ways — by calling for boycotts, sanctions and the application of international law — the United States and its allies work to ensure that those efforts fail, which convinces many Palestinians that ethical resistance doesn’t work, which empowers Hamas.

The savagery Hamas committed on Oct. 7 has made reversing this monstrous cycle much harder. It could take a generation. It will require a shared commitment to ending Palestinian oppression in ways that respect the infinite value of every human life. It will require Palestinians to forcefully oppose attacks on Jewish civilians, and Jews to support Palestinians when they resist oppression in humane ways — even though Palestinians and Jews who take such steps will risk making themselves pariahs among their own people. It will require new forms of political community, in Israel-Palestine and around the world, built around a democratic vision powerful enough to transcend tribal divides. The effort may fail. It has failed before. The alternative is to descend, flags waving, into hell.

As Jewish Israelis bury their dead and recite psalms for their captured, few want to hear at this moment that millions of Palestinians lack basic human rights. Neither do many Jews abroad. I understand; this attack has awakened the deepest traumas of our badly scarred people. But the truth remains: The denial of Palestinian freedom sits at the heart of this conflict, which began long before Hamas’s creation in the late 1980s.

Most of Gaza’s residents aren’t from Gaza. They’re the descendants of refugees who were expelled, or fled in fear, during Israel’s war of independence in 1948. They live in what Human Rights Watch has called an “open-air prison,” penned in by an Israeli state that — with help from Egypt — rations everything that goes in and out, from tomatoes to the travel documents children need to get lifesaving medical care. From this overcrowded cage, which the United Nations in 2017 declared “unlivable” for many residents in part because it lacks electricity and clean water, many Palestinians in Gaza can see the land that their parents and grandparents called home, though most may never set foot in it."

The official said that both Israel and Egypt had agreed to allow Americans to go through the Rafah crossing from Gaza between noon and 5 p.m. local time. But as of 4 p.m., the crossing remained closed, according to two families.

“This is absolutely nerve-racking,” said Lena Beseiso, 57, who was waiting on the Gaza side of the border with her husband, two of her daughters and a 10-year-old grandson, in a text message. “I’m so worried now more than ever before.”

There was no immediate comment from the State Department. The official who earlier had spoken of the agreement said it had been unclear whether Hamas, which controls Gaza, would allow the safe passage. There also had been no confirmation from Egyptian authorities that they would open the crossing."

It involves two of the most prominent modern figures in finance: Marc Rowan, the chief executive of Apollo and chair of the board of advisers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, and Scott Bok, the chief executive of Greenhill and chair of Penn’s trustees.

After Hamas’s terrorist attack last Saturday, Rowan called for Bok and Penn’s president, Elizabeth Magill, to resign. Rowan denounced, among other things, the school’s decision to allow on campus, two weeks earlier, a Palestinian literature festival that he said had hosted speakers who presented antisemitic ideas. He believes the school, his alma mater, has an inconsistent approach to the values of free speech.

“Words of hate and violence must be met with clear, reasoned condemnation, rooted in morality from those in positions of authority,” Rowan wrote in an opinion piece submitted to, but not published by, Penn’s student newspaper this week."

It was very dark, and electricity had been cut off for over 20 hours. My brother could not see me. I was just as black as the armchair I was sitting in. He took his place on a couch, and then the flash of an explosion a couple of kilometers away lit up the room.

“Oh, you are here?” My brother sounded surprised.

It had been a long day for all of us, especially parents. We have to be responsible not only for our own lives during Israel’s military attacks but also for the safety of children and the old around us. It’s been five days since I last had a shower. It’s been four days since I last left my house for the shop or the barber’s.

Nearly all the women and girls in my neighborhood have left for schools run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, which during escalation time turn into shelters. I try to see if we could find a room in a school nearby. One of the workers there advised me against it. “There are three times more people than the school can accommodate,” he said.

I decide to remain at our house, where my parents, two siblings and I live on different floors.

The next day at 10 a.m., we find my two sisters, Sondos and Saja, at our door with their husbands. Sondos is with her three small children — the oldest is 6 — and Saja is with little Zeina, whom she gave birth to two months ago."

“You may wonder how you can teach your child to move beyond the fears that a time of war brings,” the sheet read. “The good news is that, just as your child learns reading and writing, he or she can learn the skills of resilience — the ability to adapt well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats or even significant sources of stress.”

That’s good guidance, but parents still need to translate it into a language kids can understand.

We know people here on both sides of the conflict there. Their children all learn to read and write in the same Manhattan classrooms. Ghastly images of mutilated bodies in Israel and blasted apartment complexes in Gaza are as close as a few swipes on the iPads they use for their homework. “Monitor your child’s internet usage to ensure that she isn’t going to sites that will give gory or sensationalized accounts of war,” the American Psychological Association warned.

To be young is to be afloat in a current of events that you cannot understand.

My first glimpse of war came through CNN, watching the bombardment of Baghdad in 1991 with a fascination and fear that I understood only later. My mother says that as a 10-year-old, I was very worried that the smart bombs were falling close to our home rather than half a world away. In my parents’ attic there is, to this day, a box of gulf war newspaper clippings that I dutifully collected as a child. Those clippings — mostly infographics, if I’m honest — were a textbook of sorts. When I went to Baghdad as an adult to cover the Iraq war, I had long known the names of nearly all the military vehicles and weapons that were being used.

To be old is to be afloat in a current of events that you fool yourself into thinking you understand."

Mr. Jawad’s family arrived in New York after a brief stint in Jordan, joining a close-knit Arab American community in southwest Brooklyn. He has lived there ever since, raising seven children of his own and serving as vice president of the board of Beit El-Maqdis, a Sunset Park mosque.

Lines of cars double-parked outside the mosque as worshipers arrived for the Friday prayer — the most important service of the week — for the first time since the Israel-Hamas war began last Saturday.

555,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/opinion/biden-israel-gaza.html,"President Biden’s experience certainly should have prepared him for this moment of crisis in Israel and Palestine. He began his national political career with a run for the Senate in 1972 that turned on his pledge to fight the Nixon administration’s escalation of the Vietnam War. He opposed that war less on moral grounds than on pragmatic ones: that the war was futile and needlessly drained American resources and power.

Almost 50 years later, as his first major foreign policy act as president, he made a bold, difficult decision to end America’s longest war, in Afghanistan. He had inherited the plan from his predecessor Donald Trump and had qualms about the withdrawal agreement, which called for the U.S. to withdraw all troops in exchange for the Taliban pledging to keep the country from becoming a haven for terrorists. But Biden had been skeptical about the first of the post-9/11 forever wars for a very long time, as early as 2002, when he made his first visit to Kabul as a senator.

“We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan, hoping to create ideal conditions for the withdrawal and expecting a different result,” Biden said in April 2021.

This track record as a leader over an extraordinary and volatile stretch of human history, coupled with his unstinting support for the Jewish state, would make Biden the ideal messenger, should he choose to be, for the counsel Israel needs in the aftermath of Hamas’s brutal and lawless assault: A full-scale ground invasion of Gaza would almost certainly be a colossal mistake and a trap."

They wore “Free Palestine"" T-shirts and black-and-white kaffiyeh scarves, and scrolled through updates on the war as they waited for the sermon to begin.

Omar Tawil, the imam of the Islamic Community Center of Tempe, delivered an impassioned message that condemned the killings and displacements of Palestinian civilians as Israel expanded its war against Hamas. He urged worshipers to respond with prayer, protest and support for victims.

“You should be angry,” Mr. Tawil said. “What have the children of Gaza done? What have the civilians done?”

If the attack by Hamas united the diverse, sometimes divided communities of American Jews in horror and grief, the escalating airstrikes and humanitarian crisis unfolding in the Gaza Strip stirred common strains of anger, sorrow and grievance at Muslim prayer services across the country on Friday."

At least 11 journalists — nine Palestinian, one Lebanese and one Israeli — have been confirmed dead this week, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. At least one Israeli journalist has been reported missing, and many others have been injured.

The committee is investigating additional reports of the journalists killed, wounded and missing in or near Gaza. On Friday, a Reuters videographer was killed and at least six other journalists were injured amid shelling in Lebanon, according to the committee.

Sherif Mansour, coordinator for the Middle East at the Committee to Protect Journalists, said journalists in Gaza were trying to get information out while also scrambling to evacuate and protect their families. Many have lost their houses and offices, and some are working in a hospital because it’s the only place where they can get electricity and internet.

“I want to listen to what folks on the ground are asking for, and what we’ve heard is that people are asking for a cease-fire,” she added.

The protesters left Mr. Schumer’s residence just before 8 p.m. and moved to Flatbush Avenue, where they blocked traffic around Grand Army Plaza, one of the city’s busiest traffic loops.

The daytime rally unfolded amid the routine business of New York: pedicabs weaving, tourists navigating the crowds, people shopping for sneakers. But social media posts had spread false information about a terrorist attack supposedly planned to take place in Times Square at the same time as Friday’s protest. Cable news segments and tabloid coverage had warned about a “Global Day of Jihad.” A thrum of worry seemed to power endless doom scrolling.

American and NATO officials moved to reassure Mr. Zelensky, pledging another $2 billion in immediate military aid. But even before the war in the Mideast began last week, there was a strong sense in Europe, watching Washington, that the world had reached “peak Ukraine” — that support for Kyiv’s fight against Russia’s invasion would never again be as high as it was a few months ago.

The new run for the White House by former President Donald J. Trump is shaking confidence that Washington will continue large-scale support for Ukraine. But the concern, Europeans say, is larger than Mr. Trump and extends to much of his Republican Party, which has made cutting support for Ukraine a litmus test of conservative credibility.

Even in Europe, Ukraine is an increasingly divisive issue. Voters in Slovakia handed a victory to Robert Fico, a former prime minister sympathetic to Russia. A vicious election campaign in Poland, one of Ukraine’s staunchest allies, has emphasized strains with Kyiv. A far right opposed to aiding Ukraine’s war effort has surged in Germany, where Chancellor Olaf Scholz is struggling to win voters over to his call for a stronger military."

Mr. Abdallah’s death inside Lebanon was the first time that a journalist has been killed in the past week along the increasingly volatile border, an area that has seen fighting in recent days between Israeli forces and Iranian-backed militant groups, the most powerful of which is Hezbollah.

The second report, dated Oct. 5, built on the first but was more analytical.

The Oct. 5 report appeared in a daily C.I.A. summary of intelligence that is distributed widely to policymakers and lawmakers, the officials said. But intelligence officials did not brief either of the reports to President Biden or senior White House officials. Nor did the C.I.A. highlight the reports to White House policymakers as being of particular significance, officials said.

Like many Jews around the country, much of the weekend passed on the phone with family members, fearing for the safety of friends and extended family in Israel. Andino’s fellow students in Columbae, the social justice and antiwar residential house where she is a residential assistant, held her through her panic attacks. “I felt so powerless,” she recalled when we spoke this week.

On Monday, a friend asked if she’d seen the banner some of her housemates were preparing to hang on the front of Columbae, the house she considered to be her community and her home. The sheet bore the slogan “Zionism is genocide” in red letters, styled to look as if they were dripping with blood.

It would join other celebratory banners that had already gone up over the weekend on prominent university buildings around campus, including one that declared, “The illusion of Israel is burning.”

Stanford is in the throes of a teachable moment right now, and it’s not a good one.

In an opinion column in The Stanford Daily on Tuesday, the Stanford Students for Justice in Palestine called Hamas’s butchery “part of the ongoing, decades-long struggle against Israeli oppression” and said Palestinians have “the legitimate right to resist occupation, apartheid and systemic injustice.”"

Top U.S. counterterrorism officials and law enforcement officials in many cities said there were no credible threats related to the Israel-Gaza war. But authorities still increased security around religious institutions and other public places.

In New York City, which has been on edge in the week since the attacks in Israel began, police officials reassured residents and increased patrols around synagogues and mosques and deployed more uniformed officers at large gatherings and cultural sites.

There was a noticeable increase in police presence, whether at transit hubs like Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal or synagogues and other Jewish sites. Jewish day schools were on high alert on Friday, with some canceling classes."

And sometimes we’re so quick to go to the ‘but’ part that we negate that opportunity to grieve, which might be a place for coming together in grief. If we felt we could just have a moment of grief, we might not have to be so polarized about it.”

For some in the congregation, the attacks have meant wrestling with internal conflict. Sarah Sokolic, Lab/Shul’s executive director, said she grew up being taught that Israel was good and Palestinians were bad, and has worked for the last two decades to promote more nuanced, progressive views.

Now, she said: “I find myself asking, How can I be a Zionist and be a person who does anti-oppression work at the same time? How can I teach my children about power, oppression, equity, empathy, otherness while also teaching them that Israel is our homeland, and that Israel has a right to exist and defend herself?” As she wrestles, she said, “I find myself leaning into my Zionist roots.”

Some of the most contentious conversations this week took place on college campuses, or among students on online platforms. Student groups at New York University School of Law and Columbia University issued statements supporting Palestinians and blaming Israel for the attacks, leaving many Jewish students feeling “disillusioned and very isolated,” said Yuda Drizin, the rabbi for the Chabad community at Columbia.

“That’s the main thing — loneliness,” the rabbi said, adding that students he had never spoken with before had approached him. “It’s across the political spectrum,” he said. “They say they walk through campus and they don’t know who thinks they deserve to be dead.”"

American intelligence agencies tracked the shipment of military equipment and munitions as it made its way from North Korea on a Russian-flagged ship to a Russian port and from there by rail to an ammunition depot not far from Ukraine, officials said.

“We condemn the D.P.R.K. for providing Russia with this military equipment, which will be used to attack Ukrainian cities, kill Ukrainian civilians and further Russia’s illegitimate war,” said John F. Kirby, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, using the initials for North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

Mr. Kirby gave no details about the nature of the munitions but said the White House was especially concerned that Russia would repay North Korea by providing it more sophisticated weapons and technology it otherwise would not have available under international sanctions. American intelligence agencies have concluded that North Korea has requested fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment and other materials and advanced technologies."
568,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/opinion/hamas-israel-land-acknowledgements.html,"But the forces unleashed in Israel last week, and the response from progressivism’s more strident and literal-minded pupils, can’t simply be written out of the story of what the far left stands for, or what it might become. Here is Levitz, for instance, trying to read terrorism’s apologists out of True Leftism:

What we actually witnessed was not “the Palestinians” mounting a violent struggle for justice but a far-right theocratic organization committing mass murder in the name of blood-and-soil nationalism. Hamas’s project is antithetical to the left’s foundational values of secularism, universalism and egalitarianism. And it is also completely at odds with the progressive vision for Palestinian liberation. Western radicals’ predominant prescription for resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict is a “one-state solution,” in which Israelis and Palestinians all enjoy democratic equality in a single binational state. Hamas’s atrocities have not advanced this ideal but set it back, lending credence to those who insist a one-state solution is a recipe for ceaseless civil war. This weekend was not a triumph for the left’s project in Palestine but a disaster.

I endorse the moral sentiments but not the ideological analysis. Who is to say, definitively, that a fully realized “left” vision for Palestine necessarily involves Israelis and Palestinians living in harmony in a single multiethnic state? If Israel is really a society of settler-colonialist villains inhabiting stolen land, why shouldn’t the left side with those Palestinian activists who don’t think Jews deserve any place in the glorious future achieved through the revolutionary struggle of the dispossessed? Why must Palestinians be expected to share the postcolonial utopia, the land justly reclaimed, with the children of the imperialist oppressors? And if the struggle to be free of those oppressors is being led, for the time being, by religious nationalists rather than secular egalitarian universalists — well, the leftist rationale might be, sometimes you can’t make an anti-imperialist omelet without a few religious extremists to break the eggs.

My point is not that these are the sentiments of most progressives; they are not. But they are impeccably left-wing sentiments, commonplace in the not-so-distant past, with a long pedigree in the Marxist-Leninist and anticolonial visions that exerted so much sway (and killed so many people) across the 20th century. Indeed, as Shullenberger notes, some of these visions even anticipated the therapeutic style in which they are presented to us nowadays — but they did so while insisting, as in the work of Frantz Fanon, that revolutionary violence itself was therapeutic, a means by which the colonized can achieve self-assertion, dignity and wholeness.

Of late there has been a lot of attention paid (including in this newsletter) to the infiltration of far-right ideas and influences into mainstream conservatism — the return, under populist auspices, of Nietzschean and “vitalist” ideas once buried in the rubble of 20th-century fascism. This attention is reasonable; the decay of Western liberalism has revived a variety of right-wing impulses, and the sleep of American Christianity may breed post-Christian monsters.

But with the left, where similar temptations are at work, it doesn’t make sense to talk in terms of Donald Trump-enabled infiltrations or seduction by pseudonymous internet philosophers. The revival of the ideological perspective that once romanticized Lenin and Stalin, and later Mao and the Khmer Rouge and a host of lesser-known dictators, has happened in plain sight, across many of our finest academic institutions and prominent foundations. It’s just been accompanied by a huge asterisk, a promise that all the rhetoric is therapeutic and psychological, that when we talk about stolen land and ending “whiteness” and decolonizing everything, we are, of course, merely speaking culturally, symbolically, metaphorically.

However comforting you may have found that asterisk, it should feel less comfortable now."
569,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/briefing/israel-gaza-evacuations-invasion.html,"For years, Israeli officials have worried about the threat of Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Still, they viewed a full ground invasion of Gaza to be too dangerous and costly to try. Many Israeli soldiers would die. The widespread killing of Palestinian civilians would damage Israel’s global reputation. The invasion might fail to dismantle Hamas.

Last weekend’s attacks by Hamas — killing more than 1,300 people, mostly civilians — have changed this calculation. Israel’s leaders and many of its citizens seem to have decided they now have no choice but to invade, and the military has ordered more than one million people to evacuate northern Gaza. Israel’s goals are to prevent Hamas from being able to conduct more attacks and to reestablish the country’s military credibility.

But the same challenges that kept Israel from invading Gaza before have not gone away. The war, as a result, has the potential to become another case study in the strategic difficulties of urban warfare, as the U.S. experienced in Falluja, Iraq, nearly two decades ago, Israel did in Lebanon during the 1980s and Russia has in Ukraine.

“We’ve been welcomed in a home by these humble people whom I’ve never met before,” Ms. Beseiso said. “Leaving behind the house where my children grew up, laughed, played, while we were relocating from the north to the south was one of the hardest things I’ve seen other than this ugly war.”"

Hamas killed dozens of Israelis, including children, in an attack in Kfar Aza, a kibbutz near Gaza. A French television correspondent’s unverified report that 40 babies were beheaded in the attack went viral on social media as if it were fact. The report remains unconfirmed. It even seeped into a statement by President Biden that he had seen photographs of that particular horror, prompting the White House to walk back his remarks a bit, saying the information had come from news accounts.

Hamas has adroitly exploited social media to promote its cause the way Al Qaeda and the Islamic State once did. It used the Telegram app, which is largely unfiltered, as a conduit to push celebratory and graphic images of its incursion from Gaza into broader circulation on social networks that have barred terrorist organizations.

Increasingly, our digitized lives have become an information battleground, with every side in any conflict vying to offer its version. Old images have been recycled to make a new point. At the same time, actual images have been disputed as fakes, including a bloody photograph that Donald J. Trump Jr., the former president’s son, shared on X.

Reliable news organizations used to function as curators, verifying information and contextualizing it, and they still do. Nevertheless, some have sought to question their reliability as gatekeepers, most prominently Elon Musk, the owner of X.

The day after the fighting in Israel erupted, Mr. Musk shared a post on X encouraging his followers to trust the platform more than mainstream media, recommending two accounts that have been notorious for spreading false claims. (Mr. Musk later deleted the post but not before it had been seen millions of times.)"

sabrina tavernise

From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise, and this is “The Daily.” In the weeks since Israel suffered the deadliest day in its history, fresh accounts have emerged in village after village of just how extreme and how widespread the violence actually was. Today, the story of one man at the epicenter of that violence. It’s Friday, October 13.

golan abitbol

Hello.

sabrina tavernise

Hi, Golan. This is Sabrina Tavernise from “The Daily,” from “The New York Times” “Daily” podcast.

golan abitbol

Hi.

sabrina tavernise

Hi. Thank you for talking to us.

golan abitbol

Yeah, of course. And I’m on my way to the — I think it’s the most quiet place I can find.

sabrina tavernise

Great. Perfect. Golan, thank you so much. I know you must be absolutely exhausted.

golan abitbol

Yeah, it’s not easy.

sabrina tavernise

Where are you right now?

golan abitbol

We are at — all the community were evacuated to a hotel in the Dead Sea, all the refugees. And we all got to this place. This is — practically, I think 90 percent of the hotel is people from my kibbutz.

sabrina tavernise

Golan, can you identify yourself for me, please? Tell me your name, your age, and where you live.

golan abitbol

My name is Golan Abitbol, and my age is 44. I live in kibbutz Be’eri. And I was born in the kibbutz. The kibbutz was established in ‘46. It’s older than the state of Israel. And it’s a quiet place surrounded by nature. And I’ve been living there all my life with my family.

sabrina tavernise

How many people in the kibbutz?

golan abitbol

We have, like, 1,000 people in the kibbutz. And we know each one of them by name, because we lived with them since I was born. And we know the names of the kids. We know everybody. We all vouch for each other. We all take care of each other. And it’s an amazing place to raise your kids in.

sabrina tavernise

Do you have children?

golan abitbol

I have four kids. The older one is 15. His sister is 14. And my twin girls are nine.

sabrina tavernise

Oh, twin girls.

golan abitbol

Yeah. And the kids are going freely. They don’t have any traffic inside the kibbutz. Just go send the kids to the grandparents on the other side of the kibbutz, and they can go and you don’t worry, because nothing bad can happen.

sabrina tavernise

Golan, I’m going to turn us now to the attack. But first, I want you to tell me about Friday. How did you spend the day before the attack began? What was Friday like for you?

golan abitbol

On Friday morning, 5:00 in the morning, I got up in Reykjavik, Iceland.

sabrina tavernise

Oh, my goodness.

golan abitbol

I woke up in Reykjavik, Iceland, coming back from work and landing in Israel at about 6:00 in the evening. And two hours later, I was at home. So this was my Friday. And I saw my kids after a week, I didn’t see them. I spent time with them. We ate dinner together. I saw my friends. We had some drinks and went to sleep like a normal Friday. And then, we woke up in, about, 6:20 in the morning, to the sound of launching missiles. It was a huge, huge launch. And I remember telling my wife, what is going on? What is — it’s out of the blue. We are on the border of Gaza. We know what it’s like to have missile attacks. We are used to it. But this time, it was weird. It was suddenly, and it was so intensive. And a few minutes later, we got a text message. We have an app of the community. So we got a text that there is an invasion to the kibbutz and that we should lock ourselves in the shelter. In the second I got this message, I went to my safe and took my gun. It’s a pistol. It’s a small 9-millimeter pistol, and it’s what I have for personal defense. So the first thing that felt right to do, for me, is to take the gun out and lock my family in the shelter, and then took the front position in the kitchen where I can have a better view of the neighborhood. And if someone come, I can respond and engage before they come to my house. And next, we started to hear shooting, and we started to hear talks in Arabic. And I was looking outside of the kitchen windows, and then I saw in the outside perimeter of my neighborhood. And I saw some terrorists standing outside with RPGs and heavy machine guns.

sabrina tavernise

What did you think at that moment?

golan abitbol

I knew it was bad. And then, I saw them exiting an apartment of one of my friends. I saw three guys with a fighting vest with all the equipment, the gear, and the helmets, and behind them, three guys wearing civilian uniforms. And they were exiting my neighbor apartment. And oh, it was horrible. I didn’t know what to do — if he’s alive, if he’s dead, his kid — I didn’t know. I just saw them exiting the apartment. And then, there was units starting, entering the neighborhood. I saw them going near one of the families and start shouting, “Tzahal“, “Tzahal” like “IDF“, “IDF“, to make my neighbors think that they are from the IDF, and they will give up and get out.

sabrina tavernise

To make your neighbors think they were actually from the Israeli military. That’s the IDF.

golan abitbol

Yeah. And this group were dressed like Israeli police officers. But something about the way they were dressed — they were — I don’t know how to describe it — a bit sloppy, sloppy. It’s not — it didn’t feel right for me. And I text my friend, I don’t think it’s the IDF. Don’t open the door. And then, I heard Arabic from really, really close and heard shooting from real close. And I saw, from around the corner, terrorists. I saw them going towards my balcony. I was standing at my post at the kitchen, and I just saw them coming from around the corner. I saw their face. And you could see murder in their eyes. I saw in their eyes, they are going to kill my family. I need to shoot now, or else, it’s going to be my family. It’s now or never. So I started shooting. I gave a burst of five or six bullets towards them, and they shot back at my home. They shot with automatic weapons. So then, I’m shooting now from here, and I’m going to a different position to shoot from a different position. Because you don’t fire twice from the same position. So it seems like there are more than one armed persons inside the house. In Israel, you join the army at the age of 18, and then you do reserve duty until you are about the age of 40. So you don’t think. You act like a warrior. You switch to a different mood, and it’s like a muscle memory. And it’s like a slow-motion movie. Everything is slow. Everything is — you see every move like flow. And then, you hear them shooting back, and then it’s like a fast-forward. You jump to the floor and hide from the bullets.

sabrina tavernise

So the time moves slowly and is suspended. And then the time moves very quickly and speeds up.

golan abitbol

Yeah. Yeah.

sabrina tavernise

It’s like a weird dream or something.

golan abitbol

Yeah. Like a weird dream.

sabrina tavernise

Do you remember feeling fear?

golan abitbol

Yeah, of course. Of course. And if you don’t feel fear, you are an idiot. I felt fear, and I felt fear for my family and my neighbors. But the fear is set aside, and now, it’s time to engage the enemy. So then, after several bursts of fire toward the balcony and toward the rest of the house, they shot the house from many positions. But my family were in the safe room, and the safe room can stand the heat of a missile. So I wasn’t worried about them. It’s OK. Shoot the house as much as you like. I’m on the floor. It’s OK now. And then, I don’t know why they left. They decided to go. They went to a different house. Then it got quiet. It got quiet. When I say quiet, I mean I didn’t see any attackers, any terrorists outside. You could always, always hear, all the time, the noise of the weapons shooting outside. I can hear them throwing grenades. But I didn’t see, for an hour, anyone else. And then, I heard one of my neighbors texting the group of the neighborhood that they’re in his house and they are trying to break into the safe room, but he was holding on to the lever so they won’t be able to open the door. And then, I guess they got tired of trying to — and they just set the house on fire. And at first, I didn’t see the fire. Then I heard a weird noise, a weird unfamiliar noise of cracking stuff. Seems like stuff is cracking. It’s cracking wood. And I looked outside and I saw all the top floor on fire. And they started texting that the fire, the smoke is getting inside the safe room. And in the kibbutz text group, they said you need to put wet fabric on your mouth to shield you from the smoke. But the house is on fire. And in certain time, it wasn’t safe for them anymore. And I told them, I don’t see anyone outside from my position. So they jumped to the ground level, the family with the two kids, and ran straight to the neighbor’s house and got inside to his safe room together with him.

sabrina tavernise

So the whole village was giving them instruction by text.

golan abitbol

No, no, no. The whole village was giving each other instruction. We were all under attack, not only our neighborhood. There were some neighborhoods closer to the eastern side — the side of Gaza that were heavily attacked — much heavier attacks than we got. They got RPGs on their house on the safe rooms. And then, in the text group, the daughter of one of my best friends just sent a recording over. She wasn’t shouting. She was whispering. Help us. My mother and brother are dying. My father is hurt and is dying. They are trying to enter the house, and it’s on fire.

sabrina tavernise

God.

golan abitbol

And she just kept on sending this kind of message. And I know this girl. I know she’s a good friend of my girls, and she’s been to our house several times, and I used to work with her father. And we are one family. We are like one family. And I hear her recording, just help us, help us. My father is dying. My mother is already dead. My older brother is lying dead. And you feel helpless.

sabrina tavernise

How old is she?

golan abitbol

I think about 10 years old. She had to see her parents critically injured in front of her eyes and just, she couldn’t do anything. And I couldn’t do anything, and no one could do anything. Later on, I heard they managed to rescue both of them after shooting with a tank, because there were terrorists inside their home. And they survived. The girl is OK, and their father just got out of surgery. He lost his leg. But he’s alive. He’s with us. Not like a lot of my friends.

sabrina tavernise

But the rest of her family was killed.

golan abitbol

[SIGHS]: The rest of her family was killed.

sabrina tavernise

Golan, when did you finally leave the house? And when did the police finally respond?

golan abitbol

We heard a big noise, really weird one. And I opened the window to get a different view, and I saw tanks — tanks on the neighborhood. It’s not something — it’s not something you’re supposed to see. So I know things are going to change. But I don’t know how long it’s going to take. And then, a unit of the army came and took us out. It was nighttime, but we could see a lot. To see the kibbutz burned to the ground, it was horrible. We could see the house of my neighbors. Normally, when you have a fire in the house, the firefighters are coming, and they put out the fire. But here, I could see the fire dies out after burning everything. We were encircled by the soldiers who kept us safe and took us. And they told us to close the eyes of the young kids so they won’t see the dead bodies of the terrorists lying outside, so they won’t have to have this kind of memories in their mind, they won’t be scarred more than they are already scarred. And we went to the entrance of the kibbutz, and they took us to the evacuation area. And we were just about to go on a truck, an army truck, to evacuate us. And then from the bushes, one of the terrorists just started shooting at us with no cover. And we had to lie on my kids and protect them, my twins. I had to shelter them with my body and shout to my kids, I lost my two grownup kids. I shouted them, where are you? Where are you? And it seems like forever, but they killed the terrorists very quickly, the soldiers. And no one was injured.

sabrina tavernise

What time was that, approximately? Do you have any sense of that?

golan abitbol

That was 10:00 at night, 10:30, when we left the perimeter. And it began at 6:00 in the morning.

sabrina tavernise

That is so many hours.

golan abitbol

That’s eternity. It’s — I just can’t describe the feelings. It just felt like an eternity. And later on, we were evacuated to the hotel in the Dead Sea, where we are now.

sabrina tavernise

Did anybody in your neighborhood die?

golan abitbol

We don’t know. We don’t know. We get drips by drips of names. And today, all the grownups in the community got inside the conference room of the hotel, and they were sitting there, some members of the community, with the list. And they were starting to read the names of the people we know are dead. And each one of the members got the page and start reading, like, 10 names, and then collapsed back. And then, the other one next to him stands and starts reading some more names and sits back. And I don’t know how many. I don’t know how many. I couldn’t count. And then, I know each one of them. I know each one of them, and they read the names. And then they paused and said, now, we are going to read the names of the people who we don’t know where they are. And it was just as long. A good friend of mine — she was — they broke into her safe room. They pulled her out, she and their kids, and they told them to sit outside. And they took all the men and the boys from this group, put them on a track, and just went to Gaza. And they took her son — the best friend of my son. He’s 16 years old, and he’s the most adorable, gentle kid, and they just ripped him away from the hands of his mother. And my son is devastated, and we are all devastated. And we don’t know what happened to our family. We don’t know what happened to our friends. We know that they kill 1 out of 10 of our community. 1 out of 10 is dead. But a lot more were taken. They took babies. They took kids. They took elderly people. 80-year-old woman — she was like my grandmother. I know her from the day I was born. She was like my grandmother. And we were laughing together, like, two weeks ago. And now, they took her. Why? What kind of — they are not human beings. They are not human beings. A human being couldn’t do this kind of — they are vicious killers. They are not freedom fighters. They are not fighting to liberate their country and our community. Donated, every year, money to some people who used to work in the kibbutz.

sabrina tavernise

These are people from Gaza?

golan abitbol

People from Gaza — they were our friends, and we donated money to them. The mother of a friend of mine who was kidnapped — she used to go once a week to one of the border crossing with Gaza Strip and pick up, with her car, children and take them to get dialysis in Israeli hospitals. And now, she’s in Gaza. We are liberal person. We don’t believe that all of the people in Gaza are evil. We don’t believe. We didn’t believe. I’m sorry. We didn’t believe. I don’t know what I’m thinking now. I don’t know what to think now, because we always thought that peace and negotiation is the solution. And I don’t think anyone thinks now. We lost our faith. We don’t think there could be any kind of reason to talk with these animals that destroyed my kibbutz, kidnapped my family. And we want them back. We can’t be a community without them. They are part of us. It’s like a jigsaw puzzle. You can’t take one piece and it will be OK. The ones that dead are gone, OK, but we need them. We need the ones that survive. Get my neighbors back. I want them back. They’re my friends. They are my family. I want them back. And I go in the hotel, and it’s like a roller coaster of emotions. Because I hear someone just died, and it breaks my heart, and I collapse. And second later, I see someone arriving that I was sure that he was dead, and I was afraid to ask. And then another one is dead, and another one is alive, and it’s a roller coaster of emotions. [SIGH]

sabrina tavernise

What are the children like in the hotel? How are your nine-year-old daughters?

golan abitbol

[SIGHS]: My twins are playing. They talked to a psychiatrist, and they didn’t saw anything. They heard the noise of the shooting, but they didn’t saw the terrorist. They didn’t saw the bodies. My older kids saw the bodies. They know about their friends that were kidnapped. They know about their friends that were slaughtered. They know. And they will never be kids again. Their childhood is over. And I know my son will never be the same again. His childhood is over. His friends are dead or gone in Gaza, and — and now, we need to start to rebuild our life from scratch. And from the moment we arrived here, we rebuild infrastructure of the community — this person in charge of finding people a place to sleep in, someone who is in charge of activities for the kids, and we have a person who is in charge of the elderly persons, and the nurse of the kibbutz is in charge of getting people their medicines that they left back at home. We rebuild our community here in the hotel so we could survive the day to come. Because we don’t know how long we are going to be here. We don’t know if we have a place to go back to. I don’t know if my home is still standing. I don’t know. And it’s still under army quarantine. So we can’t go back home. We are here like refugees. So for now, I’m still in the hotel and trying to hold on, trying to go on one day at a time.

sabrina tavernise

Do you feel that it changed you?

golan abitbol

I’m sure it did. I always say I was scratched already before with all the military service I’ve been through. But this is a different kind of scratch. So many friends of mine died. So many. When half of your friends die, there is no coming back. There is — you’re not — I’m not going to be the same person as before. I’m trying to keep my humor as much as I can, but none of us are going to be the same again. My kids are not going to be the same again. I’m not going to be the same again. None of us — Israel is not going to be the same again. We went through a second Holocaust, and unfortunately, I had the opportunity to be in the front line. We’re not going to be the same.

kevin roose

So Casey, I get a lot of deranged and unintelligible texts from you.

casey newton

You’re welcome.

kevin roose

Thanks. And even by those standards, the one that I got from you last night while I was sitting down for dinner was pretty wild. So this was a text that contained a link to something called Bonk. And your text said the following — “Bonk me on Bonk. My handle is CaseyNewton.”

casey newton

That’s right.

kevin roose

So Casey, why are you asking me to Bonk you, and, um, do you know that I’m happily married?

casey newton

I did hear that, although I was told there was an AI with different ideas. But Bonk is the app that everyone in Silicon Valley is talking about. And by everyone, I mean a few of my friends who showed it to me.

kevin roose

(LAUGHING) What is this app?

casey newton

OK, it’s the best. So do you remember the app Yo from back in the day?

kevin roose

Yes, this was an app, like, 10 years ago that did only one thing. You could push a button, and it would tell — it would, like, say “Yo” to someone.

casey newton

That’s exactly right. It was like sort of — when there was all this buzz about these new messaging apps, and then this messaging app came along they could only do one thing. And it was sort of like —

kevin roose

And it was a parody of an app.

casey newton

It felt that way. And yet, it was a sort of parody that raised $1.5 million at a $10 million valuation. OK? 2014 was wild. Loved those times. But then Yo disappears, and then many years go by. And then, along comes Bonk. Can I tell you about the Bonk product?

kevin roose

Please.

casey newton

OK. First of all, I tried to get you to download it, but you can’t, because you don’t have iOS 17, which is truly funny, because when you see what this app does, it’s not clear to me that it’s relying on any of the latest sensors and graphical upgrades.

kevin roose

Right. I do not yet have the advanced technology required to run the Bonk app.

casey newton

But if you run — here’s what you do. So you add your friend on Bonk, and then you Bonk them. How do you Bonk them? Well, you just see their username on the screen.

kevin roose

OK, so you are showing me this app. It has a list of three of your friends on Bonk with a big blue button, one for each friend.

casey newton

That’s right. And if you don’t have any friends on Bonk, you can’t Bonk the Bonk bot. There’s a Bonk bot for you to Bonk. It’s sort of like the Tom of Myspace of Bonk — is the Bonk bot.

kevin roose

No, this is a prank. This is a late April Fool’s joke.

casey newton

So here’s what you do. So here’s one of my friends, and I can just sort of annoy him right now by Bonking him.

kevin roose

You’re just pressing Bonk over and over again.

casey newton

And every time I Bonk him, he gets a push notification.

kevin roose

(LAUGHING) No!

casey newton

So ever since —

kevin roose

This is malware.

casey newton

So ever since I’ve downloaded this app, I’ll look at my phone, and I’ll have, like, 46 notifications that just say “Your friend Bonked you.”

kevin roose

(LAUGHING) Why does this exist?

casey newton

(LAUGHING) It’s like — here’s the best part. So as if that weren’t annoying enough, when you type over on this menu, there’s a leaderboard, and it shows you how many Bonks you’ve sent and how many Bonks your friends have sent.

kevin roose

Wait! You have Bonked someone 5,064 times?!

casey newton

(LAUGHING) That’s — no! One of the people who introduced me to the app has sent 5,000 Bonks this week. I’ve only sent 438.

kevin roose

This is grounds for being arrested.

casey newton

What I love about this so much is it’s like what if Yo was just a tool for benign harassment?

kevin roose

Yeah, this is a harassment app.

casey newton

Absolutely. Absolutely. But you know, at the same time, it is nice during the day, just to let someone know that you’re thinking about them. Even though you have nothing to say — when you have nothing to say, but you still want to say something, that’s when you Bonk.

kevin roose

Well, I will not be installing this app anywhere on any device that I own, because the thought of getting 57,000 Bonks a day from you just fills me with dread.

casey newton

Well, and you are somebody who worries he spends too much time on your phone, so I understand how you wouldn’t want to install it. But if you are looking to literally waste your life on your phone — and who isn’t — please check out Bonk. I was texting with the creator the other day, and he was telling me that he hopes to get it into the App Store soon. Right now, it’s only available on TestFlight, which is the beta testing app on the iPhone. But you can find it at bonkbonkbonk.app.

kevin roose

No.

casey newton

Yeah.

kevin roose

No, no, no, do not download Bonk. Do not encourage this behavior.

casey newton

If I were the creator, I would create merch. I would create a bumper sticker, and it would just say, “Honk if you’re Bonking.”

kevin roose

(LAUGHING) No!

casey newton

Yes!

kevin roose

No!

casey newton

Kevin —

kevin roose

No, I cannot endorse this technology.

casey newton

Kevin, think about all the time we spend talking about misinformation, hate speech, harassment, all of it! This is a social app where you can only harass someone by making them want to turn off their phone. And that’s a new kind of harassment we haven’t seen yet, but it seems very sweet to me.

kevin roose

OK. Well, if I ever get another Bonk from you, I will be reporting it to the authorities and getting a restraining order, so please stop.

casey newton

Hey, catch me on Bonk! [MUSIC PLAYING]

kevin roose

I’m Kevin Roose. I’m a tech columnist at “The New York Times.”

casey newton

I’m Casey Newton from “Platformer.”

kevin roose

And you’re listening to “Hard Fork.”

casey newton

This week, what the war between Israel and Hamas means for the future of social networks. Then, Kevin visits a prediction markets conference, and we place some bets. And finally, Osmo CEO Alex Wiltschko on his quest to build an AI that can smell. [MUSIC PLAYING]

kevin roose

So Casey, we like to have a good time on this podcast, but there has actually been a lot of very serious news this week coming out of the Middle East. I’m talking, of course, about the war between Israel and Hamas. And this is a tech show. We are not foreign policy experts or experts on conflicts in the Middle East. There are plenty of great podcasts where you can get that kind of information. But I did want to talk about it today, because I think there’s a really important thing that I’ve observed in our social media ecosystem, which is that from what I can tell, there has been no place to actually get good reliable information about this conflict. Like, I’m sure I, like you and so many other people, opened up X and Instagram and all of my other apps, trying to make sense and sort out what was going on. And I just couldn’t do it. I was just bombarded with stuff that was fake or misleading or suspicious in some way. It was very hard to just get the basic nuts and bolts of what was going on. And I’m wondering if you experienced that, too.

casey newton

Yeah, very much so. I think that one of the ways that we understand what’s going on in the world right now is by using these social media apps, right? Over the past decade-plus, we have trained ourselves. When something horrible is happening, our first thought has been to go to Twitter specifically, right? Because for the longest time, Twitter was the best answer to the question of what is going on. Because not only did you get reports from the journalists who were on the ground there, or from the elected officials who were sort of handling the tragedy, but you also had these first-person reports, people who were just average users, who whipped out their phone. They took out a video. They posted a thread. And this was sort of collectively how we made sense of things. But for all of the reasons that we have been talking about on this show over the past year, that world is now in chaos. It has been upended by all of the changes on the consumer internet. And so I think that’s sort of what brings this story into our zone, is that one of the main ways we have for understanding events in real time is just changing radically.

kevin roose

Well, and the stakes are just much higher in wartime, right? During normal sort of peacetime, getting bad information on social media might be annoying. It might be misleading. It might even be harmful. But during the fog of war, when there are so many conflicting reports flying around — images, videos, first-person accounts or things purporting to be first-person accounts — that’s when the stakes of conflict and of information get really real. So there’s been some reporting over the past week about X, as Twitter is now called, and many of the viral falsehoods that have been appearing on the site. People are sharing videos from previous conflicts that are years old. People are circulating video game footage and passing it off as wartime footage, fake images of celebrities taking sides, and actually, things that have caught the attention of regulators in Europe who have warned Elon Musk and X that by hosting this kind of content, it may be in violation of some of the EU’s content moderation laws.

casey newton

Yeah. So there’s a lot in there to pull apart. I am somebody who thinks that Elon Musk has been laying the groundwork for this for a long time and that, in a lot of ways, this is the logical culmination of a story that began when he decided that he was going to get rid of the old verification system. But I mean, does any of that surprise you at this point, Kevin?

kevin roose

It doesn’t, because Elon Musk — he’s been so clear about the fact that he doesn’t like the mainstream media, doesn’t want journalists to have sort of special privileges or status on X. And he has been boosting his own set of what he calls “citizen journalists,” these people who are sort of amateurs, many of which have turned out to be questionable or incorrect. He warned users away from trusting mainstream journalists on the subject, instead promoting two accounts that are known spreaders of misinformation. And you had a really interesting newsletter on this week where you talked about the failure of X to live up to its past as a real-time news platform.

casey newton

Well, you know, again, I think that we have just seen Elon laying the groundwork for this for months, right? One of the first things that he did was he got rid of the old verification badges, and now, you can get one of these badges by paying $8 a month. I think probably, just as importantly, you can now make money based on the number of views you get if you have paid your $8 a month. And so what are we seeing? If you look at a lot of people who are repurposing video of things that happened long ago, or video game footage and trying to pass it off as events in this war, those people have verification badges, right? Which suggests to me they are hoping to get a payout, based on the number of impressions they are getting for spreading misinformation. So that’s actually quite different from what we used to see in the old days, right? Lord knows the old Twitter had plenty of problems. It spread plenty of misinformation. There were people doing the exact same thing in those days that are doing it now. The difference is they weren’t being paid to do it. And at the same time, Elon has also given these spreaders of misinformation so many powerful tools.

kevin roose

Yeah, and this is sort of an annoyance and a frustration for people in the US, but for people who are actually in the conflict zone, for people who are in Gaza, who are in Israel, this is potentially a very big problem for them if they cannot use social media or to figure out what is going on, and maybe getting bad or incomplete information about their surroundings or their safety.

casey newton

Yeah. And again, I mean, to some degree, this was always the case. Like, I want to be clear.

kevin roose

Yes. We shouldn’t romanticize what old Twitter was like or sort of turn it into this thing that it wasn’t. It was never a perfect disseminator of news in breaking situations.

casey newton

Right. And I would say, particularly, like, five years ago, if you were in the middle of some calamity and you said, like, should I rely on Twitter to understand what to do next, I would say, well, it should be like an input, but you should be trying to guide yourself toward vetted, credible sources of information. And random tweets are, like, maybe not going to be that thing. But at the same time, I think that the utility of these networks actually goes beyond understanding, OK, where is the worst violence right now for me to avoid. It also is about understanding the conversation around these things, right? What sort of positions are people staking out? What is the conversation here? And that is actually one of the ways that we make sense of this, right? And that is another way in which X is just not as useful as Twitter once was. Because many of the most prominent voices here have either stopped using the platform entirely over the past year or they’re being drowned out by people who paid $8 a month so that their voices float to the top of replies. So just as a means for understanding the conversation around these terrible events, X is just not nearly as useful as it used to be.

kevin roose

So where were you getting news? Where are you getting news about this conflict if it’s not on X?

casey newton

Yeah, so I spend much more time these days on three networks. That would be Bluesky, Mastodon, and Threads, which is Meta’s app. And I was having the most interesting experiences on Threads of those. I think Bluesky is pretty vibrant among a certain crowd, but Threads has really started to accelerate, particularly over the past couple of weeks, in bringing on just some of the most influential voices in media in particular, right? Like, this is where I’m starting to see the reporters show up, seeing people like — your colleague, Sheera Frenkel, for example, had her fascinating story about how Hamas was seeding X with these violent videos as part of its terror campaign. I learned about that on Threads, right? People who are in the sort of more pundit sphere — they were sharing their analysis on Threads. And so it definitely is not what the old Twitter was — for following real-time news for reasons that we can get into if you want to. It has started to feel a lot more vibrant and, I think, has revealed how desperate people are for something to replace what Twitter used to be.

kevin roose

Yeah. So I found this part really interesting, because I agree with you that it seems like Threads has sort of picked up, at least among the journalists that I know and follow. And at the same time, when we talked to Adam Mosseri, the head of Threads, earlier this year, he was pretty explicit about not wanting it to be a place where everyone came to get news about important global conflicts. They’ve been trying to position this as something more like a TikTok for text, something that is going to be fun and entertaining and light and sort of not drag them into the morass of content moderation that they have seen on their other products. So how do you think that tension is playing out right now?

casey newton

Well, it’s an interesting question, because I’m not sure what the positive vision for Threads was when it launched. In fact, I think, like many apps, they wanted to just put it in the world to see what people did with it. I think they would have been thrilled if most of the people who showed up wanted to do makeup tutorials and Amazon hauls and productivity tips, but that’s just kind of not how it is playing out. And most of the brands that were doing these tryhard posts when I first started using the app in July seemed to have disappeared out of the algorithmic feed. And what I’m seeing in their place are a lot of journalists, pundits, maybe the odd elected official, and they’re having discussions about what is happening in real time. So I do think that puts Meta at a crossroads to decide, do we want to lean into the direction of where some of our most prominent users are guiding us, or do we want to put our foot down and build in a different direction?

kevin roose

So Adam Mosseri, the head of Threads, has been sort of — seems like he’s kind of been backtracking a little bit off this kind of anti-news or sort of, “we’re not going to focus on news” statement that he made to us earlier. In a Threads post just the other day, he said, quote, “We’re not anti-news. News is clearly already on Threads. People can share news. People can follow accounts that share news. We’re not going to get in the way of any either. But we’re also not going to amplify news on the platform. To do so would be too risky, given the maturity of the platform, the downsides of overpromising, and the stakes.” What do you make of that?

casey newton

I mean, I think that there is a way of interpreting those comments that is less about an ideological opposition to wanting to build an app that is useful for reading journalism and more is about what will make this product successful, right? Like, if I pulled you aside and I said, Kevin, I have an incredible new app to learn about all of the horrors in the world in real time, you might say, I don’t know if I need that in my life, right? But if you have this very vague statement about, Kevin, there’s a new app where people are connecting and sharing and exploring their interests, that might just have a broader appeal, right? And so I think that they don’t want to throw in the towel yet on having the broader appeal before they at least give it the old college try. What’s interesting, though, is that there is now this calamity, which has people clamoring for something very specific in a way that they just haven’t seen before. And for what it’s worth, I do think that there are a couple of things they could do to at least explore this direction without going all the way in. And it might be interesting to talk about what I think those two directions are.

kevin roose

Yeah, let’s talk about that.

casey newton

OK, so well, so what does it mean to lean into news? Right? Because I thought that Missouri got kind of undue criticism, because he didn’t say, like, don’t post news here, journalists go away. He was just like, if you think we’re going to build a ton of special features, like, this is probably not going to happen. What are those features? Well, something that people just clamor for on Threads all the time — one of those things is a trending topics page, which we actually have learned Meta is working on. It seems like that’s going to be coming to Threads very soon. People also want hashtags, because that’s a way to analyze the news in real time. And then, there’s more complicated stuff, like could there be a TweetDeck version of Threads, where —

kevin roose

Like a thing for power users who stare at it all day.

casey newton

Or could you create lists of users, so it’s like, oh, something terrible is happening in the Middle East, I know I can always get good information from these 20 people? That, to me, is an interesting question of whether Meta pursues that. And then, the other question is, like, well, let’s say they don’t do that, right? They say, to hell with it. We don’t want to get more involved with news, for all the reasons that they’ve already said. What do they do? What does a more TikTok version of Threads look like? And you know, so when I was trying to think through that, I just opened up TikTok, and I’m like, well, what’s not there? And it’s like, well, Threads doesn’t have messaging yet. It doesn’t really have a lot of creative tools. There’s — like, it doesn’t really seem like a home for short-form video. Those are all directions they could go, and it probably would be a lighter, more fun, more entertaining app. The question is just, what gets them to the billion users that they want? Is it just sort of this nebulous vision of a bunch of people having a good time, mostly not talking about the horrors of the world? Or is it something that a lot of people are telling them right now, I desperately want this, please build this?

kevin roose

Yeah.

casey newton

And by the way, I am not saying that I know which of those two things they should do. I do think that there is a possibility that if you’re just thinking about this from a sort of, like, cynical capitalist perspective, they might want to stick to their plan to just build a TikTok for text. But I don’t know, man. A lot of the most successful apps of all time — they got successful once they started to do what their users were asking them to do.

kevin roose

Yeah. I mean, I share that sense of desire for a product that lets me know what is going on in the world or where I can find good, at least sort of better-than-average information about an unfolding global conflict. At the same time, I worry when I see journalists flocking to Threads, introducing themselves, saying I’m here, this is my new Twitter, I’m going to use this the way that I used Twitter before, in part because this is just not a company that has a good track record when it comes to disseminating reliable information to a large base of users. We saw what happened when Facebook took over the news ecosystem. It was not good for Facebook. It was not good for users of Facebook. And it was not good for journalists and media organizations. It has taken a long time for the media to kind of pry itself away from the fire hose of Facebook traffic. And Facebook’s domination of the news ecosystem really did have harmful effects, especially outside the US, especially in zones with conflict and war and strife. We’ve seen a lot of the harms that have resulted from that. And so when I see journalists sort of wanting to throw their attention into another platform owned by the same people who brought us the last series of information disasters, I just think, like, what are we doing here?

casey newton

Sure.

kevin roose

Why are we trusting this company? It feels a little bit like Charlie Brown with the football.

casey newton

Well, and if what was being proposed here was, Meta was going to news organizations and saying, we’re going to give you $1 million a year to go hire some people, and we want you to post your news on Threads first, and we’ll create a special article format that only exists on Threads, and all the publishers in the world said, oh, yeah, that sounds great to us — I would agree with you. That is a bad path to go down. We’re not going to go down that path again. But I am somebody who believes that Twitter essentially discovered a huge desire. It might be niche-y in comparison to what TikTok is for today, by example, but there are clearly a lot of people who want to have that sort of, let me just scroll with my thumb, get a quick sense of what’s happening in the world. I want it to be multiple publications. I want it to be not just reporters from all these different publications, but celebrities, politicians, get all those people into one room. And as Twitter started to collapse, there were some people who said, we’ll never have it again. Like, there were these special conditions that created this, and it was just kind of a one-off. I don’t believe that. I think those people want to get back in the room. And I think over the past few days, we’ve seen them getting onto Threads.

kevin roose

Yeah, I agree with you that there does seem to be this kind of organic demand for something like the old Twitter. But I just — man, I just — we have run the experiment where Mark Zuckerberg and Adam Mosseri run the global information ecosystem. It did not end well. Right? We had ethnic violence. We had far-right authoritarians seizing power. We had, like, a global insurgence of misinformation. Meta specifically has proven that it cannot do both things. It cannot build entertaining apps that grow at a huge speed and have hundreds of millions or billions of users and distribute information responsibly. They have failed that test. And now, it drives me insane to see journalists and media organizations just, like, lining up to trust them again with such a vital task.

casey newton

Well, sure. But you know what? At the same time, journalists have done something else insane, which is they’ve bet their entire futures on Google, right? So much of the revenue pumping through the digital media economy is just people writing quick, cheap stories and hoping that they get discovered by the Google algorithm, right? And as we have talked about on the show, there is a wave of generative AI that is coming for all of those stories, and I truly am terrified that it is going to leave digital media in ruins. And if and when that happens, and more and more of those sites go away, where are people going to find their news? Right? The web that we are enjoying today truly might not exist in five years. And if that is the case, then people are just going to need a place to talk about things. And it might be that it is not Threads. I am so agnostic about whatever platform it becomes, but I do think that Threads has been positioning itself to grow fast in a way that Bluesky and Mastodon just have not been.

kevin roose

Yeah, I agree with that. I know that this is going to sound like me being like a shill for the mainstream media or a company man. But I really do think that if newspapers had never existed, and you pitched a startup that would aggregate all of the stuff that went viral on social media the day before and fact-check it and verify it through on-the-ground discovery and reporting, and then sort of rank it in order of importance, add some analysis and opinion in there, package it up and put it on your doorstep in a physical form in the morning, or on your phone or your tablet, I think that would be, like, a very popular product. I think what a lot of people are clamoring for is exactly what the media, in some idealized version of its past, was providing. Now, obviously, there are things that you can get on social media that you can’t get in the mainstream media, at least right away. And it does take some time for reporting to happen. But I really do think that what we’ve seen over the past week in this situation is just the incredible necessity of people doing professional reporting on what is going on in a global conflict.

casey newton

Absolutely. And if the question is like, would I be better off going to a newspaper homepage to get my news about this than checking social media, I believe that the answer is yes, right? At least as a starting point. At the same time, again, it is valuable to see first-person perspectives in real time on some issues, right? Think about what a lot of CNN is. It’s people just with cameras pointing cameras at things. That is a lot of what we got out of the old Twitter. So look, if you’re a publisher listening to this, thinking, what should I do, you do have an opportunity to go out and build your own distribution. You do have an opportunity to build a better product. You have an opportunity to market yourself as a better product than what people are making do with right now. I think all of that is very real. But I just also think we’re kidding ourselves if we don’t believe that there is a value in a distributed social network where people are just showing up and saying, here’s what I saw today, and here’s what I think about it. Because over and over again, we learn that there is demand for this.

kevin roose

Totally. I just think publishers should not have to choose between giving Elon Musk control of their industry or giving it to Mark Zuckerberg. I just do not think that is a choice that media organizations should make.

casey newton

Well, Kevin, where have you been getting your news?

kevin roose

I mean, so much of it has come from just mainstream media sources. I have really found myself just going back to “The New York Times” app, the “Wall Street Journal” app, the websites of local news organizations in Israel and around the conflict zone where I can read English-language reports of what is happening on the ground. It sort of feels like how I consumed news 10 or 15 years ago, before social media really took off. And it’s making me wonder if this kind of decade-long dream of the internet as a global town square, of there being these sort of gigantic central platforms where everyone went to figure out what was happening in the world, whether that dream is something that is gone. It sounds like you don’t think that is.

casey newton

No. Because what people want in times like this is not actually just the vetted, fact-checked account of what has happened. They want the conversation around it, right? They want to get some sense of how should I feel about this, how are other people feeling about this, what are the arguments that are being made, right? They want to see people speculating about what might happen next. There are all these other parts of a story that are just typically not in a mainstream newspaper story — for very good reasons, right? Newspaper stories are good at what they do, but they are only part of the solution. So unless the media is able to aggregate all of the conversation in one place, there’s just always going to be a market for these social apps.

kevin roose

Yeah, I agree with that. Yeah.

casey newton

I mean, obviously, like, which social app wins is probably the least important question about all of this. At the same time, there is a profound desire to understand important global events in real time, and what gets built will just always be of interest to us, because it is how the future is shaped — is in the places where the news is being made and distributed and being discussed. And so whatever it winds up being, whether it’s a mainstream news site that’s figured out a great new thing, or whether it’s a social app or it’s something that hasn’t been built yet, I just think it will always be of interest to us here on this podcast.

kevin roose

Yeah. Coming right up — we’re going to switch gears and talk about another way that people are starting to discover what is going on in the world — by betting on it.

casey newton

Hmm. [MUSIC PLAYING] Kevin, you did some great reporting this week about prediction markets, and it all started at something called Manifest, which — I read that and I thought, well, is this just a festival for men? Tell us about what manifest is.

kevin roose

[LAUGHS]: So this is a field trip that I had been planning for a while. This was a very fun and interesting reporting trip to a conference for what they call forecasting nerds, so people who like to predict the future and bet on the future. And this was actually something that came out of an episode that we did several months ago about LK-99. Do you remember this episode?

casey newton

Yes, of course.

kevin roose

So this was the room-temperature superconductor that a group of scientists in South Korea had claimed to have come up with. And there was this period of maybe a week or two where people were hotly debating whether this was real or not. And we mentioned on the show the existence of something called Manifold Markets, which is a prediction-markets platform where people can go and wager fake money on real-world events. And one of the most popular markets was about LK-99. And it was a way to track, like, what the smart-money people thought was going to happen and whether this prediction of a room-temperature superconductor would pan out. Now, it did not, right? LK-99 did not turn out to be a room-temperature superconductor. But I heard from one of the founders of Manifold Markets who said, if you’re interested in prediction markets, we’re actually having a big conference in a few weeks in Berkeley called Manifest, and you should come report on it. And I thought, well, that sounds like a fun trip.

casey newton

Yeah, I’d actually predicted that you were going to go to that, so that was interesting. [KEVIN LAUGHS] So you get there. And sort of describe the scene. Because what you’ve described — I’ll say it — sounds a little bit dull, but then I read your story, and it actually seemed like it might be a good time.

kevin roose

Yeah, it was a very strange event. And I say that — I had a good time and I learned a lot, but it was definitely not what I was expecting. I was expecting, like, a sort of statistics conference where people in dress shirts and Dockers would be going around, like, comparing their predictive models of the world. But it was more like a party than I thought. I described it in the article as sort of a cross between a math Olympiad and Burning Man. Like, there was actually an orgy at this conference. And I know that because there was also a prediction market asking whether or not there was going to be an orgy. I think when I got there, it was, like, 28 percent possibility, and by the time I left, someone had had an orgy and closed out the market.

casey newton

Now, that feels like leading the witness to me. And I feel like if I go into the prediction market and I say, hmm, I wonder if there will be an orgy at this party? Anybody? Anybody? And then just sort of watch the numbers slowly go up. So this is kind of one of the things that I am curious about — is, does the creation of these markets wind up influencing the events?

kevin roose

Well, yes, and I want to get there, but I think we should talk about what this idea is first.

casey newton

Oh, yeah. Tell us about what this is.

kevin roose

When we talked about it on the podcast in the context of LK-99, I believe we made some snarky comments about, oh, these are just gamblers who like to bet on everything.

casey newton

Yeah.

kevin roose

But I would say, after going to this Manifest conference, there’s also a real movement that I think is worth paying attention to here. Prediction markets — this is not a new idea, right? People have been betting on things like elections for centuries. Actually, in the 19th and early-20th centuries, it was common to open up the newspaper and see a sort of betting-odds breakdown of who people thought was going to win the next election.

casey newton

And I feel like my entire life, I’ve been hearing about the wisdom of crowds.

kevin roose

Yes. That was a very popular idea. This idea of prediction markets was sort of revived in the 1990s by a group of economists who thought, well, markets collect information. You can bet on the price of a company’s stock, or you can bet on corn futures — what will the price of corn be a year from now? You can also bet on sports games. Why can’t you bet on other things? Why can’t you bet about scientific discoveries? Why can’t you bet about policy implementation? Why can’t you bet about silly things like whether there’s going to be an orgy at a statistics conference? So there’s been sort of a real resurgence in the last few years, led by this group of people called the Rationalists. Do much about the Rationalists?

casey newton

A lot of it from reading your reporting, but yeah, tell us a little bit more about the Rationalists.

kevin roose

So Rationalists are a sort of loose collective of people who are sort of committed to examining their own beliefs. They want to get closer to the truth. Big figures in the movement are people like the guy who runs this blog, “Astral Codex Ten,” which used to be known as “Slate Star Codex.” Eliezer Yudkowsky is sort of an AI safety researcher and a prominent Rationalist blogger who started a website called “LessWrong.” So there’s a crew of people, largely based in the Bay Area but also spread out throughout the world, who are sort of doing what they would describe as rigorous empirical testing of everything that they believe and do. They love attaching probabilities to things. So I want to sketch out the vision for what they believe prediction markets could do. Because they’re not just saying like this could be a way to make money by betting right on things. They’re saying, if you have everyone betting on everything, then you end up with a system where people are incentivized to understand the truth.

casey newton

OK. So you have a bunch of people making predictions about things. How does that lead us to a better understanding of the truth or what’s going to happen in the future?

kevin roose

One example that someone at this conference brought up to me is like, imagine you have someone who’s a believer in QAnon, and they say, oh, Democrats are harvesting the blood of children. And you are a person who doesn’t believe that, who thinks that’s a conspiracy theory, and so you say, OK, I want to bet. All of a sudden, that person has to decide, like, is this something that I believe in strongly enough to wager money on it? Or is this something that I’m just sort of saying for attention? And so the Rationalists and the people who believe in prediction markets think that if you basically had to force people to put their money where their mouth is, it would moderate their views. They would back off some of their crazier beliefs.

casey newton

I mean, I would love to believe that. Unfortunately, I think a lot of QAnon believers would happily give you money, and if you showed them conclusive evidence that all of their beliefs were false, they simply would just not accept it, and then they probably wouldn’t give you their money. [LAUGHS] But have these people predicted anything interesting? Or what is their track record?

kevin roose

So the track record of prediction markets in general really depends on what kind of prediction market you’re talking about. So there’s been some research that shows that prediction markets have some utility when it comes to predicting things like elections. But prediction markets are also wrong a lot, in the same ways that some polls are wrong a lot. And I talked to a bunch of economists who basically say if you had a perfect prediction market where everyone was participating, where everyone had sort of diverse sources of information and expertise, and where all of the people with the best information were sharing that information in the form of making predictions, these things would be quite accurate. But there are a number of things that keep that from happening, right? These are very tiny platforms still. Manifold Markets, who put on this conference, has something in the neighborhood of 50,000 users, which is just very small, relative to the number of people who bet on even, like, sports games or something.

casey newton

Right.

kevin roose

And so basically, if a market is small, if the people who are in that market don’t have access to good information, and if the question is not something that can be settled with a simple yes-or-no outcome, prediction markets don’t work as well.

casey newton

Right.

kevin roose

But interestingly, I was told that this is not a new idea to the world of tech, that actually, Google has run its own prediction markets internally for employees. So if you worked at Google, you could bet —

casey newton

On whether it would become a search monopoly.

kevin roose

[LAUGHS]: Yeah, and everyone who made that bet got paid. No, it was — they used a fake currency called googles, and you could bet on things like, will this project launch in time, or will Gmail get to this many users by this date. And the company’s leaders use this as a way to gauge employee sentiment. And sort of, when people could bet anonymously, they could actually get people’s true opinions.

casey newton

Wait, that’s fascinating. And do they not do this anymore?

kevin roose

Well, they were playing around with this as recently as 2021. And there were people I talked to at Manifest who believed that this is ultimately how all companies should run. Like, you get a job at a company and a prediction market opens up that says, in a year, will Casey Newton be more or less successful than we expect him to? And everyone in the company would bet on whether they think you will succeed at your job or not. And over time, you would essentially see who is the best at forecasting people’s performance. And you could put them in charge of your hiring process.

casey newton

That sounds so unbelievably stressful. [KEVIN LAUGHS] By the way, if you are really good at the Google predictions market, and so you had more googles than anyone else, and then they shut down the market and you were stuck with all these googles you couldn’t use, we want to hear from you. I think that would make for a good story. Well, the Google story is really interesting. But it brings up something else I want to ask you about, which is the potential for people to manipulate these markets, right? You set up a market, and then you either have some insider information, or you just sort of try really hard to make the thing happen.

kevin roose

Yes, I actually saw insider trading happen. Because I was interviewing someone at this conference, and he pulled out his phone, and he showed me a prediction market that had been placed on Manifold about whether “The New York Times” would cover Manifold in an article in the year 2023. And as I was talking to him for this article, he was placing a large bet on yes on that market with his insider information, which is that a reporter from “The New York Times” was, in fact, interviewing him for an article.

casey newton

And how does the platform view that? Is it just sort of, well, all’s fair in love and prediction markets?

kevin roose

So they actually think that insider information and insider trading is good. Because people with inside information have the best information, and they can bring it to a market. They have some sort of elaborate theoretical underpinning for not believing that insider trading actually should be illegal. Right now, all of this is play money, right? Because of our gambling laws in the US, there are a couple sort of small real-money prediction markets that are very limited, and it’s not worth going into why. But most forms of real-money prediction markets are not legal in the US.

casey newton

Right. And at Manifold, they use something called mana as the virtual currency, which is also the same currency that you use to cast spells and Magic the Gathering and Diablo, so you’re going to want to manage your resources wisely.

kevin roose

Exactly. So this is this play currency called mana that you can use on the platform. They have leaderboards for who’s got the most mana. You can also convert it into charity donations. They are not allowed to pay out real money for people who are right on these gambles. And the people at this conference were upset about that. They think this should be legal. I have some concerns about that. I just don’t know what it would look like for a society to be gambling on everything all the time. But they are of the mind that the benefits of legalizing this kind of prediction market would outweigh the costs.

casey newton

You know, I got to say, Kevin, I’m of really mixed mind about this. Because on one hand, the idea of people, like, betting play money to guess what might happen seems totally innocuous. Have a good time. It seems like you had a great time at this conference, seemed like all the other people who were there did, too. But I start to hear things like, well, these folks think that insider trading should be legal, and I just start to think, keep them away from the real economy. And this whole idea that we make better decisions when we have skin in the game, I just think, has been really challenged over the past few years, right? Like, this was one of the big arguments for crypto. And crypto is the place where we used to hear all the time, you got to have skin in the game. I use — we were told for years, you can make a better social network if you have skin in the game. Right? You can develop a better relationship between musicians and fans if the fans have skin in the game. The whole idea of the Bored Ape Yacht Club was, give people skin in the game and they’ll be able to make movies. And it all just kind of came to nothing. And one of the reasons was that when you give people skin in the game and everything just has this, like, gross economic incentive tied to it, it just changes behavior. And people start, kind of, behaving in antisocial ways. So what do you think about the value of people having skin in the game? And is it possible that they’re overstating the benefits here?

kevin roose

I think it’s totally possible, and that’s a really good point you brought up. But one application of this that I actually think is kind of interesting would be, in our industry, in media — I had a conversation with the guy who runs Astral Codex Ten, and one thing that he was saying is like, if “The New York Times” put little prediction-market things at the bottom of articles, for example, that might give readers a better sense of what the probabilities behind the news events that they’re reading about are. So you could have an article about who will be the next speaker of the House, and then at the bottom of the article, you could have a little widget that sort of gave you the prediction market for someone specific or sort of an indicator of where the betting odds were on various people. And that might actually help you come to a better conclusion than just reading the article alone. Do you think that makes any sense?

casey newton

Yeah, I think you subscribe to “The New York Times,” and you’re given a certain amount of New York toobles, and then you sort of bet your toobles on who will be the next House speaker and — I mean, what that makes me think of is the way that polls would be gamed on Twitter in the heyday, right? People would say, like, hey, do you think this thing is going to happen? And then, it would get gamed as the most zealous partisans would stuff the ballot box until the poll was over. And I wonder what mechanisms might be put in place to prevent something like that from happening here. But on balance, I’m persuaded that this is an interesting technology. And one thing that I have just observed in moving through Silicon Valley is that you do just constantly meet people who are into prediction markets. You know, it’s like, along with poker, these are the two preferred forms of gambling and, increasingly, ways of socializing here in our strange little corner.

kevin roose

Totally. I mean, the first place I saw this take off was among AI researchers, who love to bet on, for example, what year we will get AGI or, like, when the first AI-generated screenplay will win an Oscar and things like that. And so they really are sort of running prediction models in their heads at all times. There’s this sort of cohort of people who are very into what they call Bayesian analysis or, like, attaching probabilities to things and living their lives that way. Do I think that is the way most people live their lives? Absolutely not. But it is sort of an interesting idea. And as someone who makes predictions sometimes as part of my job, it’s interesting to contemplate a world in which your position as a pundit or a columnist or a newsletter writer would be quantifiable in some way. Like, readers of “Platformer” could go in and say, OK, Casey’s predictions were 75 percent right last year, so I’m going to trust him more. But if his predictions fall to only 50 percent right next year, maybe I’ll cancel my subscription.

casey newton

And, like, by the way, how amazing would it be to have the pundit score that sort of said this person predicted these 50 concrete things in the past year and 12 of them happened? That feels like — that feels like the sort of information that the right person would sue to get taken off of Google.

kevin roose

Totally. But you got to spend your googles to get that taken down.

casey newton

So should we set up a prediction market?

kevin roose

Let’s do it.

casey newton

Let’s do it.

kevin roose

So I’m going to log on to Manifold here.

casey newton

You already have an account. And do you have mana in your account?

kevin roose

I do. I have 1,000 mana.

casey newton

Have you won any mana based on your bet so far?

kevin roose

No.

casey newton

OK.

kevin roose

I lost — I didn’t even bet on my own market, which was so stupid. Because I knew I was going to write an article.

casey newton

You knew you were going to write the story.

kevin roose

But I thought, this is going to get me investigated by the SEC — (LAUGHING) So I’m not going to it.

casey newton

That’s the last thing you need — is Gary Gensler at your doorstep.

kevin roose

[LAUGHS]: OK, so on the front page, you can see all of the bets that people have going on right now. There are a bunch about Israel and Hamas. There are a bunch about the House speaker, about the SBF trial, about the 2024 elections. And then, you can create your own questions. So let’s create a question here. OK. So Casey, what market should we create?

casey newton

What — well, something I’m curious about is, will Linda Yaccarino be the CEO of Twitter in six months?

kevin roose

OK. Will Linda Yaccarino be the CEO of X on April 13, 2024? We can add it to a topic. Let’s put this in Technology. And then, it says we can provide background info and details.

casey newton

Background information — Linda Yaccarino is the CEO of X.

kevin roose

[LAUGHS]: OK. Is the CEO of X — and then we have to create our resolution criteria. If she no longer has that title on April 13, 2024, this market will resolve to no. Otherwise, it will resolve to yes. So what’s your bet?

casey newton

My bet is no.

kevin roose

So we’re going to bet 100 mana on this. And that is going to move the probability by 40 percent down to just 10 percent.

casey newton

So — oh, because we bet so much.

kevin roose

Yeah.

casey newton

So there’s a sort of algorithm in the background that’s saying, because we’re willing to bet this much, it is therefore less likely that she will —

kevin roose

Exactly. And we are the only participants on this market right now. But as other people bet, the probability will move up or down, depending on whether they bet yes or no.

casey newton

Very interesting.

kevin roose

So now — oh, I accidentally bet twice.

casey newton

Well, now, is that allowed?

kevin roose

Yes.

casey newton

OK, that seems like a flaw.

kevin roose

So we’ve bet 200 mana. And now, the probability is only 8 percent. So —

casey newton

So if you’re listening to this, you’re listening to market manipulation in — this is how markets get manipulated by bad actors.

kevin roose

Yeah, that was what they call a fat finger trade in the financial business. [CASEY LAUGHS] OK, so now, we have our market up, and we can just keep monitoring it. And the idea is, behind prediction markets, that as this date approaches, there will be better and better information. And so the market will actually reflect reality maybe even more than any individual person’s opinion.

casey newton

That’s right. We might not be able to see inside of Elon Musk’s mind to know how satisfied he is with his CEO, but the wisdom of the crowds will sort of intuit his vibe.

kevin roose

[LAUGHS]: That is the idea, yes. That’s the pitch. So prediction markets — what do you think?

casey newton

Well, like I said, I think that there is clearly some value here. I think that a lot of this is innocuous fun. And I think it’s probably something that we should continue to explore. It seems like at this point, we know that there is wisdom in crowds, that the sort of aggregated opinions of a large group of people are almost always going to be better than one person’s opinion. Right? So let’s go in that direction. At the same time, do I want a bunch of gamblers running the economy or our politics? Absolutely not.

kevin roose

OK. Well, I’m going to bet against your success on every prediction market I can.

casey newton

Wow.

kevin roose

And that’s — that’s mean. I won’t do that.

casey newton

OK.

kevin roose

When we come back, we’re going to talk to a man who’s trying to make AI smell. [MUSIC PLAYING]

casey newton

Well, Kevin, this next story stinks to high heaven.

kevin roose

[LAUGHS]: I see what you did there. So this is going to be a very interesting segment. I’m very excited for this. A couple of weeks ago, I was reading one of my newsletters, and I came across this item that I couldn’t stop thinking about. And it was all about how I was being taught to smell.

casey newton

Yeah, I read the same thing. And I came to you and I said, we have to talk about this.

kevin roose

Yes. So this is a project that has been sort of incubated inside of Google but was spun out into a separate company, called Osmo.

casey newton

You might say it was stink-ubated inside of Google.

kevin roose

(LAUGHING) Stop.

casey newton

All right.

kevin roose

I’m putting a moratorium on smell-related puns and wordplay.

casey newton

Fair enough.

kevin roose

So back in August, researchers at Google and this company, Osmo, put out a paper in “Science,” showing that their AI model was basically indistinguishable from the average human at predicting odors.

casey newton

You know, sometimes I can predict what you had for dinner just using my sense of smell. [KEVIN LAUGHS] Would be interesting to compare that with what the AI can do.

kevin roose

So they created something they’re calling the Principal Odor Map. Basically, they are training an AI to be able to identify odors, not by sort of building a replica of the human nose, but by sort of mapping the relationships between different molecules and what they smell like. And this apparently has all kinds of interesting applications, everything from creating new fragrances and perfumes to possibly even being able to detect disease. So today, we’re bringing on the CEO of Osmo, Alex Wiltschko, to talk to us about their smelling AI, or smell LM, if you —

casey newton

(LAUGHING) Is this a smell LM?

kevin roose

(LAUGHING) It’s a smell LM. [KEVIN SIGHS]

alex wiltschko

Hi, there.

kevin roose

Hello.

casey newton

Hi, Alex.

alex wiltschko

Hey, how’s it going?

casey newton

Good, how are you?

alex wiltschko

I’m doing great.

casey newton

Well, first of all, you smell great.

alex wiltschko

Oh, thank you very much. Well, the thing is —

casey newton

Sure.

alex wiltschko

— we haven’t invented that yet. We’re on the road to that, so you should know that. The voice memo is going. As you could understand, I’ve got fancy candles that I can stack in order to get the recorder at the same height, roughly, as my microphone.

casey newton

And what — would you mind saying what scents those candles are?

alex wiltschko

This is called Abd El Kader. So it doesn’t give me, like, the notes of it. And then, this one — kind of basic. It’s the Santal candle, but I love it. I think it’s really, really great.

kevin roose

Nice.

alex wiltschko

So this is, like, the Le Labo classic scent.

kevin roose

If you could refer to those by their molecular structures, that would be more helpful for me.

alex wiltschko

So you didn’t tell me I needed to be in the laboratory to analyze them live and give you all the details in the readings. Now, what I did do is I got access permissions to our database, so that I can check how many molecules are more or less fruity or cinnamon than any one that we’re going to try later. So you can quiz me as I type inquiries across hundreds of millions of molecules and give you the answer of what our models say.

kevin roose

Wow.

alex wiltschko

So I’m ready to dig in.

kevin roose

So I was looking at your company’s website, and I found a blog post that you wrote, where you talk about your origin story as someone who is interested in teaching computers to smell. You talked about being obsessed with smell from a very young age. So when did your interest in scent start? And why?

alex wiltschko

So I can’t say why. I mean, because I was just born this way. Some people have a really wide-open window to the visual world or to the auditory world. And for whatever reason, my window for the olfactory world has been very open. You say, like, “carton of milk” or something like that. I can close my eyes and imagine how it feels to hold it, and I can imagine how it smells, but I don’t have any images at all. So I guess I’m just wired this way.

kevin roose

Yeah, so you said that you were a teenage perfume collector, which is very cool. But you also had an experience you wrote about with your dad, when you were in graduate school, that made you want to pursue this path.

alex wiltschko

Yeah. So when I was 24 or 25, my dad got sick, and it ended up being brain cancer. And I later learned, after many years, having kind of processed his passing, which came about, unfortunately, very quickly, that cancer has a smell. And the more that I read about this, the more I realized that many kinds of illnesses and ailments and just wellness and health states of our body have a smell. And if you look at the literature or the science, if you read all these little anecdotes that are out there, it’s clear, it’s clear, that we can detect so much more than just, did I put too much hot sauce on my eggs. There’s so much signal that’s out there. And we’re just beginning to scratch the surface. And if we’re able to give that ability to computers, beyond maybe even what we can do as humans, but also what dogs and canines and other animals can do, if we can give that ability to computers so that this ability never rests, and it always improves and benefits from the incredible ecosystem of computation, people are going to live healthier, happier, longer lives. So that’s the mission that I’m on.

kevin roose

Well, and humans are sort of famously, like, not the best members of the animal kingdom when it comes to being able to sniff things out, right? We don’t have the most developed sense of smell, relative to dogs or other animals. And so if we could use AI to improve our perception of smells, that could potentially be a very good thing in all the ways that you’re talking about.

casey newton

I could finally track my prey through the forest without having to resort to bringing a dog. [KEVIN LAUGHS]

alex wiltschko

Casey, you can do it today. So there’s this —

casey newton

Really?

alex wiltschko

— beautiful study — yes — beautiful study that if you get down on all fours and get to where the smells actually are, which is on the ground — like, we’re bipedal. We stand up very tall, and we’re far away from the good stuff. All the good smells are on the ground. So if you get down on the ground, you can track scents. Now, you’re slower than a dog. Dogs are amazing at this. But you can do it.

casey newton

Wow.

alex wiltschko

So I mean, maybe next time we get together, if we do this in person, I’ll leave a little scent trail, and we can each kind of try our hand at seeing if we can track the source.

casey newton

That sounds perfect.

kevin roose

Yeah, we now have an episode for next week. (LAUGHING) Casey goes crawling through San Francisco on all fours, identifying various scents. So let’s talk about this experiment that you all ran as part of this research that was published in “Science.” You called it the “odor Turing test,” and obviously, that’s a reference to the Turing test, which is the famous, like, can you tell if this thing is an AI or not, just based on chatting with it. But what is the odor Turing test that you set up, and how did it work?

alex wiltschko

So here’s how we set it up. We trained a panel of people to reliably rate what molecules smell like. And so the way that we did that is kind of like being handed a Crayola crayon box and being told to memorize the words on the crayon with the color of the crayon. Turns out, even for smell, you can get pretty good at that with, like, four or five, six hours of training. So what we did is we trained this panel. And then, we digitally sniffed hundreds of thousands of molecules that were on a large database. And so we predicted the smells of all these hundreds of thousands. We kept our predictions secret. And then, we selected this group of 400, sent them out to our panelists, and they smelled them and rated them. So that’s how all really big AI systems are trained — is you collect lots of data from lots of people. And when you need high-quality data, you average people, or you have them adjudicate somehow. So the best you can do is the average of the panel here. And every person in the panel has some distance to the panel mean. Some panelists are closer to the panel mean, some are further away. And our model most of the time was closer to the panel mean than the median panelist, which is, in my view, an early form of passing the Turing test.

casey newton

Do you think someday, you’ll be able to make an app that’s a Shazam for smell? So if I’m walking through the world, I’m like, hey, what is that exactly, it’ll just be able to tell me?

alex wiltschko

100 percent. I mean, that’s — we know how to do that, and it’s something that we’re working on the fundamental technology to actually enable. And then, if we can take that readout, and then replay that smell, maybe with the same molecules that we detected, maybe with totally different ones. And that means we’ve fully roundtripped a smell. So those are all steps on a staircase that are in front of us. And we’re starting to climb up them right now. But that’s what’s ahead of us.

kevin roose

That’s fascinating. Well, it’s a very interesting project, and I will be very interested to see what the next steps in your research and development are. But right now, you have actually given us a quiz. You’ve mailed us a kit that is similar to the ones that the people who participated in your research got. And Casey and I are ready to take the odor Turing test. Are you ready, Casey?

casey newton

Yeah, let’s see if we can pass the smell test.

kevin roose

All right. So Alex, you have sent us a Osmo’s Sniff Test. Casey, here’s your copy. So this is a sheet of paper explaining what we’re supposed to do, along with some samples of some of these odors. So here’s our little kit here. So basically, this is testing how our ability to detect these smells is, compared to the AI model, as well as to Osmo’s master perfumer. So we are going to — first of all, we have to reset our noses. Have you ever reset your nose before?

casey newton

I don’t think I have.

kevin roose

OK, so it says we have to smell our elbow pit, our inner elbow. This is a prank.

casey newton

It very much feels like a prank.

alex wiltschko

No, that’s a pro move. I’ve worked with perfumers a lot and been in a lot of smelling sessions, and people just smell their skin.

kevin roose

Wow. OK, so my nose has been reset.

casey newton

Thank god I took a shower today.

kevin roose

OK, so now, we open the vial labeled 427-3, and we smell this. And then, we have to write down at least three words to describe it. OK. So I’m going to open this up and take a little whiff.

casey newton

OK. All right. I am now also taking a whiff.

kevin roose

Now, I have a bad sense of smell, so I’m not going to do well on this test, I’m afraid.

casey newton

Hmm. That’s hard.

kevin roose

So I’m going to write down my words. You write down your words.

casey newton

Yeah, what were your words for the first one?

kevin roose

OK, my words were “grape,” “violets,” and “purple,” which is not actually a smell.

casey newton

You have synesthesia. I wrote down “green apple,” “white wine,” “flowers.”

kevin roose

Wow. We are so different. OK. So here’s number two. OK.

casey newton

Now, this one is on a strip, rather than a vial.

kevin roose

Yes.

casey newton

Oh, I’ve had this cocktail. What is this?

kevin roose

Casey, what did you write down for number two?

casey newton

I’m so wrong. That’s — I’ve literally had that cocktail, and I just don’t know what it is. But I wrote down “lime,” “simple syrup,” “strawberry.” I’m just, like, groping around for, like, what is the cocktail that I’ve had that has whatever that is in it.

kevin roose

One of us is really bad at this, because I wrote down “bourbon,” “wood,” and “cayenne pepper.”

casey newton

Oh, interesting.

kevin roose

Now, number three.

alex wiltschko

Wait, reset your nose.

kevin roose

Oh, reset nose. OK.

casey newton

By the way, if you’re listening, feel free to reset your nose along with us at home.

alex wiltschko

Everybody, reset your nose. It’s time to reset your nose. [CHUCKLES]

kevin roose

They call this an ol-factory reset.

casey newton

(LAUGHING) That is an ol-factory reset. All right.

kevin roose

All right. Here we go. This is a small vial with some yellow stuff in it, called — labeled 400.

casey newton

Mm.

kevin roose

Mm. OK. I’m getting some — OK, I’m not going to tell you what I’m getting yet. You have to come up with your words.

casey newton

Don’t prime me, bro. Yeah, that was another — I have another set of wrong answers for you on that one.

kevin roose

(LAUGHING) OK, what did you guess?

casey newton

I wrote down “sandalwood,” “bergamot,” “pepper.”

kevin roose

OK, I wrote down “meat” and “tomato sauce.” OK, so we have last one. This is number 41. Oh, I can get this one.

casey newton

OK.

kevin roose

No, I can’t.

casey newton

This just smells like the first one.

kevin roose

OK, so for this one, I got “moss,” “mildew,” and “forest.”

casey newton

It’s beautiful. And the random tokens I’ve generated would include “fabric softener,” “lilacs,” and “the first one.”

kevin roose

(LAUGHING) OK. OK. So we have guessed our four. Now, we are going to open the envelope containing —

casey newton

The envelope, please!

kevin roose

— the correct answers. Would you like to do the honors?

casey newton

Yes, I will. Now, and these answers were actually prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers. [KEVIN LAUGHS] (LAUGHING) And they’ve been kept in a locked briefcase. And the first set goes to — the first one was —

kevin roose

Wait, this was the one that we guessed. So remind me what you guessed for number one.

casey newton

First one, I guessed “green apple,” “white wine,” “flowers.”

kevin roose

And I guessed “grape,” “violets,” and “purple.”

casey newton

OK. The Osmo AI descriptors were “fruit,” “pineapple,” and “sweet.”

kevin roose

So I got close with grape. That is a fruit.

casey newton

Yep.

kevin roose

Yeah.

casey newton

OK.

kevin roose

OK.

casey newton

Number two, I had “lime,” “simple syrup,” “strawberry.”

kevin roose

And I had “bourbon,” “wood,” and “cayenne pepper.”

casey newton

OK. Osmo AI says “floral,” “spicy,” “sweet,” and “green.” Green, interestingly, not a smell. So how do you explain that, Alex?

alex wiltschko

Green is definitely a smell. It’s like fresh-cut grass. It’s like all the plant-y type things.

casey newton

Plant-y type things. OK, all right. Interesting. The master perfumers described it as floral muguet? Do you this word?

alex wiltschko

Muguet — it’s a little flower with little bell-type flowers. It smells like dryer sheets. Like, dryer sheets are the smell of muguet now.

casey newton

Yes. Now that you say it, number two was definitely giving dryer sheets. So that resonates with me. So other descriptors for that one include “anise,” “apple,” and “pear,” and I think it was the pear that was making me think it was a cocktail so much.

alex wiltschko

Anise in, like, licorice can — like, that’s often in cocktails. What’s interesting about our predictions is, anise actually wasn’t one of the labels that the model knew about. So it did the next best thing, which is spicy.

kevin roose

Huh.

casey newton

Hmm. Interesting.

kevin roose

I was getting spicy. OK.

casey newton

Yeah.

kevin roose

That’s good.

casey newton

All right, number three — I had “sandalwood,” “bergamot,” “pepper.”

kevin roose

And I had “meat” and “tomato sauce.”

casey newton

OK, I feel like we’re at least in the right zone. The Osmo AI described it as “leathery,” “earthy,” and “tobacco.”

kevin roose

OK.

casey newton

And the master perfumers described it as “saffron,” “fruity,” “leather,” “black tea.”

kevin roose

Wow.

casey newton

So if we’d gotten leather, we would have really —

alex wiltschko

You were definitely in the ballpark there. Now, my wife used to sell saffron, and so she knows the saffron flower very well. And when she smelled it first, she’s like, holy crap, not only is it saffron, it’s the specific part of the flower.

kevin roose

Oh, wow.

casey newton

And this molecule is definitely not in the flower. So it’s like — it’s a totally new molecule, but with smells that exist elsewhere in the world. It’s just —

kevin roose

So they can make fake saffron now that will only cost, like, $100, as opposed to $300, at the grocery store.

casey newton

Well, for this molecule, you’ll bring along a little leather and tobacco, which maybe doesn’t fit with your risotto or the dishes you might want to use it in.

kevin roose

That’s true. That’s true. I hate when leather taste gets in my risotto. OK. What’s number four?

casey newton

Number four —

kevin roose

This is the one where I had “moss,” “mildew,” and “forest.”

casey newton

And I famously had “fabric softener,” “lilacs,” and “the first one.” And Osmo described it as “woody,” “herbal,” “fresh,” and “mint.” And the master perfumers described it as “woody,” “patchouli,” and “sage.” So if we spend a little bit more time in the Lower Haight with the Grateful Dead in the ‘60s, maybe we would have gotten this one.

kevin roose

[LAUGHS]: All right. So Alex, how did we do, compared to your average panelist in your study and your AI model?

casey newton

Well, actually, I think I can answer that, Kevin, because we didn’t get one right. [KEVIN LAUGHS] So I think that gives us a rough sense of how we did. But yeah, Alex, anything to add?

alex wiltschko

I’m going to step in, and you’re going to get very strong partial credit on number one. You got the fruit, right? And some people do perceive 427-3 as having kind of like that grape or red berry kind of a thing. And then, I think you’re in the ballpark for 400, right? You’re getting the kind of earthy aspect to it.

casey newton

Yeah.

alex wiltschko

And then, I think, Kevin, you get partial credit for being in the woods for 41.

casey newton

Yeah.

kevin roose

Yeah, Casey.

casey newton

Well, congratulations on your partial credit, Kevin.

alex wiltschko

And this is with — this is the first time that y’all are doing this. I mean, that’s incredible. This is not easy stuff, right? And I can see the gears turning as well. Like, it actually is kind of like — it’s hard. Like, you have to use your brain to pull the words out of your mind as you smell things.

casey newton

Yeah, you know what this is really making me think of, Alex, is Kevin and I need to spend more time stopping and smelling the roses. [KEVIN LAUGHS] Because then maybe we’d do better at your quiz.

alex wiltschko

Yeah. Oh, absolutely.

kevin roose

And then ultimately, we can train an AI to smell the roses for us and put ourselves out of a job, so.

casey newton

Exactly.

alex wiltschko

What kind of a job is it to stop and smell the flowers? It’s the slice of reality that now you get to enjoy. Why would you outsource that?

casey newton

I mean, I feel very few people have a job that is closer to stopping and smelling the roses than the job you have, Alex.

alex wiltschko

I love it. It’s my favorite thing in the world.

kevin roose

All right, Alex Wiltschko. Thank you so much. Really, really appreciate you coming on.

casey newton

And Alex, I’ve always wanted to say this to a guest — smell you later.

alex wiltschko

Smell you later. Kevin, Casey, thanks so much. [MUSIC PLAYING]

kevin roose"
575,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/opinion/israel-gaza-war-peace.html,"I am fighting the feeling that there are few paths left to try.

Last week, as war broke out in my home, I was in Armenia, spending hours talking to people whose own lives have been wrecked by war. In September, thousands of people from Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-populated enclave inside Azerbaijan, were driven out by Azerbaijan’s lightning military assault. In a crumbling, Soviet-era kindergarten hastily repurposed as a shelter, people told me about their overwhelming sense of loss. One man just kept repeating, “Homeless, homeless, homeless.”

War is all around us. Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Sudan, Israel: These aren’t just names, these are people’s lives. Some places, like Nagorno-Karabakh, in the far corners of the South Caucasus, are tragically easy for the world to forget, until they explode. Others, like Israel and Palestine, are always on the world’s mind, and they also explode.

Hamas’s savage attack was a shock — but not a surprise. We have all watched peacemaking fail here, as it often does. This isn’t just a crisis for grass-roots peace activists, it’s a grand failure on a global stage. Lately the whole notion of solving conflicts, containing violence through international rules and institutions, the international system itself, appears wholly inadequate to the task of protecting people and preventing wars.

One could be forgiven for asking, what international system? The global institutions so painstakingly built over decades seem to be no match at all for the things that really run the world: money, oil, arms, interests. The Armenians feel betrayed by the international community for its near-complete inaction in the face of Azerbaijan’s punishing, nine-month blockade on Nagorno-Karabakh since December, which left 120,000 people — mostly civilians — lacking enough food, medicine or fuel. The United Nations sent its first mission to the enclave in 30 years only after most Armenians had been driven out by the violence. Azerbaijan, too, was frustrated for nearly 30 years by the impotence of international law as seven additional areas of its sovereign territory conquered by Armenia during the 1990s war over Nagorno-Karabakh remained under control of Armenians.

Israel has scoffed at international law for decades by expanding settlements, annexing territory conquered in war, and suffocating the civilian population in Gaza through a 16-year blockade, with few repercussions. Countries that don’t like international courts — including the United States — largely ignore them. Vladimir Putin will probably avoid prosecution for his invasion of Ukraine. Hamas certainly had no concern for international prosecution or for the fate of the liberal rules-based world order when it slaughtered over 1,300 Israelis. Much of the world will view Israel’s unfolding and brutal retaliation — so far, more than 400 Palestinian children have been killed, according to the Palestinian health ministry — as justified."

“This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,” he said in a statement accompanying the bank’s quarterly earnings. He warned of “far-reaching impacts on energy and food markets, global trade and geopolitical relationships.”

On Friday, he said he was preparing the nation’s largest bank for a range of scary outcomes, with other risks including high inflation and rising interest rates. But on a call with reporters, he described the conflict in Israel and Gaza as “the highest and most important thing for the Western world.”

It came as Israel’s military said that its troops were preparing “for the next stage of the war.” The country has called up 360,000 reservists, and Israel has warned that, after the massacre of its citizens by Hamas on Saturday, the rules have changed. “Every Hamas member is marked by death,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.

In Gaza, the humanitarian crisis deepened after six days of Israeli bombardment of the crowded, blockaded territory in retaliation for the brutal incursion by Hamas, the Palestinian militant organization that controls the enclave. U.N. officials have warned that people in the territory are experiencing “horrible” suffering as they face a “huge disaster.”

581,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/12/opinion/israel-palestinians-gaza-peace.html,"Throughout this horrible week, my mind has repeatedly flashed back to Dec. 23, 2000. That was the day the Palestinians were offered a path to having their own nation on roughly 95 percent of the land in the West Bank and 100 percent of the land in the Gaza Strip. Under that outline, Israel would also swap some of its own land to compensate the Palestinians in exchange for maintaining 80 percent of its settler presence in the West Bank.

The Palestinians would control, in President Bill Clinton’s formulation, “Arab areas” of East Jerusalem. And on the most sensitive religious sites, there would have been divided sovereignty or jurisdiction, with Palestinians controlling the Haram al-Sharif (including the Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques) and Israel controlling the Western Wall and the holy space of which it is a part. There would also be a return of many refugees into the new Palestinian state (without the right of return to Israel itself).

There were a million complexities — and many errors made by the Israeli, Palestinian and American sides along the way. But this offer pointed the way to the sort of fair solution negotiators had been struggling their way toward for years. It is hard to see this kind of option ever being on the table again. And the Palestinians let it slip away.

This memory comes hauntingly back because the misery that Palestinians and Israelis are now enduring did not have to happen. They could have reached some kind of moderately effective arrangement, which would have given the two nations a chance to pursue their own destinies."
582,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/12/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-protests-national-security.html,"Monitoring for threats involves sifting through rhetoric online and looking for information that indicates a specific plan, like details about a time and place, and assessing whether any purported plotters have the capability to carry out an attack, a Homeland Security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said during a call with reporters on Thursday evening.

Since the Hamas attacks on Israel on Saturday, U.S. counterterrorism officials have been reaching out to thousands of state and local law enforcement officers and religious leaders to discuss the potential impact of the attacks inside the United States. This includes sharing intelligence and offering guidance and assistance in shoring up security at mosques and synagogues and other public gathering places where people could be at risk.

On Thursday, officials from the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security and the National Counterterrorism Center held a call with about 4,000 law enforcement officers from around the country, a homeland security official said. The official, who was authorized to speak only on condition of anonymity to share sensitive details, said participation was extraordinarily high, an indication of the broad sense of urgency on security issues around the country.

“The reality in which we are gathered today is this: Jewish people in our country and across the world are again traumatized, again afraid for their own safety and for the safety of their loved ones,” Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the Homeland Security secretary, said on Thursday during a speech to a group of sports leaders hosted by the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism.

Hate crimes against Jewish people and institutions in the United States were already on the rise, Mr. Wray said, and had continued to do so since the Hamas attacks. Over the weekend, Mr. Wray said, the F.B.I. relayed a tip about threats to some faith-based community centers, including a Jewish Senior Services Center in Connecticut."
583,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/12/opinion/israel-hamas-isis-gaza.html,"Put all this together, and you can immediately perceive Israel’s asymmetric challenge. Hamas scorns the law of war. The reports of its intentional mass killing, mutilation, rape and civilian hostage taking are evidence enough of that fact. Israel legally and morally obligates the Israel Defense Forces to comply with the law. As a result, civilians become one of Hamas’s principal military assets. The presence of civilians gives Hamas the ability to punch first in any given street fight. The presence of civilians raises the bar for approving airstrikes or any other use of long-range weapons. And when civilians die, Hamas uses their deaths to inflame the international community and to help run out the clock on international patience for Israeli military operations.

Even worse, Hamas is helped by an enormous amount of public ignorance combined with outright misinformation. The average journalist — much less the average citizen — doesn’t know much, if anything, about the laws of war. Let’s take, for example, two key legal concepts that will be relevant every single day of the fighting in Gaza: proportionality and distinction.

As the war continues and as the destruction mounts, you will hear a number of voices condemn Israel for a disproportionate response, but many of these critics fundamentally misunderstand what proportionality means in the law of war. The U.S. Army’s “Law of Land Warfare” field manual — which is deeply grounded in the international law of armed conflict and governed our urban operations in Iraq and Afghanistan — defines the legal obligation of proportionality as requiring “commanders to refrain from attacks in which the expected loss or injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects incidental to such attacks would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained.” It also requires that commanders “take feasible precautions to reduce the risk of harm to civilians, other protected persons and civilian objects.”

Proportionality does not require the Israel Defense Forces to respond with the same degree of force or take the same proportion of casualties as Hamas. In addition, as the manual states, “the proportionality standard does not require that no incidental harm results from attacks.” If you’re a soldier on patrol and someone fires at you with a rifle, you don’t have to respond with a rifle. You can use a tank round or a missile in response, unless you have reason to believe the tank round or missile will cause extraordinary collateral damage. But if you’re taking fire from a single house, proportionality prohibits you from destroying the entire block. Throughout the war on terrorism, American forces used powerful, longer-range weapons to attack individual targets. That does not violate the laws of war.

In reality, inflicting disproportionate casualties can be one of the goals of a fighting force. Ukraine appears to have inflicted substantially greater casualties on Russia than the Russian Army has inflicted on Ukraine. That doesn’t mean Ukraine’s response was disproportionate under the law of armed conflict. In every fight, the goal is to inflict as many losses as possible on your opponent while taking as few losses as possible."

Video from the aftermath of the strike showed a scene covered in gray ash and dust, the bodies and wounded nearly indistinguishable from the rubble around them.

The Gaza Strip, pounded for days by hundreds of Israeli airstrikes in retaliation for Hamas attacks on Saturday that killed more than 1,200 people, is on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe, residents and aid workers say. The strikes, along with a newly declared siege by Israel, have compounded the problems of years of blockade that had left the strip, a tiny enclave controlled by Hamas, impoverished and desperate even before the latest war.

“We are facing a huge disaster,” said Adnan Abu Hasna, the media adviser for the U.N. agency that helps Palestinian refugees.

Gazans and Israeli officials alike have described the strikes, which began on Saturday, as more severe and widespread than in conflicts past. Satellite imagery of residential areas showed dozens of flattened buildings, and video showed the wreckage of a refugee camp hit by a strike.

As Israeli troops moved toward the border with Gaza before a possible ground invasion to dismantle Hamas, a U.N. official warned of a humanitarian “disaster” in the blockaded territory.

Six days of Israeli bombardment have left more than 300,000 people homeless, and there was no immediate sign that emergency relief would be allowed in. Israel has pummeled the 140-square-mile Gaza Strip, already under a 16-year blockade, with airstrikes of a magnitude and intensity not seen in its past assaults.

The Gazan Health Ministry said that 1,417 Palestinians had been killed and 6,268 others had been injured. The ministry also warned that the health system “has begun to collapse.” Gaza’s sole power plant stopped generating electricity yesterday for lack of fuel, shutting off lights, refrigerators and other devices, and much of the region lacks running water.

587,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/12/us/politics/biden-israel-economy.html,"It is the conundrum of a foreign policy president in a domestic policy environment. At times like these, Mr. Biden spends more of his typical day on matters thousands of miles away, especially the war in Ukraine and now the war in the Middle East. But his message to constituents has remained focused on matters he believes are more directly of concern to their lives at a time when polls show most voters do not approve of his economic stewardship.

In addition to the junk fee event in the Rose Garden on Wednesday, Mr. Biden met at the White House on Thursday with corporate executives to talk about his economic policies. He plans to fly to Pennsylvania on Friday to deliver a speech about creating jobs and transitioning to a clean energy future, to be followed by a similar trip to Colorado on Monday.

“President Biden doesn’t need to be reminded about the importance of domestic policy,” said Jon Meacham, a presidential historian who has helped form some of Mr. Biden’s signature speeches. “He knows that presidencies aren’t single-front undertakings but are at least two-front wars: the work at home and the protection of our interests abroad — and, of course, the two are often interconnected.”

Mr. Meacham cited Franklin D. Roosevelt confronting the Depression at home and the rise of fascism in Europe, Dwight D. Eisenhower grappling with integration in Little Rock, Ark., and the Sputnik challenge from the Soviets and John F. Kennedy dealing with clashes over civil rights in the South and the missile crisis in Cuba.

But the experience of a more recent president demonstrated the hazards of being seen as too focused on the outside world. George H.W. Bush successfully managed the end of the Cold War and the prosecution of the Persian Gulf war of 1991, but lost re-election in 1992 when voters thought he was not paying enough attention to a recession afflicting them."

The House is now under the control of Representative Patrick T. McHenry of North Carolina, who was named as the temporary speaker after Republicans dumped Representative Kevin McCarthy as speaker last week. But Mr. McHenry is unelected and primarily in place to oversee the election of a new speaker, and his legislative powers are untested. The position second in line to the presidency remains unfilled.

The infighting has consequences far beyond Capitol Hill. Here is a look at the big tasks Congress faces as Republicans remain deadlocked.

An aid package for Israel for its war against Hamas.

There is a broad bipartisan consensus on the need to rush additional military support to Israel for its war against Hamas. But the leadership vacuum means there is no certainty about how soon any aid could be approved and delivered. President Biden said in a speech on Tuesday that he would seek approval from Congress for additional funding for Israel, and officials in the administration have suggested a specific request could come within weeks.

Their families found refuge and built new lives in America, starting businesses, joining mosques or churches, enjoying a sense of freedom and stability.

But all that time, their new country has remained a proud ally of Israel’s government, which many Palestinians see as an oppressive, occupying force.

“I cannot understand the double standard of this country,” said Zein Rimawi, a Palestinian who immigrated to the United States in the 1980s and lives in New York City, where he founded a mosque. Mr. Rimawi said he was troubled by the way U.S. leaders were supportive of Ukraine’s fight against Russia, yet, in his view, unable to understand the perspective of Palestinians.

In interviews with more than a dozen Palestinian Americans, many said they were saddened by the violence against civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian, and hoped for a peaceful resolution. But many said that the underlying causes of the conflict could be traced to the policies of Israel and the United States, and decades of Palestinians being denied freedom of movement and basic rights."

The harrowing scenes have been playing out on a seemingly endless loop at Al Shifa Hospital since Saturday, when Hamas, the group that controls the strip, launched a deadly assault on Israel — and Israel’s military retaliated with punishing airstrikes on the blockaded enclave.

Al Shifa Hospital is the Gaza Strip’s largest medical complex. Many of the limestone villas and high-rise buildings surrounding the hospital in its affluent Gaza City neighborhood of Al Rimal have been reduced to piles of rubble and concrete.

Russia, for its part, has said that Israel’s war in Gaza shows the failure of the West and in particular U.S. policy in the region.

The trading of accusations illustrates how, nearly two years into Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the two countries are seeking to nurture their diplomatic alliances and influence opinion to bolster their respective military causes.

The latest example came on Thursday, when Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, accused Moscow of sending weapons to Hamas that Russian forces had captured on the battlefield in Ukraine. He said this was an apparent attempt by the Kremlin to discredit President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government by making Israel think Ukraine was supporting Hamas.

“We know for a fact that trophy weapons from Ukraine were transferred by the Russians to the Hamas group,” Mr. Budanov said in an interview with Ukrainian Pravda published on Thursday. It was not possible to independently verify the claim, and Mr. Budanov did not provide evidence for it."

That was a hope born from the early days of digital, when too many techno-optimists believed that amateur documentation could dissolve political deadlocks, reveal the truth of war, even topple governments.

But the digital camera would lose its innocence in the wars of this century. By the mid-2010s, when so many of us gave up on the chronology of news broadcast for the algorithmic distribution of the social feed, digital images of war fell into the same trap as every other variety of political information: The pictures you like could be amplified, and the others could be dismissed as fake news.

“All hoped,” Dr. Stein writes, “that these new cameras could bear truer witness and thus yield justice as they saw it. Most would be let down.” The very framework of picture-making had been absorbed into the conflict, and indeed the most graphic pictures of corpses we have seen this week — Israel said that its death toll had risen to 1,200, and Gaza health officials reported that more than 1,400 Palestinians had been killed so far — are not neutral records. They are weapons like other weapons, for a time when violence is no longer confined to battlefields.

The full-scale conflict that is already underway in Israel and Gaza is an asymmetric war, between one of the world’s best-equipped armed forces and an Iran-backed militant group. Well, we have learned over the past few years that digital photography is an asymmetric medium too — where a livestream can trigger a protest, a cameraphone witness can outmatch a professional broadcast, and not even the clearest picture is any match for ideology. The lesson we are condemned to relearn is that the photograph, and the digital photograph especially, does not just derive its meaning from what it depicts; it comes from how it travels, how it mutates, and who determines the trajectory. And there is a second and grimmer lesson: Even when it shows the most horrific violence, you cannot ask a camera to make sense of it."

An estimated 260 people were killed in that attack. We later found out Hersh and his friends managed to escape by car but the vehicle came under rocket fire. They were forced to stop and take cover in a roadside bomb shelter. Terrorists then attacked the shelter, blowing off Hersh’s arm from the elbow down by machine gun fire or a grenade or both.

According to witnesses, Hersh, a 23-year-old American-born U.S. citizen, was then ordered into a pickup truck by armed Hamas terrorists and driven toward the Gaza border. The police told us the last known location of his mobile phone was on the Gaza border early Saturday afternoon.

I don’t know if he is dead or alive or if I will ever see him again.

The only thing I know is that this is not the fate that Hersh or any of the captives, among whom are several other Americans, deserves. I am heartbroken, but the messages of support pouring in from near and far make this moment heartwarming at the same time.

I wept this morning receiving messages from his friends in Bremen, Germany, which is home to SV Werder, the team that has a friendly relationship with Hersh’s beloved Hapoel Jerusalem soccer team. He befriended these German fans over the years when they visited Jerusalem to watch their team play soccer. Together they painted a peace mural with both Arab and Jewish residents near our home in Jerusalem, where we’ve lived since Hersh was 7. Just five weeks ago, Hersh spent time with these friends in Germany.

The outreach from these German friends resonates with me especially because Hersh is named after my grandfather Harold and my great-uncle Hershel, who was killed in the Holocaust. It was beautiful for me to be reminded, through these friendships, that for young Germans and Jews particularly, the world that Hersh has lived in has recognized and worked to overcome the terror experienced by my great-uncle."

More than two million Palestinians are trapped inside Gaza, about half under the age of 18, as Israel pounds us in retaliation for Hamas’s surprise attack on Saturday, with the United States promising “surging” military support.

Apartment complexes in Gaza City have been leveled, houses bombed and families annihilated. I can’t even recognize the upscale Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City — it’s been so thoroughly damaged. At least 326 children in the Gaza Strip have been killed since Saturday, according to the Ministry of Health here. Women and children from my extended family were killed in an attack on Tuesday, and my cousin was killed on Wednesday. The smell of explosives permeates the entire strip. Yoav Gallant, Israel’s minister of defense, called us “human animals” and announced that the suffocating siege that Palestinians in Gaza have endured for more than 15 years would be tightened even further: The strip is now cut off from food, electricity and fuel.

No electricity means no internet or connection to the outside world. Raw sewage is seeping into Gaza’s streets; waste treatment facilities require electricity. The water supply has been cut. Driving south on Monday, I passed five United Nations schools-turned-shelters, so jampacked with displaced people that families spilled out into the yards. Dread grows inside me, as I know the worst is yet to come.

Over 2,300 Israelis and Palestinians have been killed so far, the majority of them civilians. I am saddened by the killing of all civilians. I know that the pain of an Israeli parent is no different from the anguish of a mother or father in Gaza. Yet I’m not surprised that we have found ourselves at this bloody point of no return.

Many of the fighters who breached those walls are probably just a few years older than Ali; many of them were born during the second intifada. Their entire experience has been Israeli military occupation, siege and devastating military assault upon assault in an enclave of 140 square miles, with unemployment and poverty rates of approximately 50 percent. This is the history, and these are the conditions that have shaped so many in Gaza, not a justification. Israel helped create these fighters by starving them of hope, dignity and a future."

The bus is “crackling with flames.” There are screams and shouting. The children burn inside. The crash happened a few minutes’ drive away from a settlement and seconds from a checkpoint. An Israeli ambulance could have bypassed the checkpoints and taken a direct route to the scene of the accident. But about half an hour in, Thrall writes, “not a single firefighter, police officer or soldier had come.”

One starts to question whether the tragic accident is a failure of bureaucracy or, instead, whether it is the bureaucracy. Politics is not just elections and war. It is also neglected infrastructure, separate roads, suspicious soldiers. How much do individual choices matter under a system that determines the daily routines, the course of one’s life and even one’s death?

Thrall is one of the few writers who can combine vivid storytelling with in-depth analysis of the occupation without resorting to political throat-clearing, and throughout the book he maintains an unwavering, cleareyed focus on the broken political system. His view of the occupation is long: This is his second book on a subject he has covered for more than a decade. He is an authority on the history of the border wall and the politicians who intentionally built “apartheid roads,” and his expertise allows him to shuttle nimbly between the viewpoints of frantic families and Palestinian leaders as well as Israeli officials and nearby settlers.

At times, the book can feel repetitive, especially when Thrall restarts the day from various vantage points. In the second half, we lose the thread on Abed as Thrall takes us into the lives of other parents desperately searching for their children. But the images that flash in these parents’ minds — the Spider-Man backpack, the chocolate milk — are powerful testaments to the basic fact that it was children who died.

Thrall’s book forces readers to focus on a difficult and yet obvious fact: Young Palestinians are intractably tangled up in an enduring conflict. Every year, the Israeli military court sentences hundreds of children to prison time for throwing stones, many of them 12 to 15 years old. As Thrall notes, “The damage wasn’t only to the affected families, each of them grieving lost years and lost childhoods. It was to the entire society, to every mother, father and grandparent, all of whom knew or would come to learn that they were powerless to protect their children.”"

Let’s hope that Israel responds to this outrage more wisely than we in the United States did to the attack on our country.

There’s a lot of loose talk about eliminating Hamas, and Hamas deserves it. As a journalist who has traveled repeatedly to Gaza, I’m appalled by the sympathy that some Americans and Europeans have shown for a misogynist and repressive terror organization like Hamas. If you care about human rights, you want to see Hamas eliminated.

Yet dismantling terrorist organizations can be harder than it looks and can raise troubling moral questions about collateral damage. The Taliban also deserved elimination, yet in the end it was the United States that was eliminated from Afghanistan. I worry that Israel may charge into Gaza with a ground invasion as thoughtlessly as we plowed into Iraq."

“People were crying for the children they had to leave behind under the rubble,” Mr. Ahmed, 32, said. “They were begging us to go in and pull their children from the rubble — this was all they wanted, for us to go and pull their children out.”

Israel launched a wave of airstrikes on Gaza after gunmen from Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that controls the Gaza Strip, crossed the border on Saturday, massacred Israeli soldiers and civilians in their homes, and fired thousands of rockets toward Israeli towns and cities."

Yet China’s stakes in the Middle East are high, particularly if the war now being fought in Israel and Gaza were to broaden through the region.

One big reason: oil.

No country buys more oil from Saudi Arabia, the world’s second-largest producer behind the United States. Half of China’s oil imports, and a little more than a third of all the oil burned in China, comes from the Persian Gulf, according to Andon Pavlov, the lead refining and oil products analyst at Kpler, an analysis firm in Vienna.

China has also started buying more oil from Iran, a longtime backer of Hamas, the group behind the attack. China has more than tripled its imports of Iranian oil in the past two years and bought 87 percent of Iran’s oil exports last month, according to Kpler, which specializes in tracking Iran’s oil exports."

Yellen said on Wednesday that the Israel-Gaza war was a potential concern for the global economy and signaled that additional U.S. sanctions could be coming in response to the attack on Israel by Hamas.

Questions about the economic impact of the war were growing as Ms. Yellen offered a forceful defense of Israel and pushed back on the notion that U.S. sanctions against Iran — a key backer of Hamas — have become too lenient. Ms. Yellen said the Treasury Department continued to review its sanctions on Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group that is also a longtime adversary of Israel.

“We have not in any way relaxed our sanctions on Iranian oil,” Ms. Yellen said at a news conference on the sidelines of the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Marrakesh, Morocco. “We have sanctions on Hamas, on Hezbollah, and this is something that we have been constantly looking at and using information as it becomes available to tighten sanctions.”

She added: “We will continue to do that.”

The Treasury secretary also did not rule out reversing a decision made last month — to unfreeze $6 billion of Iranian funds in exchange for the release of American hostages — if it is determined that Iran was involved in the attack by Hamas."
605,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/11/opinion/israel-9-11-biden-strategy.html,"Twenty-one years ago, in the shadow of the Sept. 11 attacks, George W. Bush warned of an “axis of evil,” encompassing the authoritarian and anti-American regimes of Iraq, Iran and North Korea. He did not claim that they were actually allies or partners in the style of Nazi Germany and imperial Japan. What made them an axis, in his rhetoric, was simply their ample cruelty, their shared pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their potential willingness to share such weapons with groups like Al Qaeda.

The Bush address was a classic post-9/11 speech, inflating the real dangers of pariah regimes via a dubious World War II analogy, forced through with bluster rather than defended by specifics. Many members of Bush’s team had spent their formative years focused on great power competition, and they preferred to conceptualize the war on terrorism in terms of enemy regimes that could be coerced or changed. This didn’t really make sense; there wasn’t actually an axis of culpable state actors for us to go to war with after Sept. 11. But the desire for one, the imagining of one, helps explain how Al Qaeda’s attacks led to our disastrous invasion of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq.

Two decades onward, we can see that in this great squandering of American power, our leaders helped create in 2023 the kind of landscape that Bush imagined facing back in 2002. The 9/11 attacks did not reveal a world where the Pax Americana faced serious threats from rival powers. But the world of last week’s Hamas attacks, an equivalent trauma (at least) to Sept. 11 for Israel, is very different: From the American perspective, the crisis in the Holy Land must be analyzed in terms of great power politics and the pressure we face from broadly aligned rivals — Iran, Russia and China — on three fronts at once.

To be clear, we do not know yet whether the Hamas attacks were planned with Tehran’s blessing or connivance. But the fact that Iranians have in recent years increased funding and support for Hamas means that the attacks flowed in some way from Tehran’s grand strategy — its desire to surround Israel with enemies, to extend its power through allies and proxies and to disrupt the American attempt to mediate a rapprochement between Israel and the Sunni Arab states."

A famous 1967 declaration by the University of Chicago called for institutions to remain neutral on political and social matters, saying a university “is the home and sponsor of critics; it is not itself the critic.” But students over the years have frequently and successfully pressed their administrations to take positions on matters like police brutality, global warming and war."
607,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-american-deaths-hostages.html,"Read the latest updates about the Americans missing and killed.

White House officials said on Tuesday that 14 American citizens were killed and 20 or more were missing after the brazen attack on Israel, which President Biden condemned as an act of “pure unadulterated evil.”

Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, told reporters on Tuesday that it remains unclear how many of the missing were in the hands of Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls Gaza and carried out the attacks that began on Saturday morning and have killed more than 1,000 people in Israel.

Mr. Sullivan said the government was in regular contact with the families of the missing, some of whom have pleaded with authorities in the United States and Israel to help find and bring back their loved ones.

“I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world,” President Biden said in his speech from the White House on Tuesday.

U.S. officials had not shared identities of any of the missing or dead Americans, but based on media and family reports, many appeared to be dual U.S.-Israeli citizens, with family in both countries, at least some of whom lived in small agricultural communities near the border with Gaza that came under attack from Hamas.

The missing: Family members plead for help

At a news conference in Tel Aviv, Nahar Neta fought back tears as he described being on the phone trying to calm his 66-year-old mother, Adrienne Neta, who was born and raised in California but living in a kibbutz near the border with Gaza as Saturday’s attack unfolded.

His siblings were on the phone with her as attackers broke into her home in Be’eri, he said. They heard screaming, he added, and have not heard from her since.

Rachel Goldberg said she woke up on Saturday in Jerusalem to the sound of sirens warning of incoming rocket fire. Her 23-year-old son, Hersh Golberg-Polin, was at a music festival near Gaza’s border. When she turned her phone on 10 minutes later, she saw two consecutive text messages from him that read “I love you” and “I’m sorry.”

Mrs. Goldberg — who moved with her family from California to Jerusalem in 2008 — has not heard from her son since. She said the only thing the police could tell her was that his last known cellphone signal was near the border with Gaza.

Also among the missing Americans were a mother and daughter from Evanston, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, who were visiting relatives in Nahal Oz, a kibbutz less than a mile from the Israel-Gaza border. Rabbi Dov Hillel Klein, the executive director of Chabad of Evanston, said Judith Raanan and her teenage daughter, Natalie, who recently graduated from high school, had not been heard from since Saturday.

“This was a woman that was full of hope,” Rabbi Klein said of Judith Raanan. “And I know she has a resilience to overcome her tormentors.”

The lost: A mother shielded her son from bullets

In her final moments, Deborah Martias, who was born in Missouri and whose father is a longtime professor at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, covered her teenage son with her own body to protect him, her relatives told several news outlets on Tuesday.

In the moments before she and her husband were killed by the assailants who burst into the family’s home, Ms. Martias was on the phone with her father, Ilan Troen, he recounted in a televised interview, saying that she heard glass breaking, gunshots and people speaking in Arabic.

In an email to The New York Times, Mr. Troen, who also teaches at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, said that he was heading to a hospital in Israel to visit his 16-year-old grandson, Rotem, who had been shot in the stomach but survived, hiding until he could be rescued.

Mr. Troen described his daughter and son-in-law in the interview with MSNBC as “idealists.” They lived at Kibbutz Holit, a small community just over a mile from Gaza, and had sent their children to a school that taught both Hebrew and Arabic, he said, “in the hope that somehow Jews and Arabs would learn to understand more about each other,” and “change the course of history here.”

Israel said its military had regained control over its border towns yesterday as it continued to hammer Gaza with airstrikes, reducing some buildings to rubble.

President Biden, in a televised address to Americans from the White House, pledged military assistance to Israel, including rockets to replenish its Iron Dome interceptor system. He said that 14 U.S. citizens had been killed, and called Hamas’s actions “pure unadulterated evil.”

Biden added that the U.S. would help provide intelligence to save Hamas-captured hostages, who include American citizens, but did not suggest that U.S. troops would assist directly. Hamas, which is believed to have taken around 150 Israeli hostages since Saturday, threatened to kill a captive each time Israel struck Gaza without warning. Hamas confirmed that two of its senior officials had been killed by strikes.

Israel approved the call-up of an additional 60,000 reservists, raising the total number mobilized so far to 360,000, the most in such a short period since the country’s founding. It is not yet clear if or when Israel will order a ground invasion of Gaza."

After leading Israel for nearly 16 years in total and priding himself on bringing the country prosperity and security, Mr. Netanyahu, 73, now confronts the vivid failure of his own policies toward the Palestinians — presiding over what many Israelis are calling the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust.

The Hamas breakout from Gaza and incursion into Israel proper, killing hundreds of civilians as well as soldiers, is all but certain to mark Mr. Netanyahu’s legacy no matter the outcome of the fierce war he now promises against Hamas.

On Tuesday, under pressure to do so, Mr. Netanyahu struggled to try to negotiate a unity government that included some of his main rivals, most of them experienced military officers.

Past the village dining hall, kindergarten and culture center, the tidy rows of one-story beige houses came into view. And the scale of the horror began to unfold.

Four days after hundreds of Hamas gunmen breached Israel’s border fence in the most brazen attack on the country in decades, overrunning two dozen towns and communities, including this one, in a bloody killing spree, soldiers and rescue workers on Tuesday began the gruesome task of extricating the bodies.

They moved slowly, house to house, for fear that Hamas gunmen could still be hiding inside or have booby-trapped them. Live grenades lay in wait, to be neutralized by sappers. They carried out one slain resident in a body bag on a stretcher and placed it in the back of a truck. Then another. And another.

The announcement by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Monday that Gaza would receive “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” after a major incursion by Palestinian gunmen left hundreds dead has led aid agencies to warn of an exacerbated humanitarian crisis.

Under the longstanding blockade, the densely populated strip, with more than two million residents, nearly half of whom are under 18 years old, faces severe restrictions on the movements of goods and people.

Most commodities in Gaza, from foodstuffs to construction supplies, are imported from Israel through official border crossings, according to the United Nations. Gaza gets most of its electricity via Israeli power lines, and produces some at a power plant in Gaza with fuel imported from Israel. It receives a smaller number of goods through its much shorter border with Egypt.

Electricity shortages are chronic, with power often available for only 12 to 15 hours per day. That undermines health services, water pumping and purification and the area’s fragile economy, aid workers say.

Movement of people in and out of Gaza was heavily restricted before the attacks, with Israel and Egypt granting small numbers of people permission to travel, mostly for work or medical care.

On Saturday, after Palestinian gunmen began their assault inside Israel, the Israeli authorities stopped supplying electricity, leaving Gaza’s residents with only about three or four hours of power per day, according to the United Nations’ humanitarian office, which said Gaza’s power plant might soon run out of fuel.

Now, Israel has closed both of its crossings with Gaza, the Kerem Shalom Crossing for cargo and the Erez Crossing for people.

“Before things were restricted, now they are blocked entirely,” said Tania Hary, the executive director of Gisha, an Israeli nonprofit that focuses on free movement of Palestinians in Gaza.

Humanitarian officials said that a complete blockade would create more severe suffering for Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

“Overwhelmed hospitals treating thousands of wounded will now have to do so without reliable access to electricity,” Mahmoud Shalabi, a senior program manager for Medical Aid for Palestinians, a charity based in the U.K., said in an email.

Egyptian officials have not said whether Israel’s announced siege of Gaza would affect their policy toward the movement of goods and people in and out of the territory.

Gaza’s border with Egypt remained open with limited traffic on Tuesday, and truckloads of food, construction material, fuel and emergency medical supplies entered over the weekend. But Egypt also heavily controls the movement of people and goods across its border crossing, opening and closing it in response to security conditions.

Even if Egypt left its crossing open, experts said, it could not fill the gaps left by the complete closure of Israel’s crossings. In 2022, some 32 percent of goods entering Gaza came from Egypt, Gisha said in a report."

That paved the way for a potentially raucous and drawn-out G.O.P. election on Wednesday morning and suggested that the House might go without a new speaker for days as the party worked through its rifts.

Asked what the chances were that the House would select a new speaker by Wednesday as scheduled, Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, said: “I’d put it at 2 percent.”

A week after a far-right faction forced former Speaker Kevin McCarthy from his post, fewer than half of House Republicans had publicly announced their support for either of the leading candidates to replace him: Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the party’s second-ranking leader, and Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the Judiciary Committee chairman."

Some Republican members of the U.S. Congress have argued against continued support for the government in Kyiv, while Slovakia recently elected a political party that expressed support for Russia during its campaign. At the same time, Poland’s objections to the movement of Ukraine’s agricultural exports through its territory have cooled the relationship between the two allies.

“Russia is interested in triggering a war in the Middle East, so that a new source of pain and suffering could undermine world unity, increase discord and contradictions, and thus help Russia destroy freedom in Europe,” Mr. Zelensky said in the speech released overnight.

Motorists were killed on the outskirts. And at a grisly scene by an entrance to the city, there is another group of slain civilians. At least two white trucks - one equipped with a rear mounted machine gun - Entered and drove along Menachem Begin road, a main thoroughfare through the city. Seven people waiting at a bus stop on the road were gunned down. Two more were killed in a van and a car around the corner and 100 yards from there. A motorist and a motorcyclist were found dead. One resident captured the terrorists approaching the police station. The gunmen opened fire on a passing police car. Others are filmed moving along a residential street, kicking doors and shooting at a passing car. At least nine assailants on foot approached the police station and exchanged gunfire with officers. From the opposite direction another group of attackers charges towards the fray, flanking the police station. One resident filmed police defending the station entrance. One officer is shot and dragged away. As officers move forward to engage the attackers. Another rescues two children from a car.

At Congregation Beth Elohim in Park Slope, Brooklyn, a Reform synagogue, Rabbi Rachel Timoner has long criticized the Israeli government and its occupation of Palestinian territories. Just weeks ago, she recalled in an interview on Monday, she delivered a Rosh Hashana sermon that described loyalty to Israel as “standing with Israelis against this government.” It drew a standing ovation, she said.

But an hour before she was set to deliver another sermon on Saturday morning, reports emerged of the attack by Hamas, the Palestinian faction that controls Gaza. She quickly understood, in the midst of her horror, what her message must be.

“Now is a time to stand unequivocally with Israel and Israelis,” she recalled telling her congregants, “and to say to our Israeli family that we are grieving with them, and we are praying now that Israel will defeat Hamas.”

Rabbi Motti Seligson, a spokesman for Chabad, a global network of strictly observant Jewish congregations, said he was celebrating the Jewish holiday of Simhat Torah in Brooklyn on Saturday with visitors from Israel — some of whom had to travel home and report for military duty after the attacks."

Ms. Kurtzman, a modern Orthodox Jew, typically leaves her phone off on Saturdays but turned it on when she realized something was wrong. The barrage of rockets and sirens continued for longer than usual.

“We’re used to hearing the missiles, we’re used to hearing the Iron Dome, we’re used to hearing even planes and tanks and helicopters, but this was the first time we heard gunshots right outside our window and we understood that something is going on — that the terrorists are nearby,” Ms. Kurtzman, 28, said.

“Sadly, American taxpayer dollars helped fund these attacks, which many reports are saying came from the Biden administration.”

— Former President Donald J. Trump in an Oct. 7 statement

This is false.

Soon after the Hamas attacks on Israel, former President Donald J. Trump and other Republicans tried to cast blame on President Biden — saying that a recent deal brokered to secure the release of five Americans detained in Iran helped to finance the assault. Iran is a longtime backer of Hamas, a Palestinian militant group that has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States.

As part of the deal in question, the U.S. facilitated the transfer of $6 billion of Iranian profits from oil sales from banks in South Korea to Qatar so that Iran could use it for food and other humanitarian purposes.

But that $6 billion is not U.S. taxpayer money, as Mr. Trump and others, including Vivek Ramaswamy, another of the Republican presidential candidates, falsely stated. Nor is there evidence that the money, which officials have said is subject to Treasury Department oversight, was used to finance the attacks."
627,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/08/world/middleeast/hamas-military-gaza-explained.html,"Hamas, an armed Palestinian group, launched one of the largest assaults on Israel in decades on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, taking more than 220 hostages and leading Israel to declare war. The largest of the armed Islamist groups in the Gaza Strip, Hamas governs that Palestinian territory, home to two million people.

What is Hamas?

Hamas was founded in 1987 by Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who was active in the Muslim Brotherhood, during the first Palestinian uprising against the Israeli military control of the West Bank and Gaza.

Hamas has since been responsible for suicide attacks against Israeli civilians, and the kidnapping and killing of Israeli soldiers. The United States is among the countries that have deemed it a terrorist group. But Hamas is also the governing power in the Gaza Strip, and has been since 2007.

Unlike the Palestine Liberation Organization, led by Mahmoud Abbas, Hamas does not recognize Israel’s right to exist as a state and has spoken about driving all Jews from the region. It has advocated an uncompromising position on the creation of a Palestinian state based on Islamic fundamentalism stretching from the Mediterranean east to the Jordan River."
628,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/us/politics/biden-middle-east-diplomacy.html,"In the short term, at least, Mr. Biden’s sweeping aspirations will have to take a back seat to managing the clash now consuming Israel and Gaza, one unlikely to be resolved as quickly as the bursts of violence that have periodically erupted over the years. The Hamas strike represented the most extensive invasion of Israeli territory in decades, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could feel compelled to send ground forces into Gaza to exact retribution and rescue hostages.

In a brief televised statement on Saturday, Mr. Biden condemned the Hamas attack as “unconscionable” and called his support for Israel’s right to defend itself “rock solid and unwavering.” He warned against escalation by unnamed others, almost certainly meaning Iran. “This is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage,” he said.

But as he huddled with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and other advisers at the White House and consulted long distance with Mr. Netanyahu and King Abdullah II of Jordan, Mr. Biden did not indicate publicly how far he thought Israel should go in responding to the attack, nor did he speculate on how it would affect his broader goals for the region.

The president’s Republican opponents wasted no time turning the conflict in Israel into an attack line against Mr. Biden. Led by former President Donald J. Trump, Republicans asserted that the administration’s recent hostage deal with Iran had enabled Hamas’s actions. “Sadly, American taxpayer dollars helped fund these attacks, which many reports are saying came from the Biden administration,” Mr. Trump said in a statement.

In fact, no American taxpayer dollars were involved in the hostage deal. The Biden administration signed off on the release of $6 billion of Iranian oil revenue frozen in South Korea and decreed that it be kept in a bank in Qatar available only for humanitarian purposes. Officials said Saturday that none of that money had been spent."

It’s easy to note the parallels between Hamas’s attack on Israel on Saturday morning and the Yom Kippur War, which began 50 years ago Friday.

Now, as then, Israel seems to have been taken almost wholly by surprise by an enemy whose capabilities it appears to have badly underestimated. Now, as then, Israelis have sustained losses — at least 600 dead, over 2,000 wounded and dozens of hostages taken — that go far beyond anything they suffered in recent years. Now, as then, there looms the prospect of a wider and deadlier war — the last time with the Soviet Union, this time with Iran and its proxies in Syria and Lebanon.

Now, as then, Israel’s military, intelligence and political leaders can soon expect hard questions about their failure to anticipate this attack. The Yom Kippur War helped end the Labor Party’s iron grip on power in Israel. This war might yet do the same for the Likud’s.

There are parallels on the Arab side, too. Like Egypt’s and Syria’s in 1973, Hamas’s aims in this war almost surely have strategic purposes that go beyond killing, maiming and terrorizing Israelis."

The bodies of Palestinian fighters returned to Gaza from Israel filled the morgue at the Shifa Hospital, where by afternoon there was no space left inside the refrigerators and corpses were laid out on the floor. But more bodies and injured fighters continued to arrive, as did families of the dead.

The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said that 198 Palestinians had been killed and 1,610 wounded. Yousef Abu al-Rish, the top Palestinian health official in Gaza, said that most of the casualties resulted from clashes inside Israel."

The blockade restricts the import of goods, including electronic and computer equipment, that could be used to make weapons and prevents most people from leaving the territory.

More than two million Palestinians live in Gaza. The tiny, crowded coastal enclave has a nearly 50 percent unemployment rate, and Gaza’s living conditions, health system and infrastructure have all deteriorated under the blockade.

Israel says the blockade is necessary to stop the flow of arms into the territory, but Palestinians and aid groups say it is collective punishment and exacerbates dire economic and social conditions."

That war also began on the Sabbath, with sirens wailing across the country on Oct. 6, 1973, on Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar.

On Saturday, many Israelis had been planning to celebrate the holiday of Simchat Torah. Instead, the armed wing of Hamas, the Islamic group that controls Gaza, fired thousands of rockets toward Israel. Simultaneously, reports flooded in of a major breach of Israel’s fortifications along its border with Gaza, the Palestinian coastal enclave that Israel and neighboring Egypt have kept under blockade for 16 years, citing security reasons."

Now that the post-Cold War has expired, the post-post-Cold War that we’ve entered is just begging to be named. So here goes: It’s the age of “That Was Not the Plan.”

I know, I know, that doesn’t trip off the tongue — and I don’t expect it to stick — but boy is it accurate. I stumbled across it on a recent trip to Ukraine. I was speaking with a Ukrainian mother who explained that since the war started, her social life had been reduced to occasional dinners with friends, kids’ birthday parties “and funerals.” After typing her quote into my column, I added my own comment: “That was not the plan.” Before last year, young Ukrainians had been enjoying easier access to the E.U., embarking on tech start-ups, thinking about where to go to college and wondering whether to vacation in Italy or Spain. And then, like a meteor, comes this Russian invasion that turns their lives upside down overnight.

She is not alone. A lot of people’s plans — and a lot of countries’ plans — have gone completely haywire lately. We’ve entered a post-post-Cold War era that promises little of the prosperity, predictability and new possibilities of the post-Cold War epoch of the past 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall.

There are many reasons for this, but none are more important than the work of four key leaders who have one thing in common: They each believe that their leadership is indispensable and are ready to go to extreme lengths to hold on to power as long as they can."

This was the question addressed to the 11th Athens Democracy Forum, against a backdrop of war in Europe, unchecked climate change, galloping inflation and the A.I. revolution with its specter of “robots with glaring red eyes,” as Nick Clegg, the president of global affairs for Meta, put it.

Mr. Clegg dismissed those sinister visions — A.I. can slice and dice vast amounts of data, he pointed out, and is adept at pattern recognition but does not even know the meaning of the words it uses. Fear has always accompanied the arrival of new technologies, but the worst is far from inevitable.

The Greek economy has surged from the desperate state it was in a decade ago. The weather was overcast and cool, with no hint of the climate extremes Greece has experienced of late. The war in Ukraine drags on and takes a terrible toll, but the front lines have scarcely moved in a year. Perhaps attendees of the forum could be forgiven for feeling intimations of imminent global cataclysm are overblown.

Still, there was no consensus on hope. Democracy has taken a beating in recent years with the rise of autocratic states and attacks around the world on a free press and independent judiciaries. Democratic societies have suffered from self-satisfied blindness to their eternal fragility and from acceptance of forms of injustice — especially growing inequality — that undermine consensus. Even the claim of democracy to the moral high ground is now questioned, a theme that was consistently aired in Athens."

I am left-wing, and I certainly do not share any ideology with the right-wing settlers. But I do totally empathize with the rage currently felt here in Israel. It is time to “take the gloves off.”

Thomas L. Friedman underestimates the barbarism (his word) of Hamas. He claims that a two-state solution needs to be part of Israel’s retaliation. It was always apparent that not long after the Oct. 7 massacre Israel would lose the public relations war. The horror would be news for only a few days. Social and mainstream media would move to the next series of headlines, the unfortunate and horrific consequences for the average Palestinian in the subsequent war.

While Gaza and the West Bank are inextricably linked, contending that the response to the barbarism must be accompanied by a solution to a problem that has been unresolved for ages is impractical and unrealistic.

Hamas has no interest in a peaceful solution. Its antisemitic barbarism reaffirmed that it wants no state of Israel in any form.

Re “Do We Treat Palestinians as Lesser Victims?,” by Nicholas Kristof (column, Oct. 22):

Mr. Kristof does not mention that Hamas hides in and underneath crowded civilian settings, including mosques, hospitals and schools. Israel does not deliberately target civilians. Hamas, on the other hand, purposefully targets Israeli civilians (and holds hostage Israeli babies, the elderly and everyone in between), and uses Gazan men, women and children as tactical pawns and human shields.

In such a case, civilian casualties are tragically unavoidable. Mr. Kristof, I appreciate your reminder of the sanctity of human life, but how would you suggest Israel proceed when its enemy does not consider this a value? Indeed, it is Hamas who is putting Gazan civilians at risk.

Bina Westrich

To the Editor:

In urging readers to reject the “hierarchy of human life” purportedly embedded in support for Israeli military action, Nicholas Kristof attacks a straw man. No serious defender of Israel’s response to the Oct. 7 massacres argues that the lives of Israeli children are worth more than those of Gazan children. To the contrary, they argue that a failure to destroy Hamas now — leaving it capable of and eager to repeat similar atrocities — would result in far more death, destruction and human misery (for both Israelis and Gazans) than the admittedly terrible civilian costs of a full-scale Israeli incursion.

And if we are calculating human costs, we had best consider the consequences of Mr. Kristof’s proposed policy: If democratic nations adopt a policy that terrorists who butcher innocents render themselves invulnerable by shielding behind a civilian population, it is not just Israeli or Gazan children who will suffer. It is everyone’s children.

One cannot read Mr. Friedman’s sage advice on the current conflict between Israel and Hamas without hoping that the leaders empowered to make a decision are listening. Mr. Friedman articulates why a ground invasion of Gaza will only empower Israel’s enemies and ultimately lead to even worse conditions for Israel.

Frustrating the goals of Hamas and Iran while stabilizing the balancing relationships with Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, and saving countless lives in the process, makes perfect sense. Unfortunately, it will require that the leaders of these countries make decisions that are bigger than themselves, and run counter to the emotions of the day.

Benjamin Netanyahu will need to subvert the desire for revenge felt throughout Israel and embrace the path to a Palestinian state, ending the expansion of Jewish settlements.

King Abdullah II of Jordan, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia will need to take a stand for a more secure future in the region and lead their people beyond the cries to support Palestinians and punish the Jews.

Re “The Work of Moral Rebuilding Must Begin Now,” by Peter Beinart (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 15):

Mr. Beinart expresses outrage at the savagery of Hamas terrorists against Israeli civilians. At the same time, he outrageously proposes that what set the stage for the horrific displays of Hamas savagery was the failure of the international community over the years to support Palestinian nonviolent resistance, such as the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.

This conveniently whitewashes the fact that many supporters of B.D.S. and other forms of Palestinian resistance reject Israel’s very legitimacy and recognition of the Jewish right to nationhood. These activists see resistance as a means toward Israel’s complete elimination, and call for a refusal to engage with Israel — all of which provide the backdrop to the bloody massacre of more than 1,400 Israelis, most of them civilians, on Oct. 7.

What is needed now is a true commitment to nonviolence, one that speaks to viable peace, a recognition of Israel’s right to exist and ultimately two peoples living side by side with security.

Israel has every right to forcefully respond to Hamas’s brutal, unconscionable and inhumane attacks. But Israel may be engaging in its own form of barbarity.

Stopping the supply of water, food and fuel, forcing Palestinians from their homes and starting a huge ground invasion are also profoundly wrong. Killing Palestinian civilians, including children, while hundreds or thousands of Israeli soldiers are also killed, solves nothing.

Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran and others have made no secret of wanting to destroy Israel. Any nation (including the United States) would react if attacked by a neighboring entity, especially one aiming to destroy it.

In attacking Gaza, however, Israel most likely will lose in the American and world court of public opinion — and ultimately could lose United States backing, a disaster for Israel. It might not survive without it.

The substantial increase in antisemitic acts being committed in the United States and other countries contributes to this worrisome dynamic.

I have always been an Israeli peace advocate: in favor of a two-state solution and Israel’s Labor Party; against settlement expansion, Benjamin Netanyahu and Likud.

Before my retirement in 2005, I was on the steering committee of the National Interfaith Initiative for Peace in the Middle East. I lived in Israel for a year. My wife and I have visited many times. We have decades-long friendships with Israelis who are part of the peace movement.

I care about the innocent lives being lost on both sides. It is, however, the Oct. 7 vicious acts committed by Hamas, the taking of hostages and Hamas embedding itself within civilian housing, including at least one of Gaza’s major hospitals, that have caused the loss of lives in Gaza.

The headline of Mr. Kristof’s moving column, pulled from a direct quote from a young Gaza woman, is a devastating and accurate assessment of the carnage that continues in an area that has seen more than enough suffering in multiple centuries.

Mr. Kristof’s stellar journalism is rooted in his ability to collect poignant voices of those directly affected by humanity’s shortcomings. Politicians, diplomats and any citizen who would like to see a cease-fire and to see international law respected should heed what a Gaza teenager stated about her horrible inheritance: “It’s like we are overpaying the price for a sin we didn’t commit.”

This wise statement is applicable to all the civilians and innocents, Israeli and Palestinian, who are caught in the crossfire of one of the thorniest and deadliest geopolitical issues of the modern era.

Mr. Kristof wraps this poignant piece up by admitting that he does not have all the answers, but he does pose an important question: “What policies will reduce the risk, not inflame it, while honoring the intrinsic value of Palestinian life as well as Israeli life?”

We can only hope that the major political players work diligently to answer that question so the Middle East and the greater world move toward a lasting peace and not the nihilistic destruction that is unbearable for those trapped there.

We pray that Palestinians and Israelis and their respective leaders and all of the people who empathize with them will remember that in the midst of righteous anger, ill-conceived actions can make matters much, much worse for everyone.

To the Editor:

As an American Jew, I am horrified by President Biden’s response to Hamas’s horrific murder of Israelis on Oct. 7. By providing military aid to Israel, the U.S. government is fueling the Israeli government’s vastly disproportionate response, in which it has already killed more Palestinian civilians than Israeli civilians were killed by Hamas.

Mr. Biden may have urged the Israeli people not to be consumed by the rage they feel about the Hamas terror attacks, but that statement is completely contradicted by his sending the very weapons that the Israeli military is using to kill civilians.

The U.S. can stop this immoral violence, but instead is fanning the flames by providing support for the autocratic Israeli government. I am joined by many other American Jews in condemning the Israeli government’s killing of thousands and threatening millions of innocent lives in the name of the Jewish people.

To the Editor:

In this time of unbelievable misery and loss, it may be naïve to talk about international law. But some of the participants in the current fighting in Israel (and their allies) have represented that they are trying to respect the laws of war. Since many observers may not be familiar with those laws, I write simply to report two indisputable principles.

First, the same rules of conduct apply to the “aggressor” and to its victims. “They started it” is no excuse for doing things that would otherwise be illegal.

Second, the fact that the overall objective is permissible (like self-defense) or even laudatory does not excuse using methods that result in disproportionate harm to civilians.

Applying these principles, it is a violation of the laws of war to knowingly cut off food, water, fuel and medical supplies to entire trapped localities. The harm would fall disproportionately on civilians who have even less access to whatever supplies exist than those in authority. It cannot be justified.

As an American Israeli living in Israel with a son in the Israel Defense Forces, I feel that I must speak out.

It was uplifting for Israelis to hear President Biden’s remarks after the attacks on Oct. 7. Israelis everywhere felt encouraged by the president’s unequivocal support, and the unambiguous message that the events of Oct. 7 constituted “pure, unadulterated evil” — because they truly did.

It is clear to Israelis that in carrying out these atrocities, Hamas was seeking to draw Israel into precisely the actions that Israel is now engaged in. The justification for those actions could be debated endlessly, but the world must know that Israel considers itself in existential peril. And in our hour of trial, we derive incredible strength from American support.

The objective of Israel’s war with Hamas is not the suffering of Gazans or Palestinians but the crippling of a murderous terrorist organization that has caused unprecedented suffering for Israelis and Palestinians alike.

Re “Turning Our Moral Compass to Suffering on Both Sides,” by Nicholas Kristof (column, Oct. 12):

Mr. Kristof points out the dangers of urban warfare in Gaza. However, he neglects to mention one of the dangers Israel faces as it responds to Hamas’s barbarism: Israel being wrongly blamed for the death of innocent Palestinian civilians who are accidentally killed because they are being used as human shields by Hamas.

Israel usually provides warnings to Palestinian civilians before it attacks, even though it decreases the chance of operational success and comes at the expense of Israeli lives. When Palestinian civilians suffer in Israel’s justified response to Hamas’s attack, it is imperative to place the blame on Hamas — the government that commits a war crime by using its own people as a shield.

Nicholas Kristof warns Israel to act with a “moral compass” and “humility” before engaging in a ground siege of Gaza. He cites Rabbi Jonathan Jaffe, who wrote that when the world starts complaining about such use of force, Jews won’t care.

I know Rabbi Jaffe (he is my rabbi), and he is generally liberal and progressive. Mr. Kristof should realize that the old paradigm has completely shifted now, a direct result of the absolute amorality of Hamas’s slaughter. Many of even the most liberal of Jews understand that after this display of inhumane carnage, the usual mores that guide rational actors are secondary to considerations of basic survival. This is what Israel now faces."

This inexcusable and horrific attack by Hamas has been a long time coming. It is the symptom of Israel’s disregard for Palestinian human rights and international law, which watchdogs like Amnesty International are constantly reporting on.

Like many other Israelis, I received a call telling me to immediately report for duty after the attack. All reservists know this call, which comes without any notice and could instantly change your life.

A decade ago, during Operation Protective Edge in Gaza, I served as a military doctor. The same day that the United Nations announced a cease-fire, I found myself in the twilight near the Gaza border in a field that burst into flames. My brigade’s medical armored personnel carrier had been hit by a rocket. Five soldiers, most of them medics, died while fiercely defending our sovereignty.

The latest escalation in the region brings us to the verge of another military ground operation. It seems that our enemies mistakenly decided to take advantage of the rift in Israeli society."

But as a Jew who only wants Israel to thrive, I have for decades been distraught over Israeli government policies that both diverge from Jewish ethics and also create the misery and despair that inevitably produce Palestinian violence.

The Israeli government, quite reasonably frightened by Arab rhetoric and actions, has enforced conditions in Gaza as bad as any ghetto our people endured. This new horror is the entirely predictable result, and surely demonstrates that “security” that is enforced by an iron fist is not security.

It takes two to tango. Can both Israeli and Palestinian leaders now finally listen to those of their two peoples who even now seek peace and reconciliation, and get past their mutually well-founded fear and anger to reach for something better? However hard that is to imagine, it is the only way forward out of this dire swamp.

Hundreds of Israelis have been killed and untold numbers kidnapped — including women and children abducted at gunpoint — and taken to Gaza as hostages and human shields. Hamas’s unbridled barbarity shocks the conscience of the world.

Re “To Prepare Kids for the Future, Bring Back Shop,” by Pamela Paul (column, Oct. 13):

Ms. Paul hit the woodworking nail on the head. Children need to do more physical and practical work at school, and schools need to integrate more movement into students’ routines.

As a teacher at a school where classes are held almost entirely outside, I’ve seen that when we give children the opportunity to do meaningful and purposeful physical work, they are more grounded, collaborative and creative.

Attending Back to School Night at my son’s middle school, I was saddened to see that instruction is done mostly via large screens and that the students have no recess.

There is a lot of justified concern about the well-being of adolescents, but how can we expect to have a society of physically and mentally healthy young people if we don’t give them a chance, as Ms. Paul says, to move their bodies and let their minds wander?

Cooking was equally thrilling. How fun and satisfying to learn to bake brownies for my family! That eighth-grade class developed a lifelong love of cooking and baking.

When Trump’s Words Incite Violence"

In “One Reason the Trump Fever Won’t Break” (column, Oct. 2), David French argues that since today’s Christian nationalists are theologically inarticulate, they must be driven by “emotion, prophecy and spiritualism.” This misunderstands the way religious traditions work.

Like other religious movements, today’s white Christian nationalism is fueled by habits of heart and mind that have been passed down from generation to generation, which is to say they are historically and theologically grounded.

These habits include a racialized view of America as a caste society, an unshakable suspicion that government elites are conspiring against us, the fear that those beyond our border are intent on doing us harm, and the conviction that the United States is an instrument of divine purpose, “the greatest nation on earth.”

These religious habits can be traced to the very origins of the English colonial experiment in North America. They have always been a part of American culture, and we should not be surprised that they continue to shape our public life today.

Pretending that Christian enthusiasm for Donald Trump is just some kind of mass psychosis or mob mentality may allow some Christians like Mr. French to feel better about themselves and their churches. But they need to confront a deeper truth: There is something compromised at the core of the white American Christian tradition.

David French’s column was well written and analytical, but it did nothing to stop me from shaking my head at the biggest contradiction in American politics today: Why does the religious right love Donald Trump?

Mr. Trump is amoral and irreligious. His personal and business lives are full of actions, such as multiple marriages and liaisons, allegations of infidelity and questionable business ethics, that mock evangelical behavior. He flaunts his personal, business and legal challenges. In short, his life story is everything that traditional evangelicals should be expected to abhor.

The only explanation is that Mr. Trump and evangelicals have a symbiotic relationship that puts both in positions of power and influence. Regardless, that fact still flies in the face of the traditional honest fervor that motivates conventional religious people. I would like to see additional columns that explain why the Trump-evangelical bond won’t break anytime soon.

While the article accurately portrays some of the fears invoked by these dangerous attempts at doxxing at Harvard, the damage has extended even further than described. As a member of the class of 2021, I’ve heard from several classmates who were included in the doxxing list yet have not been associated for years with the student groups that signed onto this statement holding the “Israeli regime” responsible for “all unfolding violence.” Others who appear on the doxxing list are indeed active members of one of the groups, yet had nothing to do with their leadership’s signing onto the statement.

This is the logical consequence of such McCarthyite tactics: They provide no opportunity for the accused to respond.

Bill Ackman, the hedge fund billionaire who urged that the names of students be circulated to avoid hiring them, and others should be ashamed of themselves for allowing a recent Stanford undergraduate to determine the fates of students partly through “tips sent to an email address.”

We in the U.S. must end the silencing of dissent about Israel’s actions. The nonviolent Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement to force changes in policies of forced removal of Palestinians must be honored as a legitimate tactic instead of being labeled antisemitic.

We must learn to listen to the legitimate opinions that the U.S. should not be complicit in Israel’s colonial-settler policies, just as we must listen to the demands for a cease-fire, an end to military aid and a space where Palestinians can represent themselves in diplomatic avenues.

It strikes me that the students at Harvard who complain about being “doxxed” misunderstand the concept of free speech. Free speech means that you are free to say whatever is on your mind “free” of government restrictions. It does not mean that your speech is free of consequences.

If you open your mouth and say something stupid, people will naturally think you’re stupid. If you say mean things, they likely will think you mean. And if you act as an apologist for terrorists, people will understand you to be an apologist for terrorists.

My heart goes out, and I cry over the suffering of Palestinian children in Gaza. They have done nothing to deserve war after war after war.

However, to ignore Hamas’s responsibility for contributing to that suffering is to miss the whole picture. Hamas rules Gaza, and it has chosen to buy missiles and weapons with funds that were meant to build a better society for Gazan civilians.

Last weekend’s attack was designed by Hamas to prompt a heavy response by Israel and stir up the pot, probably to kill a Saudi-Israeli peace deal, even if it meant sacrificing Palestinian civilians in the process.

These are the people who reflexively see “microaggressions” everywhere, yet are blind to this macroaggression. The people who insist that “words are violence,” yet celebrated actual violence against innocents as a form of “resistance.” The people who are quick to accuse so many institutions of systemic racism, yet glorify an institution (Hamas) that has been publicly and unapologetically antisemitic for decades.

He also pledged America’s support for Israel, promising to send ammunition and other assistance.

With anger in his voice, Biden said that babies were among those who had been killed by Hamas, and that women had been “assaulted and paraded as trophies.” He compared Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, with the Islamic State, and said that it did not stand for the rights of Palestinians. He announced that 14 U.S. citizens had been among the more than 1,000 people killed by Hamas, with others being held hostage.

My colleague Peter Baker, who has been covering the White House since the 1990s, said it was “one of the sharpest, even angriest condemnations of terrorism in Israel that I’ve ever heard from an American president.” He added, “Biden offered no equivocation and made no effort to urge restraints on Israel’s response.”

Israeli airstrikes reduced buildings to rubble in Gaza, the impoverished coastal enclave ruled by Hamas. The strikes continued even after the group, which is believed to have taken around 150 Israeli hostages, threatened to kill a captive each time Israel strikes Gaza without warning. At least 900 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza."

Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, extended the invitation to Biden over the weekend, but the White House has not said whether the president would accept it. The invitation arrived as Israelis continued to learn more about the Hamas attacks. The military now believes the group took 199 people hostage, nearly 50 more than previously thought.

A trip by Biden amid the conflict would be a remarkable gamble, and pose enormous challenges in terms of both security and politics. His presence would signal to rivals like Iran, Syria and Hezbollah that Israel has U.S. backing at a time of widespread anxiety about a regional war. But it could also tie Biden and the U.S. to the increasing bloodshed in Gaza.

Israel’s continued airstrikes, which they say have killed at least six Hamas senior leaders so far, have forced hundreds of thousands of Gazans from their homes and deepened the humanitarian crisis there.

1. In “The Attack on Israel Demands Unity and Resolve,” the New York Times editorial board writes:

President Biden is right to express America’s full support for Israel at this painful moment. The United States, as its closest ally, has a critical role to play. Moderate Israeli opposition leaders said they were prepared to join Mr. Netanyahu in an emergency government. The Biden administration, and all of Israel’s friends and allies, should encourage such a broad coalition. A unity government is the best chance Israel has to come together to defend itself against aggression, as it has at so many times in its history, and emerge from this war able to keep working toward a stable, secure future that includes peace with the Palestinians. It is also the administration’s duty to work to prevent this terrible eruption of violence from spreading from Gaza to involve Palestinians in the West Bank. Mr. Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and others have an invaluable role to play in maintaining open communication with leaders of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and of neighboring Arab states to urge calm.

2. In “Seeking a Moral Compass in Gaza’s War,” the columnist Nicholas Kristof writes:

The terror attacks by Hamas against civilians who were in their homes and dancing at a concert are being called Israel’s Sept. 11, and that’s a fair comparison. Let’s hope that Israel responds to this outrage more wisely than we in the United States did to the attack on our country. There’s a lot of loose talk about eliminating Hamas, and Hamas deserves it. As a journalist who has traveled repeatedly to Gaza, I’m appalled by the sympathy that some Americans and Europeans have shown for a misogynist and repressive terror organization like Hamas. If you care about human rights, you want to see Hamas eliminated. Yet dismantling terrorist organizations can be harder than it looks and can raise troubling moral questions about collateral damage. The Taliban also deserved elimination, yet in the end it was the United States that was eliminated from Afghanistan. I worry that Israel may charge into Gaza with a ground invasion as thoughtlessly as we plowed into Iraq.

He continues:

If we owe a moral responsibility to Israeli children, then we owe the same moral responsibility to Palestinian children. Their lives have equal weight. If you care about human life only in Israel or only in Gaza, then you don’t actually care about human life. What that means in practice is difficult to navigate. Israel has a right to respond, and in war, civilians inevitably suffer.

3. In the guest essay “What More Must the Children of Gaza Suffer?” Fadi Abu Shammalah, the executive director of the General Union of Cultural Centers in Gaza, writes:

I am trying to imagine some positive outcome that this terrifying escalation might bring. Perhaps there will be an exchange of prisoners. Though Palestinians have the right to resist occupation, I have always preferred unarmed, civilian-led, direct mass action. Maybe the Palestinian, Israeli and international activists who have been using these tactics to oppose Israel’s occupation and a system that major human rights organizations — including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Israeli rights group B’Tselem — consider apartheid will be able to harness this horror to someday advance their vision of a future of liberation and a decent life for all. But at the moment, with Israeli troops massing on the border with Gaza, suggesting an imminent ground invasion, I can’t think beyond the coming days. How many more families will be obliterated? How many children will be made orphans and homeless? What will happen when the shelves in our markets are empty and reserves of fuel for our hospitals’ generators run out? What will become of our collective humanity if Israeli civilians continue to be targeted and bombs keep shattering our infrastructure, leaving Gazan children lying dead in our streets? Unless the international community intervenes, Israel can continue to cut off access to water, food, fuel, electricity, medications and every other necessity of life. Without outside pressure, particularly from the United States, Israel can continue to flatten our cities and refugee camps.

4. And in “The Pathways to Peace Are Getting Darker,” Dahlia Scheindlin, a political strategist and public opinion expert who lives in Tel Aviv, writes:

Hamas’s savage attack was a shock — but not a surprise. We have all watched peacemaking fail here, as it often does. This isn’t just a crisis for grass-roots peace activists, it’s a grand failure on a global stage. Lately the whole notion of solving conflicts, containing violence through international rules and institutions, the international system itself, appears wholly inadequate to the task of protecting people and preventing wars.

She continues:

But I can’t leave it there. I’ve seen the other side, too — solidarity that cuts across bitter political divides. My Palestinian and Israeli friends and colleagues comfort one another in times of escalation; we bond over our commitment to ending systems of oppression and injustice, and deplore violence against civilians. Hundreds of Jewish and Palestinian activists in Israel met on Zoom in the midst of the horror last Saturday to organize against the awful specter of violence in Israel’s mixed Jewish-Arab towns. As the old peace paradigms collapse, those of us working on new approaches toward partnership-based peace (including a group called “A Land for All,” where I am a board member), rather than the hard partition that stokes us-or-them competition, generate new energy. Political peace may be light-years away, but these rare sparks of optimism are the fuel that will carry us there.

Cellular and internet service were cut off for much of the territory, and Palestinians said fear and panic were spreading.

The escalation came after two consecutive nights of raids into Gaza by Israeli forces, which officials described as laying the groundwork for the next phase of the war.

“It’s really unclear what’s going on. Clearly, something unusual is happening,” Patrick Kingsley, the Times Jerusalem bureau chief, said on The Headlines: War Briefing podcast.

“It could be that an invasion is already underway and the military is keeping mum about it,” he added. “Or this could be a pressure tactic, an attempt to make Hamas and other militias inside Gaza feel that they are about to be overrun by the Israeli military.”"
658,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/briefing/israeli-forces-move-deeper-into-gaza.html,"The Israeli military advanced on Gaza City from at least three sides today as it battered the enclave with airstrikes. The deepest reach, about three miles, paralleled the Mediterranean coast toward the Shati refugee camp on the northern flank of the city. Here’s a map showing locations of Israeli troops in Gaza.

Formations of troops and armored vehicles approached the city and neighboring population centers from the north, east and south, as shown by eyewitness photos and videos verified by The New York Times, as well as satellite imagery.

At a news conference, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forcefully rejected calls for a cease-fire as “calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism.”

It took hours for outside observers to understand that Israel was beginning a ground invasion on Friday, and it has been more incremental than anticipated. Under U.S. pressure to temper Israel’s response to the Hamas killing of more than 1,400 people, Israel has avoided describing the operation as an invasion."
659,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/12/briefing/israel-hamas-war-consumer-prices.html,"Israel moved troops into position for a multipronged invasion of the Gaza Strip in an effort to dismantle Hamas, the militant group who massacred more than 1,200 Israelis in an attack over the weekend.

No decision has been made yet about when or even whether to launch a ground war, officials insisted, but Israel has called up 360,000 reservists, sending many near the Gaza border.

That a major operation is coming is hardly in doubt, but there are tactical arguments over how one should start. And hanging over everything is the question of how long Israeli forces would stay. There is little appetite to reoccupy the Gaza Strip, Itamar Yaar, a former deputy head of Israel’s National Security Council, told The New York Times.

Six days of Israeli airstrikes targeting Hamas have devastated parts of Gaza. The U.N. issued an official warning of “disaster” as hospitals ran short on fuel for generators and corridors were crammed with wounded people. More than 300,000 Palestinians in Gaza have lost their homes, and the Health Ministry said that 1,417 had been killed. The only power plant in the territory shut down yesterday."
660,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/11/briefing/israel-unity-government-gop-steve-scalise.html,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel formed an emergency government today, adding two opposition lawmakers — both former army chiefs — to his cabinet. The infusion of military expertise, analysts say, will give the government greater legitimacy to make major wartime decisions, including when and whether to send troops into Gaza.

The arrangement was made as Israeli warplanes struck Hamas targets in Gaza for a fifth day and more evidence emerged of the trail of terror inflicted by the Hamas incursion over the weekend: Bodies were in the streets, people were shot dead at a bus stop and bullet holes were found in residential walls.

Israel has said little about what appears to be a spectacular failure of its security and intelligence operations. A detailed analysis by my colleagues found that the slow response by Israeli forces gave Hamas terrorists many hours to infiltrate more than 20 towns. Israel said the death toll had reached 1,200, with about 150 people believed to be held hostage in Gaza.

Fears of a humanitarian disaster were also growing in Gaza, where officials say at least 1,100 Palestinians have been killed. The Israeli military has assembled tanks and soldiers along the Gaza border, and Egypt’s president said that he would not allow Palestinians to seek refuge in his country, closing off the only evacuation route for civilians in Gaza."
661,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/world/middleeast/gaza-al-shifa-hospital-israel.html,"To people in Gaza, Al Shifa is the biggest and most advanced hospital around — a lifeline, in normal times, and now a place of refuge from relentless Israeli airstrikes.

More than 60,000 people are sheltering there. But to the Israeli military, it is a threat, and, perhaps, a target.

On Friday, hours before the Israeli military stepped up its bombardment of Gaza in retaliation for Hamas’s mass killings of Israelis three weeks ago, it held a news conference in which it said that Al Shifa conceals underground command centers for Hamas — raising fears that the military was laying the groundwork for attacking the hospital.

Hamas “does its command and control in different departments of the hospital,” said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, speaking in English and citing intelligence sources that he did not release. He displayed an illustrated map of the hospital marking what he said were several underground Hamas installations in the complex."
662,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/learning/the-israel-gaza-war-a-forum-for-young-people-to-react.html,"On Monday, Israel ordered a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip as it retaliated for the attack, the largest and deadliest incursion into its territory in decades. Israeli jets launched airstrikes on Gaza, which Israel’s military said had destroyed centers that house Hamas militants. Palestinian officials said that a hospital had been hit, along with multistory buildings, homes, mosques and a busy marketplace, and that more than 700 Palestinians had been killed. Hamas threatened to respond to the Israeli bombing campaign by executing hostages.

The relentless, deadly conflict between Israel and Palestinians has spanned two centuries. The fighting has left thousands dead. Sometimes, the bloodshed has been incited by Israel targeting militant leaders or responding to protests. Other times, violence has been set off by attacks from Hamas or other militants. In this case, there was no obvious flashpoint, and Israel’s intelligence community and government seem to have been caught by surprise.

Gaza has been under a suffocating Israeli blockade, backed by Egypt, since Hamas seized control of the coastal strip in 2007. The blockade restricts the import of goods, including electronic and computer equipment, that could be used to make weapons and prevents most people from leaving the territory.

The timing of the assault was notable, hitting Israel at one of the most difficult moments in its history. It came after months of profound anxiety about the cohesion of Israeli society and the readiness of its military, a crisis prompted by the far-right government’s efforts to reduce the power of the judiciary.

The attacks also came on the holiday of Simchat Torah, and nearly 50 years to the day since the Israeli authorities were caught off-guard when invading forces from Egypt and Syria set off the start of the Yom Kippur War."

“Based on what I’ve seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you,” he said, appearing with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv.

A spokeswoman for the U.S. National Security Council said that “our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information, is that Israel is not responsible.”

Palestinian officials blamed an Israeli airstrike. The Israel Defense Forces said the explosion was caused by an errant rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group allied with Hamas.

And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel took the unusual step of delivering a televised address on the Jewish Sabbath to say that the campaign against Hamas, which over the weekend carried out the worst terrorist attack in the country in 50 years, is just beginning.

The Health Ministry in Gaza said that airstrikes had killed at least 70 Palestinians who had been trying to flee the northern part of the territory, and the U.N. warned that Israel’s evacuation order would lead to “devastating consequences.” The organization said that its priority was negotiating with Israel to allow the opening of a humanitarian channel for deliveries of essential aid, including water.

The U.S. is also trying to broker safe passage out of Gaza and into Egypt for American citizens and other foreigners.

The Gaza Health Ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, said the strikes killed or wounded “hundreds” of people. A doctor at a nearby hospital said the facility was receiving hundreds of injured and that dozens were dead.

The Israeli military said its strike had killed Hamas militants, including Ibrahim Biari, a commander who it said had helped plan the massacres in Israel on Oct. 7. It also said that the “underground terror infrastructure” beneath the buildings in Jabaliya had collapsed following the strike.

There was a palpable sense of crisis in Gaza on Friday, as a buildup of Israeli soldiers near Gaza fueled concerns that Israel was preparing to invade the Hamas-held territory. Many Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza were reluctant to leave their homes for the south, which has even fewer resources, across routes that have already been damaged by a week of Israeli strikes. The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said on Friday that airstrikes had killed at least 70 Palestinians and wounded 200 others who were attempting to flee northern Gaza by car on a main highway. And an ongoing siege pushed Gaza’s medical system to the brink of collapse.

Aid groups warned of a looming humanitarian catastrophe and said that the Israeli order to evacuate was illegal under international law. The United Nations also warned that moving more than a million people across Gaza would lead to “devastating consequences,” saying that its priority was negotiating with Israel to allow the opening of a humanitarian channel for deliveries of essential aid, including water.

“It is clear to us that the clock is ticking,” said Stéphane Dujarric, a U.N. spokesman.

Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes since Saturday, when Hamas’s incursion into Israel killed more than 1,300 people, have wiped out entire neighborhoods. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said on Friday that at least 1,900 Palestinians had been killed in Gaza, and more than 7,600 injured since the war began."
673,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/world/middleeast/heres-the-latest-on-the-war.html,"President Biden headed home on Wednesday after a wartime trip to Israel, where he forcefully vowed that the United States would stand fast with Israel in its war against Hamas and unveiled a newly brokered deal to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza from Egypt.

As outrage rippled through the Arab world over a blast that killed hundreds at a hospital in Gaza, President Biden firmly backed the Israeli government’s assertion that it had nothing to do with the hospital explosion. American and Israeli intelligence officials say early evidence showed the deadly explosion was caused by an errant rocket fired by Palestinian fighters.

In a speech, Mr. Biden talked emotionally about the “all-consuming rage” Israelis must feel after seeing 1,400 people slaughtered by Hamas terrorists in cross-border raids on Oct. 7. But then he cautioned Israelis not to be so consumed by rage that they make mistakes. “After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States,” he said. “While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.”

It was not clear Mr. Biden’s speech in Tel Aviv would dampen widespread anger over the war and the carnage on Tuesday at Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, which have prompted widespread anti-Israel protests from Tehran to Rabat, Morocco. Many civilians had taken shelter from Israel’s bombing campaign on the hospital grounds."

Later, that all changed when the Israel Defense Forces said the explosion was caused by a rocket fired by a Palestinian armed group that failed after launching. But by early Wednesday, neither assertion could be immediately verified.

The explosion left a grisly aftermath, according to videos verified by The New York Times and photographs distributed by news agencies. Bloodied and charred bodies were strewn across the courtyard of the hospital. Blankets, backpacks and mattresses lay nearby, traces of families who had come to seek refuge at the hospital after their homes were destroyed.

Fearful residents flooded U.N.-run schools seeking shelter from explosions as Israeli troops moved toward the border for a possible ground invasion to dismantle Hamas.

Six days of Israeli bombardment, following brutal surprise attacks by Hamas that killed more than 1,200 people in Israel, have forced more than 300,000 Palestinians from their homes, with no immediate sign that emergency relief would be allowed in. Satellite imagery of residential areas shows dozens of flattened buildings, and video has shown the devastation wrought by an airstrike on a refugee camp.

Officials in Israel, the United States and other nations continued to seek ways to free about 150 hostages believed to have been taken by Hamas, while the White House announced that charter flights would be sent to evacuate Americans trying to escape the conflict. Several European airlines and governments have also organized evacuation flights, and Britain said it would send a Royal Navy task group to help with humanitarian relief efforts — as well as surveillance aircraft to track security threats to Israel.

Israel continued to pummel the 140-square-mile Gaza Strip on Thursday with airstrikes of a magnitude and intensity not seen in its past assaults. The Gazan Health Ministry said that 1,537 Palestinians had been killed and 6,612 others injured since Saturday."

From New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.” [MUSIC PLAYING] I don’t really know how to start this. Grief moves slowly, and war moves quickly. One person said after last week’s audio essay, that, “To so quickly focus on the Israeli army’s response lacked a certain humanism.” And I understood and felt what they meant. I also want to stay in the grief I have for the Israelis killed and the fear I have for the hostages being held. And I think there would have been wisdom, emotional and geopolitical, if Israel had given itself time to grieve and time to plan before fully committing to a response. But that’s not what happened. Israel dropped more than 6,000 bombs on Gaza in just the first week. It tightened a noose around the territory, keeping out food and water and medicine and fuel. A report I saw a few days ago said that Gaza is down to one week of insulin. One week of insulin — less now. My wife is a type I diabetic, dependent on insulin to stay alive. A detail like that carries force for me. What if it was my wife, the person I love most who couldn’t get insulin? More than 5,000 Palestinians have been reported dead, many more injured. There’s a part of me that would like to stay in my feelings from right after Hamas’s attack, but that is not where this has held. And the decisions being made now, and that will be made soon, will decide a lot of lives. My approach to this topic is going to be to try to keep the boundaries of what can be said and considered open, to try to add context and to try to hear out a lot of different perspectives. I said this last week — I’m not somebody who believes that I know how to solve this conflict. I’m not somebody who believes this conflict can currently be solved. I think we’re at a much more primitive point in it right now. But the building toward somewhere better, I think, requires a lot of different experiences to be heard. So I have plans for shows right now with people who are much further right than me on this. I have plans that will center on Palestinian experiences and voices. But I wanted to begin with a show closer to where I am, which is not a popular or easy place to be at the moment, which is the Jewish left. Many of us on the Jewish left on this felt abandoned and morally appalled at the comments of people who had once been our allies immediately after. What the left came to mean, quickly, in this conflict, the people who defined it, were people who seemed to give no consideration to the lives of Israelis. We do. In many cases, the point of our involvement here is that we are attached in a deep way to Israel. Meanwhile, the force and ferocity of the Israeli response built. And if you believe, as many of us believe, that there is no answer to this for Israel, for anybody until Israel can live in security while Palestinians do not live inside a regime of oppression, and humiliation, and immiseration, and terror, then amidst the grief is a fear that this is only getting worse. Palestinians mourn their dead and hate their killers just as much and fiercely as Israelis do. And the two sides somehow must live next to each other. So what is the plan here? There are ideas that float around, and they’ve become, I think, scarier in recent years. In 2017, Bezalel Smotrich wrote that, quote, “Any solution must be based on cutting off the ambition to realize the Arab national hope between the Jordan and the Mediterranean. The statement the Arab yearning for national expression in the land of Israel cannot be repressed is incorrect.” He now serves in Netanyahu’s cabinet as minister of finance. This is the kind of thinking that has been in power in recent years — the thinking that says the repression has not been full enough. It has brought us here. But that does not mean it will weaken now. It may well strengthen. There are those who think a permanent occupation or an act of mass expulsion are the only true answers in this conflict. So I want to have a conversation with some other people coming from a similar perspective but with a lot more expertise on the core issues here than I have. Spencer Ackerman is a national security reporter, Pulitzer Prize winner, author of the newsletter “Forever Wars,” author of the great book on post-9/11 politics, “Reign of Terror.” Peter Beinart writes for New York Times Opinion. He’s a professor of journalism and political science at City University of New York. He’s the editor at large of Jewish Currents, and author of the Substack “The Beinart Notebook.” And they’ve both been writing pieces that I think are of deep relevance right now. Spencer has been particularly following up on the symmetries to post-9/11 politics in America and the way military planning happens in that kind of moment. Beinart wrote a great piece thinking about the question, before you can ever get to any kind of settlement, you need groups in power on both sides that would want to see a settlement. So if you want nonviolence to take hold, if you want other tactics to work, how are they rewarded? What are the feedback loops that can be created to give more power to those who want to see something very different? As always, my email ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com.

Thanks for having me.

ezra klein

So Spencer, I want to begin here. What is your sense now of what Hamas was trying to achieve in this attack?

spencer ackerman

So there have been some interesting reports that have come out this week that I think clarify that question, but not in a satisfying way. There was a report out of The Washington Post, where a Hamas senior official, sort of on the face of it meaning to heighten a message of Israeli vulnerability, nevertheless said that they didn’t reckon that Israel would respond the way that Israel has. That they thought they would take some hostages and negotiate them for the thousands of Palestinians who are in Israeli military prisons, and the status quo ante would prevail. I think if it turns out that indeed Hamas was trying for a more limited sense of concrete achievement for liberating prisoners, that has turned out to be just catastrophically wrong.

ezra klein

I’ve seen some reporting, similarly, from Hamas on this, and I’ve found it truly bizarre. I mean, this was in planning, in scale, a kind of attack Hamas had never launched before. It’s a land, sea, and air attack. It involves mass killing of Israeli civilians, some things they probably didn’t know they would stumble into, like the rave which led to quite a bit of their body count. So maybe their soldiers, or whatever you want to call them, took a kind of gruesome initiative in that. But they also spread videos of them killing Israelis on social media. They’ve been on people’s Facebook pages almost gloating about their death. There were a lot of hostages taken. There are a lot of ways people characterize Hamas, but it would take a kind of genuine madness and true irrationality to me for them to plan an attack of that scale and not believe it would create an overwhelming Israeli response. Now, there’s been a lot of commentary saying, well, they must have known they would get this kind of response, and so they wanted it. They wanted to provoke Israel into this kind of attack. They wanted to disrupt the accords with Saudi Arabia, something like that. And those two narratives now seem in real tension. So I’m curious how you think about that piece of it?

spencer ackerman

So one thing that struck me from the first wave of Hamas statements during the weekend of the 7th, after Simchat Torah, was that they didn’t mention the Saudi deal. I was writing a piece for The Nation precisely about this when it happened and was looking very closely to see the degree to which, if at all, Hamas would mention it. And they didn’t. They were talking about more material facts closer to home rather than diplomatic facts on the horizon from 30,000 feet above — the freeing of the prisoners, the loosening of the Israeli strangulation of Gaza on down the line. And again, I think there are ways after the fact — I’ve seen this a lot in the American national security community over the last 12 days — that we often try and reason backward from the actions that a given combatant like Hamas took and presume a greater strategy there, presume that they must have known X, Y and Z would happen. That often is not the way combatants in war operate, from a planning stage to an execution stage, from a strategic to an operational to a tactical level. Should that be borne out by further reporting probably speaks to the way that miscalculation is an underappreciated factor in every wartime combatant. This is something I’ve seen up close and personally. The ambitions we have, the opportunities we see, the desires that we have when we give into violence on an institutional level blind us not just in the banal way to the humanity of the people that come into our crosshairs, but to our own recognition of what reality is and what’s achievable here. I hesitate to speculate or to put myself into a position of trying to read the minds of Hamas. All I can read are their statements and their actions, and through them, remember all of the times that I have seen optimistic, to the point of irrationality, statements from American, Israeli, all sorts of other combatants describing the glorious ways their war will go and why it will lead to the achievement of all of these grander objections that then go down in flames.

peter beinart

I would just add that although I don’t know what Hamas expected, I do think it’s important to remember that Hamas does have a multi-decade long history of intentionally targeting and killing civilians. They did it during the Second Intifada in the early 2000s. They did it during the 1990s, during the Oslo process. So I don’t think anyone should have been surprised that Hamas members would kill civilians. Maybe they hadn’t had the opportunity to kill this many, but this is something that Hamas has repeatedly shown that it’s willing to do.

ezra klein

And let me then build on that, because, as you say, this has been the most horrific of Hamas’s attacks. They have tried many things. Nothing has, from a perspective of pure murder, worked as well as this. What is your sense of how the attack has changed — let me put it this way — both the politics and the mass psychology in Israel?

peter beinart

I think that the agony that Israelis are going through is unfathomable, greater than what Americans experienced after Sept. 11. Greater just because as a share of the population it was much higher. Greater because of the deeper level of trauma that Israeli Jews and other Jews carry. And greater because Al Qaeda was far away from us. I mean, they came to New York and they were mostly in other parts of the world. Gaza and Hamas are on Israel’s borders. So that’s, I think, the profound reality. And I think there is, coexisting with that, a deep rage and anger at the Netanyahu government that eventually will probably produce some kind of political earthquake. But what kind of political earthquake, we don’t know. And I think an absolute resolute belief among Jewish Israelis — it’s important to remember that 20 percent of Israel’s citizens are Palestinians — but among Jewish Israelis, I think, overwhelming consensus that Hamas must be destroyed. Now, when you actually try to ask what that means, things become a lot more cloudy, and I don’t think people have good answers. But that gut-level emotional reaction seems nearly consensus.

ezra klein

I want to put a pin in that question of what it means to destroy Hamas. But I want to get at something else on the psychology. One of the things that has been very present for me in some of the more upsetting commentary right after Hamas’s attacks, partly the commentary that couldn’t imagine there being any such thing as an Israeli civilian, one thing I noticed in that is a kind of rigid categorization of power in a matchup between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza. Israel is by far the more powerful party. And you can see that right now. But you can’t understand Israeli psychology at all — you can’t understand, I think, Jewish psychology at all without understanding the fear of genuine eradication at the center of it. How many times Jews have been powerless. How many times Israel has faced, in living memory and the memory of people who are in power there now, attacks that if they had gone another way would have wiped Israel off the map. And so I wanted to get you to talk a bit about the way those two — both realities and psychologies — interplay, the Israeli strength and Israeli — the genuine felt sense it is a small place surrounded by people who would try to wipe it out if they could.

peter beinart

There’s no question that those things are buried very deep for many, many Jews and then, for Israelis, exacerbated by the traumas that have taken place in Israel. This happened almost 50 years to the day of the Yom Kippur War, which was an extremely traumatic experience. Many, many Israelis have people who have been lost. And I totally agree with you, one of the things that really disturbed me about some of the commentary on the left was that there was a language of things like decolonization that erased the humanity of Israeli Jews. And it reminded me of — this is something George Orwell wrote a lot about — the way in which certain kind of rhetorical formulations that people become very invested in then become a way of covering over the human realities of what’s actually being done in their name. And I felt that way about some of the language of decolonization. Well, this is just what decolonization looks like. If you have to break some eggs to make an omelet, so be it. That is to me a kind of monstrous kind of thinking, very frightening. I also think that this is fear that Israeli Jews have that has been fanned by a government that has dehumanized Palestinians and made it harder for Israeli Jews to see Palestinians as ordinary people who have ordinary human desires, who mostly just want to live and be able to raise their kids in the same kinds of ways that we all want to do. And I think because there has been so much dehumanization of Palestinians in Israel, it has made it even more difficult to see Palestinians in any other way than through as, essentially, the next group of people who threaten Jewish existence.

ezra klein

I want to ask you then about another side of this, which is how the attacks have changed psychology for Jews living outside Israel, and particularly those who have a very complicated or critical relationship with Israel, which I think describes everybody at the table here. There’s the period running up to this where the right-wing turn in Israeli politics I think began to sever a lot of ties people had. I mean, my relationship to Israel had changed quite a bit as the left began to collapse there, as the peace process died, as Netanyahu and very, very, very far-right extremist cabinet ministers took and held power. And then there was also the attacks and the moment after them, and then there was — I saw online and in a lot of people I knew a real rupture between those same Jews, many of whom who’ve worked for peace for a long time, and what they were seeing among people they often thought of as their allies. And I’ve been watching a community I’m part of try to manage these two now very complicated relationships. And I’m curious how you’ve experienced that, how you’ve seen it.

peter beinart

I genuinely believe that at the heart of Judaism is the metaphor of family. This is what makes it different than Christianity and Islam. Genesis is the story mostly of a family. And in Exodus, it becomes a nation. And it’s imagined as a kind of extended family — B’nai Israel, the children of Israel. Israel being the name that Isaac — that Jacob is given, sorry, after he wrestles with the angel. So I believe that very, very deeply. And so, for me, this has awoken that in some really, really, really powerful ways. And I struggle, and it’s. Very, very difficult to hold the sense of particular obligation, particular special connection that I feel to Israeli Jews, like Jews all over the world, with the fact that I know that so many people in my community are weaponizing that and using that in a way to lobotomize us so that we don’t care about what happens to Palestinians and so we are OK with whatever is done to them because we care only about our own families. And that logic can become horrifying in the days to come. So I have never felt as much of a sense of struggle with my own community and with my own love of a sense of community, and trying to hold that and also be desperately afraid of the way in which it’s leading some people to act.

ezra klein

Let’s talk then, Spencer, about what is actually being done. How would you describe what Israel is doing in response, both what the tactics are — what they have announced and shown themselves to be doing since Hamas’s attack —and then what the broader strategy is? What have they articulated, or what do they appear to be trying to achieve?

spencer ackerman

Tactically what Israel is producing is collective punishment against 2.3 million Gazans intensifying its strangulation of some of the most densely packed places on Earth, calling it as it will. I started seeing reports that Gaza is without painkillers, that doctors are operating on wounded people — of whom there are I believe more than 10,000 as of this recording — without anesthesia. This is Israel’s tactics against Gaza. Not against Hamas — against Gaza.

ezra klein

people.

spencer ackerman

Yes. And let’s just skip to the day after what Netanyahu describes as a long war. Israel can deal severe blows to human beings and has an unquestioned capability to perhaps kill members of Hamas and perhaps decapitate Hamas’s leadership structure as well. But there will be something that comes after whatever Israel’s operation is. And as long as Israel keeps the conditions of strangulation on Gaza, there will be something that comes after Hamas, whatever its form ends up taking. And when we see Israel flattening buildings, taking these kinds of collective punishment measures, then it looks to me less like a war against Hamas and more like a calling of Palestinians in Gaza with Hamas as a proximate target.

ezra klein

One thing I have heard many people say now, and that includes many Palestinians, but it also now includes some Israelis who have called for this openly, like a member of the Knesset, is that what Israel really wants to do here is what gets called a second Nakba, a second mass expulsion of Palestinians, creation of hundreds of thousands of refugees who don’t or cannot come back. And one reason people believe that is that there are those in the Israeli government who seem to want that before this. And so the fear is that Hamas’s atrocities become the excuse for something that the far right in Israel could not have achieved before, but now it has a political and military space to try to achieve. So can you first say what a Nakba is, what that word means in this context, and then whether you think that’s a reasonable fear?

peter beinart

Yeah, so Nakba is the Arabic word for catastrophe. And it describes the experience in which more than half of the Palestinian population was expelled or fled in fear during Israel’s war of independence, between, essentially, 1947 and 1949. But the point that Palestinians make again and again is that in a certain sense the Nakba never ended because there have been expulsions that have continued — drips and drabs. There was another large one in 1967. In some ways, it wouldn’t even be the second Nakba. You could actually say it would be the third Nakba. And smaller scale every year in between in various ways. Most of the people in Gaza — and I don’t think this is sufficiently recognized in the mainstream American press sometimes — are not from Gaza. They are the children and grandchildren and some are original refugees who were forced from what is now Israel. And there is this profound collective trauma about the fact that this is happening again. We know from what we’ve seen in the United States in recent years, the way that things in the deep history of a country, if they’re never dealt with, if they’re never acknowledged, if there’s never a process of reparation and historical justice, they remain there waiting for a moment of trauma to come back. So when Israel said, leave the Northern Gaza Strip and go to the Southern Gaza Strip, many Palestinians, especially elderly Palestinians, were saying, I will not leave, because this is happening again. We know we will not be allowed to return. This is a very, very real threat that exists at this moment. And the American government needs to have, as one of its central policy goals, to ensure that Joe Biden is not judged by history as an American president who allowed yet another Nakba to take place on his watch.

spencer ackerman

I would add to that that before this past weekend, a tremendous amount of effort from the Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and the Biden administration was to create this, what they would call humanitarian corridor that they suggested would be a way of getting Palestinians out of Gaza into Sinai from the onslaught that Israel plans to put on Gaza. And they had to hear not just from Palestinians, who I’m not sure that they really properly interacted with, but from the regional governments, that that was — and this was Blinken’s term — a non starter, because everyone in the region, Palestinian and non Palestinan, recognized the historical reference point of the Nakba. I talked on Sunday, right after this began happening, with a formerly Palestinian-American who now lives in Turkey, named Sami Al-Arian, someone whom the war on terror railroaded out of this country. And I asked him about the intensification that Gaza was about to experience. We were talking in the context of a piece I was doing for The Nation about the Americans’ efforts to put together a Saudi normalization with Israel in the context of the war. And he said, what else can they do? And I said, well, for instance, they could push you out of Gaza. And he said, that’s a fantasy. That’s a fantasy of the right. We’re not leaving. And I can’t stop thinking of these words that he said afterwards, which is that if we have to die, we’ll die in our homes. That now a government that purports to speak for the safety and national aspirations of Jews worldwide is inflicting upon another people. I cannot think of a less Jewish thing than to make another person a refugee. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

So recognizing, Peter, this is a very hard question to put to anybody, but something that I think people will think hearing this is, look, it’s easy sitting in New York to criticize. But as you said very eloquently earlier, one way this is different than 9/11 is that Israel and Gaza abud each other. The West Bank — that everybody is crammed in together. So what would a moral response be, and not just a moral response, but one that took seriously the Israeli people’s need for security? And also, and I think this is not just a fair, but an important question of statecraft, that it can’t be costless to slaughter Israeli civilians and take Israeli hostages. I mean, no country on Earth would allow that.

peter beinart

So first of all, there has to be an effort to bring back these captives. And although this has very, very little purchase, probably, in Israel, I think if your number one overriding goal is the safety of those people, Israel would need to consider some kind of prisoner swap with Hamas, perhaps for elderly Palestinian prisoners who represent no actual threat once they leave prison. I agree that the people who masterminded this attack, the people who carried those attacks, those people are war criminals. They should be dealt with. They should be brought to justice. Beyond that, my fear is that Israel is going to go into Gaza on the ground looking for security and safety, and what it’s ultimately going to get is less safety and less security than it has today.

ezra klein

Doesn’t a mass prisoner swap for the hostages create the incentive for Hamas to do this again and again? I mean, as Spencer said earlier, consensus view is one thing Hamas wanted out of this was a bunch of Israeli civilian hostages because they have done prisoner swaps in the past. And they saw that as a way to do another one here. To give them what they wanted on that, doesn’t that just create a reason for them to keep doing it, to make this a successful strategy for them?

peter beinart

Absolutely, that is a very real danger of that strategy. But I also fear that what Israel is doing now is going to lead ultimately to Hamas being stronger. And I don’t think that’s because all those Palestinians who are supporting Hamas believe in the killing of civilians. Some do tragically, but many don’t. It’s because they have seen no other form of resistance that has gotten them anywhere. Israel has been blockading Gaza for 17 years. When the blockade began, Hamas’s rockets were these very, very primitive things. 17 years later, their arsenal is much more formidable than it was. And they were able to do this. This is not a good trajectory to be on for the safety of Israelis. Fundamentally, Palestinians are going to resist their oppression because all human beings resist their oppression.

ezra klein

There’s an interesting piece by Amjad Iraqi in the London Review of Books. And he writes, quote, “Young Palestinians — many of whom were raised under the false promises of the Oslo Accords signed 30 years ago last month — have been taking up arms and joining local militias unaffiliated with the major political parties. On the streets and online, Palestinian activists no longer care to tiptoe around diplomatic language or references to international laws that have failed them.” And I feel like it’s something we’ve seen before, that even if you imagine a world where Israel’s quite successful in smashing Hamas, that doesn’t necessarily mean the world you get is no extremist violent groups dedicated to killing Israelis. That what you might get is a splintering into somewhat yet more extreme and dangerous groups that have no political arm whatsoever, which Hamas is this weird kind of — it has a political arm. It has a military arm. You’ve watched this kind of thing happen before. So I’m curious what you make of it? It reminds me a little bit of the pre-ISIS conversation and the post-ISIS conversation. And ISIS has been back here as a metaphor a lot. But as you mentioned in the piece, not being used as a way you might think that metaphor would be used.

spencer ackerman

When the United States invaded Iraq, there was barely any Al Qaeda presence there. That quickly changed, and it became home to the most violent, nihilistic and ambitious affiliate of Al Qaeda. And then when the United States, in 2006, ‘07, ‘08, believed that it had dealt a fatal blow to that organization, that, along with the Syrian Civil War next door, combined to create an enemy far greater, far more loathsome and terrifying than the one that the United States went into Iraq to stop. We have seen this again and again and again in conditions of occupation, apartheid, strangulation, whereby, as these conditions persist, they don’t empower the levelest heads among us. They create despair, and despair will have a reaction. Despair will emerge in ways that we who do not experience that despair will find barbaric, probably correctly so in many cases, and more importantly, won’t anticipate. Only when you deal at the root with addressing the fundamental conditions of that despair can this dynamic change at all. And to expect this to be an exception is to be blind to a history that we have seen unfold not just in our lifetimes, but across 75 years of Israeli history and American sponsorship.

peter beinart

People act as if this conflict began with Hamas. Palestinians were fighting against Israel and Zionism, including by killing civilians. For instance, in the hijackings of the 1970s, the 1972 Munich Olympics. And that was not Hamas. Hamas didn’t exist. That wasn’t Islamists. Those were largely — a lot of them were leftist Palestinian organizations. So anyone who thinks you are going to end Palestinian attacks on civilians even if you could get rid of Hamas, unless you deal with the root of the violence of oppression, it seems to me is kidding themselves.

ezra klein

Something you often hear said is why isn’t there a nonviolent Palestinian movement? Why can’t this be more like the anti-Apartheid movement in South Africa? Why can’t it be more like the Gandhian independence movement in India? And you wrote a great piece for The Times kind of thinking through, particularly, the South African comparison. So how do you contrast that? And what is your answer to why the path of violence has been chosen and the path of nonviolence seems so now dormant?

peter beinart

Well, the African National Congress was not nonviolent. In the early 1960s, they actually adopted armed struggle. And yet, they worked pretty hard to not go after civilians. They felt like that was a moral red line, rightly. And the argument that I made in my piece — of course, there are many, many differences between these two situations — is to understand how the A.N.C. was able to maintain that moral code in which, at one point, they took responsibility and virtually apologized after some of their cadres, their commandos had killed civilians, was that their moral strategy was working. They saw that, by the 1980s, an anti-Apartheid movement had emerged across the world, including in the United States, led by the Black community in the United States in particular, that had gotten to impose sanctions, that had led to divestment efforts. And it produced a virtuous cycle that made it easier for them to maintain their moral core. Now, Hamas has never had the same moral core that the A.N.C. had, to be clear. But there are many Palestinians who have spoken in the language of human rights and international law and coexistence and opposed violence against civilians and called for boycotts and called for sanctions and tried to go to the International Criminal Court and tried to go to the United Nations. Tragically, in my view, unlike what we were able to do in America in the 1980s, which was to strengthen and empower those people, those people have been shut down, not just defeated, but often criminalized. I’m not saying that everyone needs to sign up to every aspect of the boycott divestment sanction movement. But if there is no form of ethical or nonviolent Palestinian resistance that you support, then you were just telling Palestinians they should accept their oppression in silence, you are going to empower Hamas.

spencer ackerman

And not just accept their oppression in silence, disappear from the face of the Earth. Every single day Palestinians experience violence. That was true before Oct. 7. It is true certainly in the wake of it. What happened to a Palestinian nonviolent effort? Well, part of it is Israel killed those people. Israel put their leaders in jail. I’m so old that I remember — I guess back in the mid-2000s when people talked about the importance of releasing Marwan Barghouti from prison on the idea that he was a way out of the P.L.O. and Hamas in a different way.

ezra klein

Do you want to say who he is?

spencer ackerman

A Palestinian leader who tried to forge a different path, who emerged from conditions of violent resistance but was trying to move toward a different form of national struggle. And this also is an important point here. The United States, as a matter of policy, suppressed that. The United States rejected Palestinian aspirations at the United Nations, vetoed resolutions. Peter probably knows more than I do how many states in the United States it is forbidden to have any involvement with boycott, divestment and sanctions, where there are penalties for state interaction with those movements and those efforts. And more fundamentally, continued to fund and arm Israel and provide it diplomatic support while it suppressed legitimate Palestinian national aspirations. And so I find it a little frustrating, certainly not as frustrating as a Palestinian would, but frustrating to hear from people who have no intention of honoring and bringing about Palestinian national aspirations, that they just don’t do it the right way. The fact of the matter is people deserve freedom because they are people. And that I think speaks to a reality that we as Americans tend not to acknowledge.

ezra klein

And my sense, Spencer, is that in the same pier, there’s this very sharp break around the role America is trying to play. Barack Obama didn’t get a lot done here. But one thing he did try to do, more so than any president since Carter, was challenge Israel on the settlements. And I would say he had a showdown with Netanyahu on that and he lost.

spencer ackerman

Not only did he lose — I remember, in 2010, when Joe Biden went as an envoy to secure the first steps toward a return to the peace process. And Netanyahu’s response was to announce more settlement construction.

ezra klein

A very direct snub. I mean, that was very, very calculated.

spencer ackerman

And it was hard not to think about that as Netanyahu and Biden embraced. Forgive me for being the war on terror guy who constantly goes back to the war on terror, but among the things that happened during that period was the war on terror in which the position of the United States, certainly beginning in September of 2001, was that Israel was fighting in microcosm the circumstance that the United States was fighting. And accordingly, there was no appetite to prompt Israel to return to any kind of negotiating posture when the prevailing view in Washington, and certainly embraced by the Israelis because of how well it suited them, was that the Palestinians were no different, functionally, from Al Qaeda. And that was a false equivalence that many in American politics and media were not particularly inclined to question. And as those conditions continued, Israel built its wall around the West Bank, which was a term people policed very heavily so as not to call it a wall. And I think it’s very obvious that it was and remains a wall. That the United States reached the thing that we constantly talk about in this day and age not reaching, which is normalization. Normalization of the persistent immiseration of the Palestinian people. Normalization of the sense that I think Peter has discussed quite eloquently of — and Tareq Baconi cited as well — a certain equilibrium that we saw on Oct. 7 where it leads. That if you would simply find a way to ignore Palestinian national aspirations and the basic facts of Palestinian material life, that the region would simply move on, that Israel would find normalization from the Gulf States and eventually Saudi Arabia. And whatever else it is that Hamas might have sought to achieve, unrealistically through its attacks beginning on Oct. 7, that equilibrium has indeed been shattered. And the United States, were it to recognize itself as a central actor that it, in fact, is in this conflict, would come to a deep reckoning of the way in which it enabled this circumstance to take root and adjust course accordingly.

ezra klein

I’ve been very struck watching Biden. A lot of what he has said actually is opposed to things that have come out elsewhere in his administration I felt has been pretty on point. But the degree of immediate locking arms with Israel and Netanyahu, knowing him a bit, and knowing his history on these issues, knowing his fury after what happened with Netanyahu in the Obama administration, I’ve wondered a little bit about his longer term play. That something that was happening in Israeli-American politics is that Israel is becoming right-wing coded. It was becoming something that Democrats had more complicated feelings on. Netanyahu had embraced Trump very fulsomely. Joe Biden is a guy who likes to imagine himself like one of the great diplomatic presidents of all time. As a Senate Foreign Relations Chair, he likes doing his shuttle diplomacy. And he seems to me to be trying to rebuild a role for America as a broker, possibly at the cost of its capability of bringing together other players in the region. But trying to rebuild its influence in Israel, hopefully with, on his part, some end game. But that has struck me as a possible way of reading just the level of intense support and political capital he’s invested in this immediately.

spencer ackerman

The people who formed the highest echelons of the Biden administration were the people who formed the second highest echelons of the Obama administration. And particularly amongst his Middle East people, their takeaway from the experience is that Obama’s instincts throughout the Middle East failed and were a mess, that toward the end of the Obama administration, after the Iran deal, there was a strain that, I think it’s fair to say, the Biden administration has run with as the centrality of its foreign policy toward the Middle East. And that is, embrace the old autocrats as hard as you can. Embrace the Petro states as hard as you can. Recognize that nothing you will want to see accomplished in the rest of the world will happen unless you unwind things like the way that Biden called Saudi Arabia a pariah state. It took the better part of a year for that to unwind. And a central aspect of that experience was seeing the ways in which efforts by Obama to impose the barest outlines of a political settlement for a two-state solution on Israel came to nothing but tears, needless antagonism and struggle, and the acceleration of that what you call right-wing codedness. Biden wants none of that smoke. Absolutely none of it. I think it is fair to question, after Oct. 7, the degree to which that strategy lies in ruins to simply look past as so much of the world and look past Israeli apartheid and the conditions of Palestinian deprivation and consider that a footnote to a glorious history in which the United States has this seamless interoperable network — this is often how they describe it from a security perspective — in which it is the security guarantor of the Middle East, and relations in the region with a rising China remain commercial and transactional, and that will secure the American position in the Middle East for generations to come. It doesn’t look like that’s really working out. And we should also just say we have not seen the end of the way this war looks. Every day I wake up scared and checking the newsfeeds to see if a second front has opened up in Southern Lebanon. That’s a real possibility here. The United States has two aircraft carrier strike groups quite possibly to assist in an assault should Hezbollah decide to enter the war in force, at which point you really do have an expanded regional war that the United States is in directly. And I don’t know if the United States has really thought through the degree to which it itself is very close to being a combatant in this conflict.

ezra klein

I’m curious what you read and what the United States wants here?

peter beinart

I think the most generous interpretation is that Biden believes that if he hugs Netanyahu and he wins credibility among Israelis, he may have the leverage to, behind the scenes, restrain what Israel does, so it’s not totally apocalyptic. It doesn’t spur the regional war or the overthrow of the Jordanian regime or the overthrow of Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank. That he can do that behind the scenes. That he kind of reasons that Obama didn’t have credibility in Israel — partly because of who he was, but partly because of public confrontation — so he’s going to do the opposite. But I think history will not be kind to the Biden administration’s way of approaching with this. They just didn’t have any stomach for any political fight in Washington to do anything for the Palestinians and essentially acted as if that could just be managed as they went off to fight their new Cold War with China and then to deal with Russia. And they contributed to this feeling among Palestinians that they were being more and more marginalized, that they were more and more hopeless, and that contributed, that empowered Hamas to take this action. And so part of the problem is they have accepted a political reality in Washington that essentially says you can’t have a fight with Israel. But by accepting that political reality, they have also strengthened that political reality. If a Democratic president had tried to do something different, given what we see among polling shifts among Democrats out there in the country, and actually led, he could have potentially changed the politics. Instead, what Joe Biden has done is he’s essentially strengthened a kind of consensus in Washington that many grass roots Democrats don’t support. And by doing so, I think he contributed to this explosion.

ezra klein

But do you think it changes now? I mean, do you think there is something to the idea that if Biden is able to win back credibility for democratic administration in Israel at a point of weakness for Netanyahu, when the U.S. government at this point was doing a lot of deals and working with the Gulf States — I mean, the idea that the equilibrium — that you can just forget about the Palestinian problem — has been shattered is true in America, too. That’s true for the Biden administration, too. I do not want to suggest that all this ends in a happy ending. I basically couldn’t believe anything further from the truth. But I do wonder if there is not an opening here, if things do not go too far off the rails in the immediate near term, to try to begin the work that was being done before of are there not deals that can be made, are there not people who can be empowered, is there not some legacy other than the continuing dissolution of this?

peter beinart

I think it would be very difficult with this Israeli government given how radical it is. And I fear that the Biden administration, if it manages to somehow avert a regional catastrophe, will of go back and say, OK, things are now OK now. The best case scenario might be, in the short-term, that there is some Israeli election that produces some kind of political earthquake. Now, that political earthquake could lead Israel even further to the right. We have no idea really what it would mean. But things have been deeply destabilized. And in the best case scenario, perhaps you might, especially because of the forces that were leading against this judicial overhaul, that maybe there could be some new political leadership in Israel that Biden could work with and do something that no American government and no Israeli government has ever done, which is restrain settlement growth, for instance. We’ve never done that. Israel has never done that, even during the peace process. That would be, I think, the best case scenario. It wouldn’t even bring us close to some kind of resolution. But it might at least create some kind of hope for Palestinians that they’re not just looking into despair as far as the eye can see. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

One thing that was in the piece you wrote, Peter, is a kind of idea that I’ve been thinking about since then, of the tactics that generate a response, that generate a kind of success then empower the people behind them. And you get into these cycles, right? Hardliners have a tendency to empower hardliners. Hamas throws rockets at Israel and gets some concessions. Hamas kidnaps an Israeli soldier and actually does get a prisoner swap. And that makes Hamas look stronger. Netanyahu’s government is able to wall off the Palestinians, and build an Iron Dome, and fortify the wall, and attacks are going down and that makes him look stronger. Or similarly, there’s an attack and now you need the hard right, you need the more military-oriented leaders, because, of course, you have to avenge the attack. And so you write that in the case of South Africa, that ethical resistance elicited international support, and international support made ethical resistance easier to sustain. And in Israel today, the dynamic is almost exactly the opposite. So I guess this raises this kind of deep question for me, which is I’ve long ago given up on the idea that there is some kind of fantasy dealmaking to imagine here, that I can kind of in my head imagine the land swaps and the right of return dynamics and all the things that would get to a deal. I think the thing you’re getting at in that piece, which is really quite powerful, is that until there are different empowered actors, there can be no deal. You have to change the political economy of the whole thing. You have to change who has strength. And I’m curious how you think that gets done.

peter beinart

We’re so far away from it. But I do think that one thing would be really important is 20 percent of Israel’s citizens are Palestinians. They are a really important group of people. Because although they’re severely discriminated against, they’re the only Palestinians who actually have the ability to act politically, to vote. The problem in Israeli politics — one major problem is that there is no genuine joint Jewish and Palestinian party. The parties are essentially all based on tribe, on various different kinds of tribes. And so you don’t have a party that even models the vision of the kind of politics that I would ultimately like to see. And if such a party could emerge and speak to Israelis and Palestinians, because it would be composed of Israelis and Palestinians, and say the way we behave in this party, coming together around a vision of humanity and equality under the law and liberal democracy, and fighting for it together as Jews and Palestinians inside Israel, I think that could resonate around the whole world and show a model of what might be possible. We desperately need models of what’s possible now for people not to lose all hope.

spencer ackerman

I agree that it looks as far away as it’s ever looked. But at the same time, I remember that when the United States imposes conditions on its allies and foreign clients, quite a great deal that doesn’t seem possible could, in fact, become possible. If the United States is, as the Biden administration has done thus far, simply express solidarity with Israel, give it accelerated ammunition shipments, then we won’t have any of those incentives created. We won’t have any actors who could break this dynamic empowered. We won’t have movements and constituencies for Palestinian liberation taken seriously and sat across a negotiating table from Israel. I don’t pretend that my perspective holds much in the way of a constituency in Israel right now. So I want to speak with some humbleness. But the thing is what’s possible is very often different from what’s necessary. And only when people of conscience hold true to what’s necessary, can we start to expand the limits of what is possible, until finally a way pointing out of this horrific reality can come to pass. And that’s something that is not something that Israel would be granting Palestinians. It would be something Israel would be performing for the survival of its own people, the people who we have, particularly in the Jewish community in Israel and around the world, been agonizing over the fate of.

I want to make sure some of the competing Israeli narratives are felt here. And one of the very dominant ones has been that there were efforts towards peace, or many, many peace processes, and obviously the narratives of what happened at places like Camp David and in this or that negotiation are highly contested — I’m not going to try to untangle them here — but that it fundamentally, to many Israelis, didn’t work. There wasn’t enough of a negotiating partner. Intifadas got launched. There were still rockets coming over. There were suicide bombings. And then it seemed to me — and this was a very depressing thing to watch happen — that a new consensus emerged, like, we’re done with that. The far right in Israel was highly empowered. We’re going to cordon off Gaza, cordon off the West Bank, have a blockade on Gaza, build the Iron Dome, build the wall, have intelligence operations mow the lawn by which it was a very bloodless way of saying launch repeated attacks to try to degrade the capabilities of Hamas, in particular, and other terrorist groups. And that within that there are demands placed, if this is going to change, on the Palestinians, too. I mean, and particularly now that Israel has just suffered this attack. And so I’m curious how you think about that side of it as well. And in particular, what builds trust for Israelis?

peter beinart

Right. And that’s why I, like Spencer, am so afraid of the idea of mass ethnic cleansing, because, I think, if you’ve written off the possibility of giving people equality within the country in which they live, which is essentially Israel because they live under Israeli control in various ways, and you have given up on the idea of partition and says it’s no longer possible, and you’ve given up on this idea of what the Palestinian writer Tareq Baconi calls the kind of violent equilibrium in which you can manage this, then what are you left with but the idea of trying to get those people out of there. I would say, first of all, it is very important for Israeli Jews and people around the world to know that there are Palestinians who have condemned these attacks, who have said that it is fundamentally antithetical to them to take civilian life of any group. Ayman Odeh, for instance, who’s just about the most important — one of the most important Palestinian political leaders in Israel has said that unequivocally. Adalah, an organization of Palestinian Israelis. There have been people who have said that. I think it’s really important that we don’t lose their voices in this. On the question of what happened during all these negotiations, both Palestinians and Israeli Jews believed that the other side was not acting in good faith. And if you really go through all of the details, I think what you come to at the end of the day is that they had two different conceptions of what this partition would look like that could never be bridged. But since Netanyahu came back to power in 2009, we have not had an Israeli government that has been interested in a Palestinian state on any terms. So even if you say that Yasir Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas deserve blame for what happened in 2000, 2001, 2007, 2008 — and I think there is blame to go around — the problem with blaming the Palestinians since 2009 is there has been no Israeli partner to even test their willingness to accept the idea of a Palestinian state near the 1967 lines in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

ezra klein

So let me begin to bring this to a close, and not with imaginings of a deal that isn’t going to happen, but with a more direct question, which is — I agree with your point, Peter, that with this Israeli government it’s very hard to imagine that kind of change. Who are figures — political leaders, thinkers, people with a constituency of some sort — on both sides of the conflict who you all have seen, heard from, and who are the kind of people you wish would begin to hold more power? Are there people who are for you folks charting a pathway forward that has some glimmers of something different?

spencer ackerman

I think Ayman Odeh is someone who does not command a substantial constituency in Israel — and we shouldn’t underestimate the left’s nearly 20-year marginalization in Israel — but, as Peter pointed out earlier, is someone whose politics represents something outside of the zero-sum nature of what Israeli politics that we’re seeing with the Netanyahu government represents. And like Peter says, we don’t know the direction of a government that may take shape in response to fury at Netanyahu that Israelis have expressed for the last nearly two weeks over this. But that fury is not necessarily a left wing fury. That fury very often has to do with the ways in which Netanyahu’s gamble did not yield security. And the question is going to be what Israelis take away from that lesson. Was the failure in security simply a failure of sufficiently militarizing Israel toward the South and away from the West Bank, or was it a more fundamental failure in which the policy of keeping Hamas strong and funded in order to never have to divest Israel of the West Bank was the fundamental failure here?

ezra klein

Peter, do you have any other people who spring to mind in that?

peter beinart

Yes, I think I mentioned in passing this group, which is in English called “Standing Together,” led by Sally Abed and Alon-Lee Green and many others. It’s an organization of Israeli and Palestinian citizens who, under the most extraordinarily difficult circumstances, especially now where they’re literally facing state repression, have tried to offer a vision of Israeli Jews and Palestinians standing together for mutual safety, mutual equality and coexistence. And those people give me hope.

ezra klein

Are there any politicians in Israel that you find — and here I mean actually Jewish politicians. The collapse of the Israeli left has been so stark from when I started being involved in this issue in my 20s or in my teens. Does anybody feel to you like they have any hope of reviving something?

peter beinart

The problem is in this — I think in this idea of the Jewish left. We would not talk in the United States about the white left or the Christian left. Inherent in being in the left is you don’t stand for tribe. And the problem in Israeli politics is there is not a robust politics that essentially sees itself as neither Jewish, nor Palestinian. There is a Jewish member of the Knesset in the Hadash party, which is a mostly Palestinian party. That man, Ofer Cassif, was just basically banned from the Knesset for 45 days for public statements he made, just to give you a sense of how difficult it is to occupy that. But those are the people that I look to.

ezra klein

And then always our final question, what are three books you’d recommend to the audience? And Spencer, why don’t I start with you?

spencer ackerman

Sure. So three books, and I appreciate the question, Ezra. First, I would recommend reading “The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine,” by the historian Rashid Khalidi. That is a Palestinian — a very accessible Palestinian history as precis to the conflict beginning of the 20th century to the early 21st. A shattering book that people really ought to read is “An Oral History of the Palestinian Nakba.” That’s edited by Nahla Abdo and Nur Masalha. Reading the history from the people who experienced the Nakba around 1948 and periods both before and after is, for those who know Jewish history, shattering in its familiarity. And reading, as well, the accounts of people who survived the Nakba, who talk about how these were their neighbors, people that they loved, their children played with, who they had all sorts of social relationships with for a long period of time, turn on them and force them away is a shattering thing to remember and to hear. And then finally, I would recommend Benny Morris and my former Guardian colleague Ian Black’s book, “Israel’s Secret Wars,” which is a history of the rise of the Israeli intelligence services and their role in statecraft in Israel. Also has some simply incredible stories that are amazing to believe are true.

ezra klein

Peter?

peter beinart

Because this has been a conversation among Jews and I know you’re going to have Palestinian guests, I’m going to mention three books by Palestinians, not because there are not so many books by Israeli Jews that I love, but just because since Palestinians have often had, as Edward Said said this, not had this permission to narrate, I think it’s really important in this moment that their voices be elevated. The first is Edward Said’s classic book, “The Question of Palestine,” in 1979, which really lays out the Palestinian experience. And what I love about that book and find so moving about it is it’s a very, very profound critique of Zionism. And yet, Said is such a humanist that he’s also able to describe in that book to understand why Zionism was so appealing to so many Jews and why many Jews found it liberating even as he found it to be oppressive, and Palestinians did. The second is Raja Shehadeh’s memoir, “Strangers in the House.” Spencer mentioned the Nakba. This is the story of growing up in a family of people who were expelled. And it gives you an intimate glimpse into that refugee experience, which is so central to the Palestinian experience, and yet I feel like so often is missing from the American discourse about Israel-Palestine. And the third is — we’ve mentioned Tareq Baconi before — Tareq Baconi’s book, “Hamas Contained.” It’s a book about Hamas, which has no illusions, which is very, very critical in parts, but describes the history of Hamas as a political organization that one can understand certain decisions it’s made in response to certain incentives. And if there is to be a better future for Israelis and Palestinians than the one that Hamas envisions, part of that will require understanding Hamas better so that Jews and Palestinians together can create better alternatives.

677,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/11/world/middleeast/here-is-the-latest-on-the-fighting.html,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel formed an emergency government on Wednesday, adding two opposition lawmakers — both former army chiefs — to his cabinet. The new wartime cabinet, including the prime minister, Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, and Benny Gantz, a senior opposition lawmaker and former defense minister, pledged to crush Hamas.

“Every Hamas member is a dead man,” Mr. Netanyahu said, in an evening address with Mr. Gallant and Mr. Gantz. “Hamas is ISIS, and we will crush and eliminate it just as the world crushed and eliminated ISIS.”

Mr. Gantz added, “Israel is in one of its darkest hours ever.”

As the leaders presented a united front, Mr. Netanyahu also listed some of the atrocities he said Hamas terrorists had committed: Boys and girls had been found shot in the head, people had been burned alive, women had been raped and killed, and soldiers had been beheaded.

Analysts said the infusion of military expertise would give the government greater legitimacy to make tough wartime decisions, including whether to invade Gaza, or even southern Lebanon."

For two days, Israeli troops have fought to expel Palestinian militants from Israeli territory, battling in firefights between homes, ducking under rocket fire and striking Gazan cities from the sky. In what officials described as the worst attack on Israel in decades, militants on Saturday infiltrated more than 20 Israeli towns and army bases. Read our timeline.

As of last night, at least 700 Israelis and 413 Palestinians had been killed, and an Israeli defense official said at least 150 Israelis had been taken hostage. The U.N. humanitarian agency said almost 125,000 Palestinians were displaced in Gaza after Israeli airstrikes targeted houses and apartment complexes, in some cases before notifying residents.

Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, warned of hard days ahead. “We are embarking on a long and difficult war that was forced on us by a murderous Hamas attack,” he said, referring to the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip. Israel’s military has begun its offensive phase, he added, “which will continue with neither limitations nor respite until the objectives are achieved.”

On the ground: Israeli tanks could be seen crossing farmland in parts of southern Israel, heading south toward Gaza, and the military ordered an evacuation of civilians from 24 villages near the Gaza border, a possible prelude to a ground assault."
679,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/world/middleeast/photos-show-an-explosion-has-caused-heavy-damage-in-gazas-jabaliya-neighborhood.html,"Photographs taken on Tuesday showed at least one large crater and significant damage to buildings at the Jabaliya neighborhood in northern Gaza, home of a long-established refugee camp.

The Gazan health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, said the damage was the result of an attack by Israel that killed and wounded “hundreds” of people, a statement that could not be immediately verified. A spokesman for Israel’s military said it was looking into the reports.

Dr. Marwan Sultan, medical director of the Indonesian Hospital, which is near Jabaliya, said that his facility was receiving hundreds of injured people, and that dozens more were dead.

Photos by news agencies Tuesday afternoon showed civilian rescuers picking through the rubble of shattered buildings, some of which were three or four stories, and civilians carrying casualties.

Scores of people stood around a crater, which was several yards deep and contained large shards of concrete. It was not immediately clear from the pictures what had caused the crater, or exactly when it had been created. Other craters were visible in the background.

There was no crater in the area of the explosion on Monday, according to a satellite image of the camp by the private company Planet Labs.

A later photograph published by Reuters showed a Red Crescent ambulance on a street and more than 30 white sheets wrapped around what appeared to be bodies laid on the ground.

Jabaliya is the largest of the Gaza Strip’s eight refugee camps and is populated by people who were displaced from what is now Israel in the 1940s and their descendants. While it is called a camp, the area is in fact built up and densely populated, rather than a tent city. The camp covers an area of 1.4 square kilometers and is just to the north of Gaza City, the largest urban settlement in Gaza.

The United Nations says that as of this year, there were more than 116,000 people registered at the camp with UNRWA, the U.N. agency that aids Palestinians, though it was unclear how many have left in recent weeks.

On Friday, Israel began an invasion of Gaza, in retaliation for the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, in which 1,400 people were killed. Israeli forces have been advancing toward Gaza City from both the north and the east amid a barrage of airstrikes that have caused widespread casualties.

Israel’s military has repeatedly warned civilians to leave northern Gaza and head to the south of the enclave. But it has also conducted bombings in the south.

More than 8,500 people have been killed as Israel has carried out its campaign of retaliatory airstrikes, including more than 3,500 children, according to the Gazan Health Ministry.

The Israeli military advanced deeper into Gaza yesterday, approaching Gaza City from three directions. Israel has provided only limited details about the invasion, but photos and videos verified by The New York Times, as well as satellite imagery, showed troops and armored vehicles closing in on the city, Gaza’s largest, from the north, east and south. Israel has also continued to batter the territory with airstrikes.

At a news conference, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, asked other nations to back the country in its fight against Hamas. He forcefully rejected calls for a cease-fire, saying they were “calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism.” He added, “The future of our civilization is at stake.”

Asked about the civilian death toll from airstrikes, Netanyahu said that “not a single civilian has to die,” accusing Hamas of preventing them from leaving the areas of conflict. Israeli strikes and a ground offensive have killed more than 8,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there."

Outrage has rippled through the Arab world over a blast that killed hundreds at a hospital in Gaza. President Biden, on a wartime trip to Israel, firmly backed the Israeli government’s assertion that Israel did not cause the hospital explosion, which U.S. and Israeli intelligence officials said appeared to be the result of an errant rocket fired by Palestinian fighters.

Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls Gaza and is battling Israel, has blamed the explosion on an Israeli airstrike — a claim widely accepted across the Middle East, where many people see Israel as an occupying power backed by the U.S.

Heading home, Biden vowed that the U.S. would stand fast with Israel in its war against Hamas. He also unveiled a newly brokered deal to allow international humanitarian aid into Gaza from Egypt, offering the first hint of relief to a crisis that has left the enclave’s two million residents facing desperate shortages. He also announced $100 million in U.S. aid to help civilians in Gaza and the West Bank.

Urging restraint: Biden cautioned Israelis to not be so consumed by rage that they make mistakes. “After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States,” he said. “While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.” (Sign up for our war briefing for more coverage.)"

He said that the attacks by Hamas that had left 1,400 people dead in Israel on Oct. 7 were “appalling” but that they did not justify the “collective punishment” of civilians in the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli military significantly stepped up its bombardment.

Israel said it had struck more than 700 targets in Gaza in the past two days. The Gaza Health Ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, said it had recorded the highest single-day death toll of the war yesterday: at least 704 people killed in dozens of strikes on homes, a refugee camp and other places. It was not possible to independently verify the toll.

Civilian casualties in Gaza — where a slow trickle of aid trucks have done little to stem a spiraling humanitarian crisis — were highlighted by President Emmanuel Macron of France during a visit to Israel. He met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and said his country stood with the Israelis, but added that the fight against terrorism must be “without mercy but not without rules.”

John Kirby, a White House spokesman, said the Biden administration did not support a cease-fire because it would only benefit Hamas and acknowledged that civilian casualties were all but inevitable as Israel tries to push Hamas out of Gaza."

The health ministry said that Israeli airstrikes had killed at least 436 people “in the past hours,” bringing the death toll to more than 5,000 since Oct. 7, when Israel began launching airstrikes in retaliation for an attack by Hamas that killed 1,400 people.

Hamas, which controls Gaza, released two additional hostages yesterday, according to the group and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Their release, which Hamas said was for “humanitarian and health reasons,” came three days after the group set free an Israeli-American mother and daughter. Israel raised the number of people kidnapped to 222, 10 more than a day earlier.

The trip will be a remarkable gamble, a demonstration of U.S. solidarity with Israel aimed at Syria, Iran and Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based, Iran-backed militant group fighting Israel, at a time of increasing anxiety about a regional war. The trip will also tie Biden, and the U.S., to the bloodshed in Gaza, where two million people are trapped and critical supplies are dwindling.

Israel has retaliated forcefully to the Hamas assault, the deadliest attack on Israel in its history, in which more than 1,400 people were killed and nearly 200 hostages taken. Hundreds of Israeli airstrikes have pounded Gaza, and Israel says it has killed at least six senior Hamas leaders so far.

The New York law firm said that two of the students held leadership roles in groups that signed a letter at Columbia and that one was affiliated with the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups, which jointly wrote a letter that held the “Israeli regime” responsible for the deadly violence.

692,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/learning/do-you-ever-feel-pressure-to-post-about-your-outrage-online.html,"These days, when tragedy strikes or a divisive political issue makes headlines, ordinary people, along with celebrities and corporations, are often expected to post their reactions on social media. Have you felt this pressure with any recent event, perhaps after a school shooting, during the Black Lives Matter protests or now, during the Israel-Hamas war?

Do you think expressing your opinion publicly is important in times like these?

In “I Don’t Have to Post About My Outrage. Neither Do You.” Elizabeth Spiers, a contributing Opinion writer, argues that not posting may sometimes be the wisest choice:

I am neither Jewish nor Palestinian, and none of my six regular gigs have anything to do with foreign policy, but the other day I opened Twitter (now called X) after some time offline to find people I don’t know demanding that I make a public statement about what’s happening in the Middle East. It seemed that most of the people on social media had made a statement, including various corporate brands, celebrities and miscellaneous lifestyle influencers. American Eagle’s chief marketing officer posted to LinkedIn that the company had changed its Times Square billboard to an image of the Israeli flag. “Praying for Israel,” Justin Bieber posted on Instagram, over an image (later deleted) of what was actually Gaza. But not everyone was taking a side. As I scrolled through my timeline, I saw lots of random citizens being told that if they didn’t speak out, they, too, would have blood on their hands. People speaking from both the right and the left seemed to attribute my silence to depraved indifference to human suffering, though they were divided on which humans were suffering. As it happens, I had been dealing with shingles (zero stars, do not recommend) and the depression I struggle with periodically. I was tired and overwhelmed, as are a great many other people. But the voices yelling at me and anyone else who failed to post seemed to believe that not making a statement was itself a statement — and an immoral one, at that. There’s a facile version of taking a stand on social media that generates righteous back patting but reduces complex issues to a simple yes or no. Taking simplistic stands can also lead to twisting words. Concern for Palestinians is portrayed as support for Hamas or hatred toward Israel or Jews in general. Anger about Hamas’s deadly attacks on Israeli citizens — or any mention of antisemitism — is portrayed as denigrating the dignity of all Palestinian lives. This kind of thinking is deeply unserious and further fuels hostilities, warping nuanced positions into extremism and mistaking tweet-length expressions of outrage for brave action in the face of atrocity.

Ms. Spiers continues:

Knee-jerk social media posts are not what bother me most, though. Instead, it’s the idea that not posting is wrong somehow — that everyone needs to speak, all the time. It discourages shutting up and listening and letting the voices that matter the most be heard over the din. It implies it’s not OK to have any uncertainty about what’s going on or any kind of moral analysis that does not lend itself to presentation in a social media post. It does not leave time or space for people to process traumatic events in the sanctuary of their own minds or to gather more information before pronouncing a judgment. It pressures people who don’t have an opinion yet or are working out what they think to manufacture one and present it to a jury of total strangers on the internet who will render an instant verdict on its propriety.

Students, read the entire article and then tell us:

In the wake of big and emotionally charged news events, such as the Israel-Hamas War, have you felt pressured to post your reaction online? To express outrage or sympathy? To take a stance or a side? What is that like for you?

If you don’t feel pressure to post online, what about among your peers? In this conflict, or others, have those around you asked that you make your opinion known? How do you feel about this expectation?

What are your thoughts on the author’s argument? Do you agree that not everyone has to share their outrage publicly? Or do you believe that not expressing an opinion is wrong? Explain.

In times like these, do you expect companies or celebrities to make a statement on where they stand? Do you find these statements helpful? Why or why not? If not, whom do you want to hear from?

Hundreds of people were killed by an explosion at a hospital in Gaza City where thousands of civilians had been sheltering last night, local officials said, a devastating loss of life that ignited protests against Israel and the U.S. across the Arab world. The Health Ministry in Gaza said the number of casualties was expected to rise.

Photographs and videos showed bloodied and charred bodies strewn across the courtyard of the Ahli Arab Hospital. Blankets, backpacks and mattresses lay nearby, traces of families who had come to seek refuge at the hospital after their homes had been destroyed.

Palestinian officials said the blast was caused by an Israeli airstrike. Israeli officials said the explosion was the result of a failed rocket attack by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group aligned with Hamas, which a spokesman for the group denied. The Times could not verify either claim.

Context: The deadly explosion came as conditions in Gaza grew ever more desperate. Food, fuel and water supplies are dwindling fast. Israel said yesterday that it had intensified its bombing in the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah. Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed 2,800 people and wounded 10,000 others, Palestinian officials said, and Israel’s orders to evacuate northern Gaza have displaced at least 600,000, according to the U.N."

With the House rudderless and paralyzed following Mr. McCarthy’s removal last week, the California Republican worked to project normalcy and leadership in the face of the war unfolding in Israel, after an invasion by the Palestinian militant group Hamas that has led to hundreds of deaths and the capture of scores of civilian Israeli hostages. He summoned reporters to the Capitol to lay out a plan to defend Israel and rescue American captives.

The appearance had all the trappings of the job he just lost; Mr. McCarthy spoke from behind a podium in the Rayburn Room, where the speaker often holds official ceremonies, and used the language of a party leader during a crisis.

“Now is the time for action,” he said, adding, “We must be there for our friend Israel.”

In frantic talks, and with an Israeli ground invasion looming, officials from the U.S. and Middle Eastern countries, including Egypt, sought to ease what Israeli officials have called the “siege” of Gaza. After days of acute water shortages, Israel has agreed to restore water to a pipeline that served a southern part of the enclave, a top U.S. official said. Read the latest from the crisis.

As Israeli troops massed on the border, more than two million Gaza residents endured a panicked countdown to the expected start of a ground invasion of the north. Israel, mobilized for war and torn between angst and anger since the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, has called up 360,000 military reservists for duty. Its round-the-clock bombings of Gaza have continued apace.

The U.N. has estimated that nearly a million Gazans have been displaced, as Israel calls on residents of the northern part of the enclave to move to the south. Many say that would be impossible, not least for the patients at Al Shifa Hospital, the Gaza Strip’s largest medical complex.

Geopolitics: President Biden warned Israel not to reoccupy Gaza, in his first significant public effort to restrain the U.S. ally since the Hamas assault. Israel’s operations have come under criticism from its neighbor Egypt and from China, both of which have said that they went beyond mere self-defense."

The leaders of the 27 E.U. nations called yesterday for a break in the fighting in Gaza to address a dire humanitarian crisis inside the territory. Their statement came hours after the Israeli military said it had briefly sent tanks into Gaza in preparation for the next stage of fighting.

The incursion by Israeli forces was at least their second limited ground raid in Gaza, after some troops briefly entered the territory two weeks ago. Although details of the incursion remained scarce, a video released by Israel’s military showed its tanks firing inside an area of Gazan territory, according to an examination of the footage by The New York Times.

Nearly three weeks after the war began, it remains unclear whether or when Israel will launch a ground invasion of Gaza.

Aid, especially fuel, is critically needed in Gaza, where resources have dwindled amid a blockade by Israel. U.N.R.W.A., the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees, said it had begun significantly reducing its operations in the Gaza Strip after nearly exhausting its fuel reserves."

The Red Cross confirmed their release, saying that it had helped to transfer the women out of Gaza this evening.

The Israeli prime minister’s office identified the women as Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, who were released three days after Hamas set free an Israeli-American mother and her daughter. More than 220 others are believed to be held captive in Gaza, a tally that has grown as the Israeli military has collected more information.

The Biden administration pushed Israel to delay a ground invasion of Gaza, arguing that more time was needed for hostage negotiations. U.S. officials are also hoping to buy time to allow more humanitarian aid to reach people in Gaza, where dozens of trucks carrying food, water and other supplies have arrived in recent days.

Israel’s military said it had struck over 300 targets in Gaza today, in one of the biggest barrages yet of its war.

As Simmons noted, Harris rose through California politics as a prosecutor. She was either the district attorney of San Francisco or the state attorney general for 13 straight years.

To get elected to these positions, lawyers usually do not need to lay out a broad vision of society in the way that governors or members of Congress do. Prosecutors tend to focus on specific policies, while other politicians focus on reflecting — and shaping — the zeitgeist. “Often in the White House, national leaders have to base their arguments on emotion and gut,” Simmons said, “and as a prosecutor that’s not the job.”

Harris was an effective prosecutor. As district attorney, she lifted the office’s conviction rate and wrote a book whose title popularized a phrase: “Smart on Crime.” As attorney general, she cracked down on for-profit colleges, mortgage lenders and drug cartels. After winning a U.S. Senate seat in 2016, she used her interrogation skills to confront Trump administration officials and nominees in hearings.

“Based on what I’ve seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you,” Biden told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in Tel Aviv.

American officials said that multiple strands of intelligence — including infrared satellite data — indicated that the blast had been caused by the launch of a rocket or a missile from Palestinian fighter positions within Gaza. A spokeswoman for the National Security Council said its “current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information, is that Israel is not responsible.” (Here is a map of the hospital and what we know about the blast.)

Palestinian officials blamed the explosion on an Israeli airstrike, an assertion that was disputed by the Israeli military, which said it had been caused by a malfunctioning rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group allied with Hamas.

In Alabama, the U.S. Supreme Court forced officials to redraw the map to add one majority Black (and therefore Democratic-leaning) district. In New York, Democrats are trying to redraw the map to flip several seats. In Florida, Georgia and Louisiana, other legal challenges could help Democrats.

If everything goes Democrats’ way, roughly 10 House seats could become meaningfully easier to win. Next year, the party needs to net only five seats to reclaim the House. New York alone could switch six seats from leaning Republican to leaning Democrat.

Not every court case is hurting Republicans. In North Carolina, a ruling from the state’s Supreme Court will allow Republican lawmakers to redraw the map to move several seats their way. In South Carolina, liberal groups have taken the state’s Republican gerrymander to the U.S. Supreme Court; but the court’s conservative majority appears likely to side with Republicans, based on oral arguments last week."

The agreement to explore the use of Russian funds to help pay for Ukraine’s reconstruction followed months of discussions among the world’s most advanced economies, who have jointly frozen about $300 billion of Russian central bank assets.

Last year, this school system outperformed all 50 states on reading and math scores for both eighth graders and fourth graders.

Hamas said that it released the women for “humanitarian reasons.” The group is believed to have taken more than 200 more hostages. Most were captured from small Israeli towns near the border with Gaza; others were abducted from military bases or from an all-night music festival. They include civilians, soldiers, peace activists, grandparents and a 9-month-old baby.

President Biden, who earlier today formally asked Congress for billions of dollars in emergency funding for Israel and Gaza, said that the U.S. had worked with Qatar to secure the release of the Raanans. He asked the public to respect their privacy “as they recover and heal.”

Pentagon officials have attributed the attacks to Iran-backed militias.

But the tit-for-tat raised questions about whether the airstrikes that were carried out after a flurry of rocket and drone attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria can achieve one of their major goals: to deter further attacks.

Yellen arrives in Morocco this week to meet with her international counterparts, she will be representing a nation that has led the world’s post-pandemic economic recovery but is now struggling with potentially destabilizing political dysfunction.

America came perilously close to defaulting on its debt over the summer and tiptoed toward a government shutdown last month as Republicans fought over the proper levels of federal spending and whether to bankroll more aid to Ukraine. Those events culminated in last week’s ouster of Representative Kevin McCarthy as House speaker, a development that is raising questions about whether the United States can actually govern itself, let alone lead the world.

The political dynamic is expected to strain the credibility of the United States at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which begin on Monday in Marrakesh. Ms. Yellen is expected to press European governments to provide more funding for Ukraine and push creditors like China to relieve the debts of poor countries, including many African nations.

The meetings are taking place amid heightened global uncertainty because of the weekend attacks that Hamas waged upon Israel, which threaten to spiral into a regional conflict.

The Biden administration is pushing for Congress to take up an emergency assistance package that would pair support for Ukraine and Israel, but its fate remains highly uncertain. Legislative activity in the House has been at a standstill since Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, was ousted as speaker two weeks ago.

Chances are, it would have taken less time than it does today.

The scheduled flight time between Los Angeles and New York, for example, has become about 30 minutes longer. Aviation technology has not advanced in ways that speed the trip, and the skies have become so crowded that pilots reroute planes to avoid traffic. Nearly every other part of the trip also lasts longer than it would have a few decades ago, thanks to traffic on the roads and airport security. All told, a cross-country trip could take a few more hours today than it would have in the 1970s.

Shorter trips also take more time. Auto traffic in almost every metro area has worsened, and the country has done little to improve its rail network. In 1969, Metroliner trains made two-and-a-half-hour, nonstop trips between Washington and New York. Today, there are no nonstop trains on that route, and the fastest trip, on Acela trains, takes about 20 minutes longer than the Metroliner once did.

The speed at which people can get from one place to another is one of the most basic measures of a society’s sophistication. It affects economic productivity and human happiness; academic research has found that commuting makes people more unhappy than almost any other daily activity. Yet in one area of U.S. travel after another, progress has largely stopped over the past half-century."

Election Day is still several days away, but voters in New York can get a head start on Saturday, when early voting begins.

There are some interesting New York City Council races on the ballot. One features two sitting council members who are fighting bitterly over a redrawn district in southern Brooklyn; one of the candidates switched parties and is now running as a Republican. Another face-off pits two newcomers in a nearby district that was recently created to amplify the voices of Asian voters.

But for most New Yorkers, it will be a relatively quiet Election Day, with no presidential, governor or mayoral races on the ballot this year.

What is on the ballot this year?

Your ballot might include races for the City Council, district attorney, judges and two statewide ballot measures."

The councilwoman, Inna Vernikov, who represents southern Brooklyn neighborhoods including Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay, turned herself in at the 70th Precinct with her lawyer shortly before 3 a.m., according to a police spokeswoman.

Ms. Vernikov, 39, who has a license to carry a gun, surrendered her weapon — a Smith & Wesson 9-millimeter pistol — and her permit, police officials said. She was “observing a pro-Palestine protest” when she was seen with the butt end of a firearm “protruding from the front portion of her pants,” the police spokeswoman said.

New York issues permits to carry concealed firearms only; openly carrying a firearm is not allowed. A state law passed last year prohibits people from carrying guns in “sensitive locations,” a category that includes protests and rallies."

They spent decades building a labor movement that, despite many short-term defeats, ultimately changed public opinion, won elections and remade federal policy to put workers and corporations on a more equal footing. The rise of the labor movement from the 1930s through the 1950s led to incomes rising even more rapidly for the poor and middle class than for the rich, and to the white-Black wage gap shrinking.

One big lesson I took from my research was the unparalleled role of labor unions in combating inequality (a role that more Americans seem to have recognized recently).

There are plenty of other examples of grass-roots movements remaking American life. The civil-rights and women’s movements of the 1960s also overcame long odds, as did the disability-rights movement of the 1970s and the marriage-equality movement of the 2000s.

Other examples come from the political right. In the 1950s and 1960s, a group of conservatives, including Milton Friedman and Robert Bork, began trying to sell the country on the virtues of a low-tax, light-regulation economy. For years, they struggled to do so and were frustrated by their failures. Friedman kept a list of newspapers and magazines that did not even review his first major book.

But the conservatives kept trying — and the oil crisis that began 50 years ago last week eventually helped them succeed. A politician who embraced their ideas, Ronald Reagan, won the presidency and moved the U.S. closer to the laissez-faire ideal than almost any other country."

President Biden is set to issue an executive order on artificial intelligence on Monday, in his first effort to regulate how U.S. companies develop it and how regulators oversee the technology. The order will create standards for American companies and public agencies.

Its release is intended to establish the U.S. as the global leader in regulating the fast-growing tech, coming just days before the British government hosts an international summit meeting on A.I. safety.

Biden will invoke the Defense Production Act, which lets the president mobilize U.S. industry to support national defense. The order will require companies developing A.I. that “poses a serious risk to national security, national economic security, or national public health and safety” to notify the government when training their systems.

The most advanced A.I. products will have to be tested to ensure they can’t be used to make biological or nuclear weapons, and the findings must be shared with the government. The order will recommend that content created by A.I. systems will need to be labeled to minimize the spread of “deep fakes” or disinformation, a key concern in the lead-up to next year’s election."

The U.S. actions add to numerous existing measures to prevent and penalize Iran’s efforts to buy or sell technology or equipment related to its missile and drone programs, which are among the most sophisticated in the region.

In a statement on Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said the new penalties on several individuals and companies were meant to address “one of the greatest challenges to international peace and security.”

Mr. Blinken said that Iranian missiles posed a threat to Israel and Gulf Arab countries, and noted that Iran had transferred lethal drones to Russia, which had used them to kill civilians and destroy infrastructure in Ukraine.

There had to be “a mechanism to guarantee Iranian supply,” they wrote, a position plainly sympathetic to Tehran’s interests.

At the time, Esfandiary was a research associate at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and Tabatabai was a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center. But both women also belonged to the Iran Experts Initiative. According to blockbuster reporting in Semafor and Iran International, it was a high-level informal influence operation, involving a handful of scholars of Iranian descent, that was conceived and manipulated by the Iranian regime.

Another well-known participant in the I.E.I. was Ali Vaez, now the Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. Over several years, the trio wrote guest essays (including in The Times) and gave scores of interviews to major Western media outlets, making them unusually influential in the debates about Iran.

Vaez is also close to Robert Malley, who helped lead the Obama administration’s negotiations over the nuclear deal. Malley returned to government as the Biden administration’s special envoy to Iran.

The Gazan health authorities said that the explosion, which occurred at Ahli Arab Hospital, had been caused by an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli military said it was caused by a rocket fired by a Palestinian armed group that malfunctioned after launching.

The explosion immediately raised the stakes for Biden’s trip to Israel and Jordan, where he was expected to try to de-escalate the crisis. Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, called off a trip to Jordan, where he had been scheduled to meet with Biden.

The hospital explosion compounded the escalating humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. Even before the blast, rescuers were struggling to free more than a thousand people trapped under rubble, and fights were breaking out over loaves of bread."

What do you want us to do?” It’s against that culture of “You’re going to beat this.”

“The In-Between” also has to do with the experience of being in between uncertainty and knowing. But you write, “I do believe that our loved ones come to get us when we pass.” So where is the uncertainty?

The uncertainty I have is what after this life looks like. I feel like there is something beyond, but I don’t know what it is. So the conclusion I’ve come to is whatever is next cannot be explained with the language and the knowledge that we have here on Earth.

Have you thought about what a good death would be for you?

I want a living funeral. I don’t want people to say, “This is my favorite memory of her,” when I’m gone. There have been times when patients have shared with me that they don’t think anyone cares about them. Then I’ll go to their funeral and listen to the most beautiful eulogies. I believe they can still hear it and are aware of it, but I’m also like, Gosh, I wish that before they died, they heard you say these things. That’s what I want.

In reaching a tentative contract with the U.A.W., Ford has moved to make peace with restive employees, one of the most costly problems it has faced in recent years.

With that in mind, investors are weighing how much this week’s preliminary deal might weigh on the automaker as it deals with a different major issue: slower-than-expected demand for electric vehicles. The stakes are high, as the U.A.W. pushes for similar concessions from Ford’s rivals as they confront the same challenges.

The new contract could cost Ford up to $2 billion annually over four years, according to Barclays analysts, or about 1 percent of sales. The company said it would look to offset those costs elsewhere.

Employees were jubilant about the preliminary deal, which includes a 25 percent pay increase over the life of the contract and improvements on job security, pensions and more. “This is the best contract I have seen in my 30 years with Ford,” one worker, Robert Carter, told The Times."

Thanks to a 15-second clock that prevents players from dawdling between pitches, the average game lasted just two hours and 40 minutes this season, down a remarkable 24 minutes from last season.

Major League Baseball has trumpeted this change with television commercials. Journalists have praised it for speeding up a hidebound sport. Fans seem to have noticed, too: Attendance rose 10 percent, to its highest level in six years.

The shorter game times will help more fans enjoy the sport’s semifinals, known as the League Championship Series, which begin tonight with an intra-Texas rivalry between the Astros and the Texas Rangers. Tomorrow night, the other series — between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Philadelphia Phillies — begins.

There will be plenty of good stories over the next couple weeks. The Astros could become the first repeat champions in more than two decades. The Rangers have never won a World Series.

Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana, with all 220 Republicans in favor and all 209 Democrats in opposition, was elected as the 56th speaker of the House of Representatives.

Johnson, 51, is an unusual pick: He is little-known and less experienced than all his recent predecessors. His elevation now places a socially conservative lawyer who opposes abortion rights and same-sex marriage, and who played a leading role in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election, second in line to the presidency.

Yet unlike the three nominees before him, Johnson was able to secure the support of both hard-right and mainstream Republicans. Many of them, worn down by a brutal stretch of leaderless infighting, jumped to their feet to celebrate his election. Democrats were sharply critical, with one leader saying that the speaker race had devolved into a contest over “who can appease Donald Trump.”

Analysis: Johnson, who wrote a brief offering a legal justification for trying to overturn the 2020 election, is fundamentally more right-wing than the ousted speaker, Kevin McCarthy. His podcast, “Truth Be Told,” offers an extended window into his politics."

Hopes are high that aid trucks will be able to cross into Gaza tomorrow, however details of how and when the desperately needed food and medicine will be delivered have yet to be disclosed.

Under the agreement, the U.N. flag would be raised at the Rafah crossing along Gaza’s border with Egypt to protect against attacks, and international observers would inspect aid trucks before they entered the territory to ensure they are not carrying weapons.

International pressure to secure an aid route has been growing, and previous reports of imminent agreements to ease the backup at Gaza’s border with Egypt — both for people and aid — have failed to materialize. Britain’s prime minister met with Israel’s president today and said that they had “agreed on the importance of getting urgent humanitarian support to ordinary Palestinians in Gaza.” The U.S. State Department also said that it held discussions with Israeli and Egyptian officials today in an effort to get the crossing opened “soon.”

The first hotel I ever fell in love with was the Metropole, an old-world gem in Vietnam’s capital, Hanoi. My wife and I stayed there in 2007 on a break from covering the war in Iraq, and between the plush beds, the deep-ended pool in a quiet courtyard, and the rich history of the place as a hub of activity during the Vietnam War, we were smitten.

When we returned to Hanoi recently, we stayed there again, and quite unexpectedly, we found an Australian story for the ages — a story that confirmed my appreciation for the secrets that hotels hold, and the way Australians make their way through the world.

It has to do with a bunker.

When we checked in, we were asked if we wanted to join a free tour. So, on our last night, we followed a guide named Tom on an hourlong historical extravaganza that traced the hotel’s role. Built by the French in 1901, it served as a stand-in embassy for several countries during the Vietnam War. And because the Metropole held diplomats, combatants and bombs steered clear, making the hotel a relatively safe resting place for dignitaries and celebrities as well.

But in 1965, as the war intensified, the hotel’s managers decided to add an extra layer of protection: a five-room bunker abutting one edge of the pool. Tom told us it was used through at least the end of 1972, when Joan Baez, the American folk singer, arrived with a peace delegation that coincided with a major American attack.

And Johnson is much closer to the House’s hard-right faction than McCarthy was.

“I believe history will assess these three weeks as the most productive weeks of the 118th Congress,” Gaetz told The Wall Street Journal yesterday. “Because now we have both a man and a plan.”

Johnson had little national profile until he emerged as the leading candidate for speaker on Tuesday night. Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said yesterday morning that she would have to Google him. This obscurity became an advantage for him.

Lester, a longtime Princeton professor, coined a phrase to describe wage negotiations between an employer and a worker: the “range of indeterminacy.” It captures the fact that wages are not a reflection simply of market forces, like a worker’s productivity or a company’s profits. In the real world, similar workers often earn different wages. Their wages fall somewhere in Lester’s range of indeterminacy.

Why? Most workers don’t know exactly how valuable their contributions are and therefore what their true market wage should be.

Company executives typically don’t know either, but the executives do have more information — about how much money different workers make and how productive each is. Employers also have more leverage. Companies employ many workers, and losing one of them is usually manageable. For most workers, by contrast, quitting over a pay dispute can create financial hardship."

Congress approved a stopgap deal last month to keep the federal government open, but it excluded a request from President Biden to give Ukraine another round of funding. And as the House of Representatives decides who will be its next speaker, some Republicans are digging in against sending more money to Kyiv.

Congress has approved about $113 billion in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Nearly $62 billion of that has gone to the Defense Department, which uses the money allocated by Congress to contract with domestic arms manufacturers to restock the supplies it has sent to Ukraine from its own stockpiles.

If Congress doesn’t approve more aid, Ukraine has some breathing space. Under previous spending bills passed by Congress, Mr. Biden can still draw about $5.6 billion in matériel from the military’s reserves (mostly thanks to a Pentagon accounting error that overvalued aid that has already gone to Ukraine)."

Universities helped create the expectation that donations come with influence. Like most nonprofits, U.S. universities foster relationships with some donors by offering them seats on the board of the trustees. The job comes with real power: Trustees vote on decisions like tenure and the selection of the university president. For smaller donors, schools sometimes offer membership to alumni councils or advisory circles, which don’t come with fiduciary responsibilities but provide a platform for influencing decisions.

The question is how far the influence of individual donors should extend. “The job of a college or university president is very hard because, on the one hand, he or she has to keep the trustees happy — because they are big givers and because they can fire the president,” Edward Rock, a professor of law at New York University who specializes in corporate governance, said. “At the same time, he or she has to make sure that the university’s academic mission is not compromised by external forces, whether they be political forces or economic forces.”

This potential conflict is not new. In 1995, Yale returned a $20 million gift from a billionaire alumnus after he demanded selection of professors in the Western civilization program he funded. Leaders of Penn’s faculty senate argued in a letter this week that donors pushing for the university’s president and chairman to resign over a Palestinian literature festival that was held on campus, which the donors say presented antisemitic ideas, had similarly gone too far.

I’ve written before about right-wing claims to that effect, and why they’re disingenuous. But I’ve been seeing a somewhat different set of arguments from the left — not so much a complaint about the sums being sent to Ukraine as the claim that we have a huge, bloated military budget, and perhaps that “merchants of death” are driving our support both for Ukraine and for Israel.

What people making such claims should know is that their views about how much we spend on the military are generations out of date.

It’s true that Dwight Eisenhower gave a speech warning about the dangers of the “military-industrial complex.” But he gave that speech in 1961 — that is, his warning was as far in our past as, say, the Spanish-American War was in his.

746,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/10/27/technology/twitter-x-elon-musk-anniversary.html,"When Elon Musk bought Twitter a year ago, he said he wanted to create what he called a “common digital town square.” “That said,” he wrote, “Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape.” A year later, according to study after study, Mr. Musk’s platform has become exactly that.

The Consequences of Elon Musk’s Ownership of X

Now rebranded as X, the site has experienced a surge in racist, antisemitic and other hateful speech. Under Mr. Musk’s watch, millions of people have been exposed to misinformation about climate change. Foreign governments and operatives — from Russia to China to Hamas — have spread divisive propaganda with little or no interference.

Mr. Musk and his team have repeatedly asserted that such concerns are overblown, sometimes pushing back aggressively against people who voice them. Yet dozens of studies from multiple organizations have shown otherwise, demonstrating on issue after issue a similar trend: an increase in harmful content on X during Mr. Musk’s tenure.

The war between Israel and Hamas — the sort of major news event that once made Twitter an essential source of information and debate — has drowned all social media platforms in false and misleading information, but for Mr. Musk’s platform in particular the war has been seen as a watershed. The conflict has captured in full how much the platform has descended into the kind of site that Mr. Musk had promised advertisers he wanted to avoid on the day he officially took over.

“With disinformation about the Israel-Hamas conflict flourishing so dramatically on X, it feels that it crossed a line for a lot of people where they can see — beyond just the branding change — that the old Twitter is truly gone,” Tim Chambers of Dewey Square Group, a public affairs company that tracks social media, said in an interview. “And the new X is a shadow of that former self.”

The growing sense of chaos on the platform has already hurt Mr. Musk’s investment. While it remains one of the most popular social media services, people visited the website nearly 5.9 billion times in September, down 14 percent from the same month last year, according to the data analysis firm Similarweb.

Advertisers have also fled, leading to a sizable slump in sales. Mr. Musk noted this summer that ad revenue had fallen 50 percent. He blamed the Anti-Defamation League, one of several advocacy groups that have cataloged the rise of hateful speech on X, for “trying to kill this platform.”

Most of the problems, however, stem from changes that Mr. Musk instituted – some intentionally, some not. Studies about the state of X have been conducted over the past year by researchers and analysts at universities, think tanks and advocacy organizations concerned with the spread of hate speech and other harmful content.

Research conducted in part by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue concluded that anti-Semitic tweets in English more than doubled after Mr. Musk’s takeover. A report from the European Commission found that engagement with pro-Kremlin accounts grew 36 percent on the platform in the first half of this year after Mr. Musk lifted mitigation measures.

Mr. Musk disbanded an advisory council focused on trust and safety issues and laid off scores of employees who addressed them. For a monthly fee, he offered users a blue checkmark, a label that once conveyed that Twitter had verified the identity of the user behind an account. He then used algorithms to promote accounts of uncertain provenance in users’ feeds. He removed labels that identified government and state media accounts for countries like Russia and China that censor independent media.

“The entire year’s worth of changes to X were fully stress tested during the global news breaking last week,” Mr. Chambers said, referring to the conflict in Israel. “And in the eyes of many, myself included, it failed utterly.”

The company did not respond to a request for comment beyond a stock response it regularly uses to press inquiries: “Busy now, please check back later.”

X trails only Facebook’s 16.3 billion monthly visits and Instagram’s 6.4 billion visits, according to Similarweb. TikTok, which is rising in popularity among certain demographic groups, has roughly two billion visits each month. Despite voluble threats by disgruntled users to move to alternative platforms – Mastodon, BlueSky or Meta’s new rival to Mr. Musk’s, Threads – none of them have yet reached the critical mass to replicate the public exposure that X offers.

Keeping X at the center of public debate is exactly Mr. Musk’s goal, which he describes at times with a messianic zeal. The day after Hamas attacked Israel, Mr. Musk urged his followers to follow “the war in real time.”

He then cited two accounts that are notorious for spreading disinformation, including a false post in the spring that an explosion had occurred outside the Pentagon. Faced with a flurry of criticism, Mr. Musk deleted the post and later sounded chastened.

He urged his followers on X to “stay as close to the truth as possible, even for stuff you don’t like. This platform aspires to maximize signal/noise of the human collective.”

Mr. Musk, the prominent, outspoken executive behind Tesla and Space X, had been an avid Twitter user for years before taking it over, promoting his ventures and himself, at times with crude, offensive comments. During the Covid-19 pandemic, he sharply criticized lockdowns and other measures to slow the virus’s spread and began to warn of a “woke” culture that silenced dissent.

Among his first acts as the site’s owner was to reverse the bans on thousands of accounts, including those of users who had promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory and spread disinformation about Covid and the 2020 presidential election.

The impact was instantaneous. Researchers at Tufts, Rutgers and Montclair State universities documented spikes in the use of racial and ethnic slurs soon after Mr. Musk’s acquisition. One research institute found that a campaign on 4chan, a notorious bulletin board, encouraged the use of a particular slur within hours of his arrival, in what seemed to be a coordinated test of the new owner’s tolerance for offensive speech.

The prevalence of such offensive language has, according to numerous studies, continued unabated. “The Musk acquisition saw a sustained rise in hateful speech on the platform,” an article in The Misinformation Review, a peer-reviewed journal published by the Harvard Kennedy School, said in August.

Even worse, the article argued, Mr. Musk’s changes appear to be boosting the engagements of the most contentious users.

A month into Mr. Musk’s ownership, the platform stopped enforcing its policy against Covid-19 misinformation. The liberal watchdog group Media Matters later identified 250 accounts with high engagement on Covid-related tweets. Nine of the top 10 accounts were known anti-vaccine proponents, several of whom promoted unproven and potentially harmful treatments and attacked top public health officials.

Mr. Musk’s first summer as X’s boss also coincided with a rash of climate-related disasters around the world, including deadly heat waves, rampaging wildfires, torrential rains and intense flooding. Last month, a scorecard evaluating social media companies on their defenses against climate-related falsehoods awarded X a single point out of a possible 21 (Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, was given eight points).

The platform was “lacking clear policies that address climate misinformation, having no substantive public transparency mechanisms, and offering no evidence of effective policy enforcement,” said the accompanying report from Climate Action Against Disinformation, an international coalition of more than 50 environmental advocacy groups.

This year, hundreds of researchers pushed back against a decision by X to end free access to software that would allow them collect and analyze data about the site.

Perhaps the most impactful change under Mr. Musk has been the evolution of his subscription plans. The blue checkmark that once conveyed veracity and denoted verified accounts, often those of government agencies, companies and prominent users, was now available to any account for $8 a month.

In April, Mr. Musk began removing the blue badges from verified accounts. New ones impersonating public officials, government agencies and celebrities proliferated, causing confusion about which were real. The platform went on to reward those who paid for their blue labels by amplifying their posts over those without the badge.

Reset, a nonprofit research organization, discovered that dozens of anonymous accounts linked to the Kremlin received the checkmark, pushing Russian narratives on the war in Ukraine. This spring, the platform also removed the labels that identified official state media of countries like Russia, China and Iran. In the 90 days after the change, engagement with posts from the English-language accounts of those outlets soared 70 percent, NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, reported in September.

Mr. Musk has now run afoul of the European Union’s newly enacted Digital Services Act, a law that requires social media platforms to restrict misinformation and other violative content within the union’s 27 nations.

A report commissioned by the union’s executive body warned in August that Mr. Musk’s dismantling of guardrails on the platform had resulted in a 36 percent increase in engagement with Kremlin-linked accounts from January through May, mostly pushing Russia’s justifications for its illegal invasion of Ukraine last year.

After war erupted between Israel and Hamas, Thierry Breton, a European Commissioner who oversees the law’s implementation, warned Mr. Musk in a letter that was posted on X, saying the company needed to address “violent and terrorist content that appears to circulate on your platform.”

Reset, the research organization, reported recently that it had documented 166 posts that its researchers considered antisemitic. Many appeared to violate laws in several European countries, including calls for violence against Jews and denying the historical facts of the Holocaust. They accumulated at least 23 million views and 480,000 engagements.

Mr. Musk sounded incredulous, even as the company scrambled to delete accounts linked to Hamas and other terrorist groups. He responded two days later to an account identified by the Anti-Defamation League as one of the most prominent purveyors of disinformation. The account, which had been removed from Twitter but was restored last December after Mr. Musk took over, had claimed that the European Union was trying to police the truth.

“They still haven’t provided any examples of disinformation,” Mr. Musk replied."

Trump but refused to carry out Mr. Trump’s demand that he block the 2020 election results, ended his presidential bid on Saturday, with a final appeal for his party to return to conservative principles and resist the “siren song of populism.”

The surprise announcement came at the end of his remarks before a crowd of Jewish Republican donors in Las Vegas, and was met with gasps. Mr. Pence had received a standing ovation, opening his speech with a full-throated endorsement of Israel’s military operations in Gaza.

Then he pivoted to a more “personal note,” saying that after much prayer and deliberation, he had decided to drop out of the race.

First, you call off a performance by an irreverent rock band. Then you dial down the celebrity wattage. And then you serve up some root vegetables and ice cream.

But, not a joke, you don’t cancel. The party goes on because if the president cancels an event every time there is an emergency or a conflict overseas or Republicans render Congress nonfunctional, he would never leave the White House. And this state dinner, held in honor of Anthony Albanese, the Australian prime minister, was an opportunity to express a show of nuclear-powered military force to a planet that feels that it is about to spiral away from its axis.

Microsoft is poised to close its $69 billion takeover of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard, after British regulators signed off on the transaction on Friday.

The news gives the tech giant a win that at times had seemed unlikely, given the fierce opposition from regulators in the U.S. and Europe in the past two years. It also raises questions about the effectiveness of a campaign by antitrust enforcers to crack down on big-ticket takeovers.

Microsoft overcame major hurdles to seal its biggest-ever takeover, which is meant to add blockbuster titles like “Call of Duty” to its stable of video game titles. The transaction faced tough scrutiny — in particular from the F.T.C., which under Lina Khan has adopted a more aggressive stance on major deals.

The F.T.C. sued to block the transaction last year, testing novel legal arguments about how much the deal would amplify Microsoft’s dominance in video games, since the two companies aren’t considered direct competitors. In April, Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority opposed the acquisition as well — dealing Microsoft a serious and unexpected blow in that overturning the agency’s ruling would require clearing a high legal bar."

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING

Wall Street awaits a report on consumer prices. The Commerce Department will shortly release the Consumer Price Index data for September. Economists expect that “core” C.P.I., which strips out food and fuel, rose by 4.1 percent on an annual basis, the smallest increase in two years. High numbers could stoke concerns that the Fed will raise interest rates to tamp down inflation, though many investors are betting it won’t.

Jes Staley, Barclays’s former C.E.O., is banned from Britain’s financial industry. The punishment by the country’s Financial Conduct Authority, which also includes a fine of £1.5 million ($1.8 million), was for misleading the regulator and the bank over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Though Staley publicly played down his ties to the disgraced financier and sex offender, he privately described Epstein as one of his “most cherished” friends.

Goldman Sachs sues Malaysia over a 1MDB settlement. The Wall Street giant sought to take the country’s government to arbitration amid efforts by Malaysian leaders to alter the agreement, which ended an investigation into the bank’s role in a sprawling foreign bribery case. Separately, Goldman sold its GreenSky lending unit at a loss as it seeks to pare down its consumer-finance operations."
751,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/business/treasury-report-shows-1-7-trillion-deficit.html,"America’s federal budget deficit effectively doubled in the 2023 fiscal year as slumping tax receipts, rising interest rates and persistent demand for expiring pandemic relief benefits strained the nation’s finances.

The latest Treasury Department figures showed a budget deficit of $1.7 trillion in 2023, up from $1.37 trillion in 2022. Those numbers make the deficit look smaller than it actually was last year, because of an accounting mirage related to a student-loan forgiveness program that President Biden proposed last year.

That program was struck down by the Supreme Court this summer and never took effect. But the Treasury recorded it as a cost in 2022, which inflated that year’s deficit. After the court killed the program, the Treasury recorded it as savings, which artificially reduced this year’s deficit.

Those student loan effects changed the deficit figures for both 2022 and 2023. When factoring them out, the deficit jumped to $2 trillion in 2023 from about $1 trillion in 2022, administration officials confirmed in a call with reporters on Friday."
752,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/briefing/investigating-kanye.html,"When Adidas ended its wildly lucrative shoe deal with Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, a year ago, the breakup appeared to be the culmination of weeks of his inflammatory remarks about Jews and Black Lives Matter. But our examination found that behind the scenes, the partnership was fraught from the start.

Interviews with current and former employees of Adidas and of West, along with hundreds of previously undisclosed internal records, including contracts, text messages and financial documents, provide the fullest accounting yet of the relationship. Here are seven takeaways.

For almost 10 years, Adidas looked past West’s misconduct as profits soared. The partnership, which began in 2013, boosted company profits and made West a billionaire. But West subjected employees to antisemitic and other abusive comments. And though their contract for years had a clause allowing Adidas to end the agreement if West’s behavior harmed the company’s reputation, it’s not clear that executives ever considered invoking it before terminating the deal last year.

West showed a troubling fixation on Jews and Hitler. At a 2013 meeting with Adidas designers at the company’s headquarters in Germany, he drew a swastika on one of their sketches. He later told a Jewish Adidas manager to kiss a portrait of Hitler every day. And West told Adidas colleagues that he admired Hitler’s command of propaganda."
753,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/us/politics/biden-jordan-house-speaker.html,"As much of a struggle as it was for Mr. Biden to work across party lines with Kevin McCarthy when he was speaker, a Jordan speakership would be a nightmare in the view of the president’s aides. Mr. Jordan, dubbed a “legislative terrorist” by former Speaker John A. Boehner, a fellow Republican, has long preferred bomb throwing to deal making and could push for Mr. Biden’s impeachment, government shutdowns and other moves at odds with the White House.

Mr. Biden has resolutely refused to comment at any length about the chaos in the House, sticking by the old view that it is up to Congress to determine its own leadership, not the executive branch. Still, he has alluded to his attitude before. When Mr. Jordan jumped into the speakership race a couple of weeks ago, Mr. Biden said he would work with whoever won. “Some people, I imagine, it could be easier to work with than others,” he said, “but whoever the speaker is, I’ll try to work with.”

His aides have likewise refused to be drawn into the Republican civil war. “They have the majority in the House,” Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Air Force One on the way to Israel on Tuesday. “It is for them to fix. They have to select who the speaker is going to be.”

In their more sober moments, White House aides privately lament the disarray in the House because it makes it that much harder to get anything done and certainly does not augur well for the health of American democracy.

In their more partisan moments, they privately savor the spectacle that they believe their adversaries brought on themselves and richly deserve. And in their campaign mind-set, they hope that voters in next year’s elections remember the contrast between the president as a globe-trotting statesman and House Republicans as an out-of-control kindergarten class."
754,https://www.nytimes.com/article/house-speaker-whats-next.html,"Follow our live updates for the House speaker nominee vote.

The position of speaker of the House has been vacant since early October amid Republican feuding that has left the chamber paralyzed.

House Republicans have elected two nominees for the job since a hard-right clutch of lawmakers toppled Speaker Kevin McCarthy. But both men — Representatives Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 Republican, and Jim Jordan of Ohio — were forced to withdraw their candidacies after it became clear that neither could muster the 217 votes needed to win the position.

House Republicans cast aside Mr. Jordan as their nominee for speaker on Friday in a secret-ballot vote, essentially moving to begin the search for a new leader all over again. In the days since, a flood of lawmakers have thrown their hats in the ring for the top leadership post.

Here’s a look at what comes next:

House Republicans met on Monday to hold a candidate forum for aspiring speaker nominees to present their visions for the conference."

756,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/us/politics/patrick-mchenry-house-speaker.html,"The second failed effort on Wednesday by Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio to be elected House speaker added momentum to an idea that has been floated by lawmakers in both parties in recent days: Give Representative Patrick T. McHenry, the interim speaker, explicit power to conduct legislative business.

Mr. McHenry is acting as temporary speaker under rules adopted after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that require the speaker of the House to come up with a list of people to fill the post in the event that it becomes vacant. When former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was booted out by a right-wing rebellion two weeks ago, the world learned that Mr. McHenry’s was the first name on his list.

Many House aides believe that Mr. McHenry’s power is strictly confined to presiding over the election of a new speaker, as he has been doing this week. But because this situation hasn’t come up before, some congressional scholars argue that the bounds of the acting speaker’s power are largely dependent on what a majority of members is willing to tolerate.

And as the turmoil around replacing Mr. McCarthy has continued, some members in both parties have been quietly discussing a way to explicitly grant Mr. McHenry permission to step in with full — or at least expanded — authority to run the House."
757,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/briefing/house-speaker.html,"In the past three weeks, House Republicans have dumped their party leader — Speaker Kevin McCarthy — and repeatedly failed to elect the candidate whom they had nominated to replace McCarthy.

They can’t seem to find anyone who can win the 217 votes needed for a House majority. There are currently 221 Republicans in the House, and at least a handful has opposed every candidate so far. The result is a political mess with little precedent in the U.S. Congress.

Yesterday afternoon, Republicans nominated Tom Emmer, a relative moderate from Minnesota, to be the next speaker, choosing him from a field of seven candidates. But Emmer dropped out of the race hours later, an acknowledgment that he too lacked the votes to become speaker. Too many right-wing members objected to him, and Donald Trump attacked him on social media as “totally out-of-touch with Republican Voters.”

Last night, Republicans chose yet another nominee: Mike Johnson of Louisiana, a hard-line conservative. Johnson will now try to win enough support to become speaker. He is Republicans’ fourth nominee in recent weeks, after Jim Jordan, Steve Scalise and Emmer."

It was strikingly similar to a fictional scene that Mr. Trump acted out earlier this month, pretending to be Mr. Biden mistaking Iowa for Idaho and needing an aide to straighten him out.

In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has also told supporters not to vote, and claimed to have defeated President Barack Obama in an election. He has praised the collective intellect of an Iranian-backed militant group that has long been an enemy of both Israel and the United States, and repeatedly mispronounced the name of the armed group that rules Gaza.

“This is a different Donald Trump than 2015 and ’16 — lost the zip on his fastball,” Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida told reporters last week while campaigning in New Hampshire.

The elevation of Mr. Johnson, 51, an architect of the effort to overturn the 2020 election and a religious conservative opposed to abortion rights, homosexuality and gay marriage, further cemented the Republican Party’s lurch to the right. It came after a historic fight that began when the hard right ousted Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Oct. 3, and raged on as the divided House G.O.P. nominated and then quickly discarded three other candidates to succeed him.

Exhausted from the feuding, which unleashed a barrage of recriminations and violent threats against lawmakers, both the right wing and mainstream Republicans finally united to elect Mr. Johnson, 51, in a 220-to-209 vote.

The vote put him second in line to the presidency, capping an extraordinary period of twists and turns on Capitol Hill. It marked a victory for the far right that has become a dominant force in the Republican Party, which rose up this month to effectively dictate the removal of an establishment speaker and the installation of an arch-conservative replacement."

That might be an understatement.

In the House, Republicans are casting about for a new leader, mired in an internecine battle marked by screaming, cursing and a fresh flood of candidates. In the Senate, their party is led by Senator Mitch McConnell, who spent weeks arguing that he remained physically and mentally fit enough for the position after freezing midsentence in two public appearances. And on the 2024 campaign trail, the dominant front-runner, Donald J. Trump, faces 91 felony charges across four cases, creating a drumbeat of legal news that often overwhelms any of his party’s political messages.

To oil analysts and investors, Chevron’s $53 billion takeover of Hess confirmed that there’s a new cycle of consolidation in the industry, coming less than two weeks after Exxon Mobil’s $59.5 billion bid for Pioneer Natural Resources.

Even as fossil-fuel producers face pressure from climate-minded policymakers, investors and activists to embrace greener energy — more on that below — they’re instead focusing on getting bigger. That could create a larger gap in the industry between those who have the firepower and freedom to buy rivals, and those who, because of politics or finances, do not.

Chevron and Exxon are acting from a position of strength, striking deals while they sit on billions in cash because of rising oil prices. That’s also reflected in their share prices, which have been climbing, making it attractive to use as deal currency.

Being able to offer stock helped persuade their targets — whose shares have also been rising — to sell. “We’re not only locking in and preserving the value we’ve created over the last several years but we still participate in the upside that you’re talking about,” John Hess, the C.E.O. of Hess, told investors on Monday."

It’s either him or us.”

Brown was sitting in the lobby of the Manhattan shelter run by Animal Care Centers of NYC, where she had come, sadly, to give up Chiip.

Nearly 5,000 animals were surrendered to Animal Care Centers — which has a city contract to run New York City’s public animal shelters — through September of this year. The number of adoptions hasn’t kept up with the deluge of animals being surrendered or brought in as strays, said Katy Hansen, the organization’s director of marketing and communications, and many animals have been waiting weeks or months without being adopted.

The dog population has become so enormous that for the first time, Animal Care Centers recently announced it had run out of space and was “closed for dog surrenders.” In July, the organization made a similar announcement about cats.

As it turns out, the organization couldn’t really refuse to take more animals. Hundreds of dogs have been accepted in recent weeks because the organization’s contract with the city requires it to take any animals brought in, Hansen said."
766,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/opinion/columnists/us-power-republican-party.html,"That said, even serious students of international affairs are noting that the world seems to be becoming more dangerous, with many local cold wars turning hot, and suggesting that we may be witnessing the end of the Pax Americana, the long era in which U.S. economic and military dominance limited the potential for wars of conquest.

But why is the Pax Americana in decline?

You might be tempted to engage in economic determinism, saying that the United States has lost influence because it doesn’t dominate the world economy the way it once did. But while there was a big decline in America’s share of world G.D.P. between 1960 and 1980, since then that share hasn’t had a clear downward trend, although it has fluctuated with the foreign exchange value of the dollar.

Indeed, our strong recovery from the Covid recession, combined with the stumbles of some geopolitical rivals, makes U.S. economic dominance look more durable than it has for a long time. Notably, many observers are now suggesting that China’s G.D.P., measured in dollars, may never overtake America’s. (China’s economy is already larger in terms of domestic purchasing power, but this is less relevant for global influence.)

Oh, and despite all the hype about de-dollarization, the U.S. dollar seems, if anything, to be more central to the world economy than ever.

Furthermore, changes in the world economy have arguably given the United States new ways to exercise economic power. The international relations experts Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman recently published “Underground Empire: How America Weaponized the World Economy,” a revelatory book that describes how modern globalization — which creates far more complex forms of interdependence than traditional international trade — has put America “at the heart of an international web of surveillance and control.”"

Trump’s leading rivals continue to engage in a pitched battle with one another as much as with him, igniting fears that internal divisions were threatening to doom efforts to find a fresh face for the Republican Party in 2024.

From Dallas to Park City, Utah, top Republican donors gathered behind closed doors this week as talk intensified about the need to cull the G.O.P. field. In private remarks to donors in Utah, Nikki Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations, delivered a blunt message that it was time to pick sides and invest if there was any chance to prevent another Trump nomination.

“Get in the game,” Ms. Haley urged them, according to two people who were present at the event.

But given Mr. Trump’s durable lead, some political financiers are considering staying on the sidelines. For those donors who aren’t, the choice has increasingly narrowed to Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Ms. Haley, whose fortunes have been lifted by her performance in the first two debates. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina is a factor as well, given the $25 million his super PAC has remaining in television ad reservations in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina in the next three months.

On Friday, teams of advisers to Mr. DeSantis, Ms. Haley and Mr. Scott descended on Dallas for separate presentations to an exclusive gathering of some of the most influential Republican donors in the nation, a group known as the American Opportunity Alliance. They met at a property owned by the billionaire Republican financier Harlan Crow, who has gained attention and scrutiny for his close relationship with Justice Clarence Thomas."
768,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/us/politics/mike-johnson-interview-hannity-takeaways.html,"Speaker Mike Johnson said on Thursday evening that his personal worldview and policy positions are dictated by the Bible, in his first extended interview since assuming the job second in line to the presidency.

During a 41-minute interview with the Fox News host Sean Hannity, Mr. Johnson, a 51-year-old Louisiana Republican, acknowledged that some of his conservative Christian views, such as his opposition to same-sex marriage, run counter to the law. He said he would not try to impose that view or others, such as his opposition to abortion, on the whole country. He also laid out how he planned to approach other major issues that would soon come before Congress.

While Mr. Johnson played a pivotal role in former President Donald J. Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, Mr. Hannity did not ask him a single question about it in the lengthy broadcast. Mr. Hannity famously told Mr. Trump to stop talking about the 2020 election.

Here are nine takeaways from the interview.

1. Johnson’s views stem from the Bible.

“I am a Bible-believing Christian,” he told Mr. Hannity. “Someone asked me today in the media, they said, ‘It’s curious, people are curious. What does Mike Johnson think about any issue under the sun?’ I said, ‘Well, go pick up a Bible off your shelf and read it.’ That’s my worldview.”"

They gave Egyptian officials internal information about staffing at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. And they pushed the U.S. secretary of state to help block a dam project on the Nile River that Egypt’s government vigorously opposed.

In return, prosecutors say, the Menendezes received hundreds of thousands of dollars in gold bars, cash and other bribes.

The fact that the couple was talking directly to General Helmy and his boss, Gen. Abbas Kamel, the chief of Egypt’s powerful General Intelligence Service, is a measure of how important Mr. Menendez was to the highest levels of the Egyptian government and how central the country’s spies have become to its interests.

Neither General Helmy nor General Kamel are named in the indictments, and their roles have not been previously reported. General Helmy is identified in the indictment only as “Egyptian Official-3” and General Kamel as “Egyptian Official-5.” But three U.S. officials have confirmed their names.

The roles of the two Egyptian spies in trying to influence U.S. policy also provide more evidence to suggest that the information-passing and bribe-paying could be part of an espionage operation centered on Mr. Menendez, and not just another tactic to wield influence in Washington."

As a pianist, Graffman was a child prodigy who had made his New York recital debut at age 10. As a young man, he played Tchaikovsky at the Hollywood Bowl and survived a tour that took him — “by some freakishly alliterative coincidence,” as he once put it — from Baden-Baden (in Germany) to Bora-Bora (in the Leeward Islands). “Short, pleasant, comfortably stooped and bespectacled, he lacks the craggy grandeur of a Rubinstein or even the gawky magnetism of Cliburn,” the critic John Rockwell wrote in The New York Times when Graffman was 44. “All he does is play the piano very well.”

But his performing career was interrupted in the 1970s when his right hand was impaired by a neurological disorder. He went on to play pieces written for the left hand. He published a memoir, “I Really Should Be Practicing,” when he was 53. From when he was 58 to when he was 78, he was the artistic director or president of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where his students included stars like Lang Lang and Yuja Wang.

Apparently he taught them about more than playing the piano, I wrote several years ago after spending an afternoon sampling his vodka infusions. He mentioned one former student who would stop by from time to time. “The door opens,” he said. “She doesn’t say, ‘I haven’t seen you for a while.’ She says, ‘Tangerine.’”

He did not name the tangerine enthusiast then, but when I called him this week to talk about the party and repeated that anecdote, he said, “That was Yuja.”"

As battles raged across the country, he tracked them on the app, staying up through many nights in a hotel room in Tbilisi, Georgia, to read updates as they rolled in, one tweet at a time.

“As more Ukrainians hopped onto Twitter to tell their story, you had a lot of good accounts from them,” Mr. Campiz said.

When war broke out this month in Israel and Gaza, Mr. Campiz, 40, a cartographer who now lives in Florida, turned to Twitter again. But his timeline on the app, which has been renamed X, was filled with posts from accounts he didn’t recognize and content that had been debunked, he said.

With the war in Ukraine, “Twitter was invaluable because you were able to get connected to accounts that were providing good information,” he said. “I feel really helpless in this Israel-Gaza thing because on Twitter now, the ability to do that is just gone.”"

Gavin Newsom to sign or veto the roughly 900 bills that the State Legislature sent him before its session ended last month. He’s already torn through hundreds of measures this week, and as of Thursday evening, about 100 were still awaiting his decision.

Newsom approved dozens of bills aimed at making housing more affordable in California, including one that would limit renters’ security deposits to no more than one month’s rent. Under the old rules, established in 1977, landlords in the state could insist on as much as three months’ rent as a deposit.

The governor also signed several measures that, in classic California fashion, will be first-in-the-nation programs or efforts. One law makes California the first state to ban the citation of “excited delirium” as a cause of death; prominent medical associations say the term refers to a dubious concept rooted in racism that is often used to justify the deaths of people in police custody.

He approved a law creating the country’s “Ebony Alert” system, a special notification system intended specifically to help find missing Black children and women. Advocates say such cases often do not receive the same attention and police resources as those of missing white people."

Australia is fast heading into our worst fire season since the summer of 2019-2020, or Black Summer, when nearly 500 people died, either through direct deaths or smoke inhalation. All-too-familiar images of horrific blazes and blood-red skies are already starting to fill the news. This week, dozens of homes were destroyed and hundreds of people have been evacuated as firefighters battle a wildfire in the Tara region in Queensland. Two people died in two separate fires in New South Wales earlier this month, one of them a firefighter who suffered a medical emergency while on the job.

We are better prepared this year, officials have said. More firefighting aircraft are available, and our national emergency coordination has been streamlined. And experts broadly do not expect this summer to be as bad as four years ago as it is being preceded by several years of rain and floods rather than drought.

Still, it’s an unsettling feeling, watching the news and waiting for the worst.

In the heart of Sydney, far away from any landscapes that could burn, I’ve been looking into getting an air purifier for my parents, who have respiratory problems. I’ve overheard conversations from residents contemplating leaving the country for a month or two, fearing another summer of smoke and smog.

Of course, that’s something that many residents in bushfire-prone areas don’t have the luxury of considering. Many are still rebuilding their lives and homes after Black Summer, have spent the past four years trying to fireproof their communities, and have become de facto experts in fire-related topics as diverse as vegetation and weather maps. And for some, danger and destruction have already arrived."

Mere minutes after a slim majority of Republicans voted in a closed-door party meeting to select him as the party’s candidate, Mr. Scalise’s fate was thrown into doubt. Several Republican lawmakers announced they would not back him on the House floor without concessions, complaining of a rushed process to choose a new speaker and voicing skepticism that he could unite their fractious conference.

Republicans delayed an election of the full House that had been planned for midafternoon while the party regrouped, and adjourned on Wednesday evening with no resolution. They scheduled another meeting of the House for noon on Thursday, but there was no sign that the G.O.P. was any closer to an agreement that would allow them to elect a speaker at that point."

But there was no sign on Thursday that Republicans were ready to end their bickering despite the press of world events and it was unclear how they could right the ship after Mr. Scalise’s wrenching decision.

After a historic vote to remove their own speaker last week, they appeared on the verge of a quick recovery on Wednesday when G.O.P. lawmakers met and voted narrowly to nominate Mr. Scalise, the No. 2 Republican, to succeed former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. But it quickly became clear that Republicans were not willing to put aside their divisions and support him on the House floor. In quitting the fight on Thursday night, Mr. Scalise said some of his colleagues had “their own agendas.” Some were dug in for Representative Jim Jordan, the hard-right Ohio Republican who co-founded the House Freedom Caucus and challenged Mr. Scalise for the nomination, falling just 14 votes short.

Others simply refused to commit.

Trying to stem the momentum against him, Mr. Scalise on Thursday had summoned his colleagues for yet another private meeting that stretched long into the afternoon in what one Republican described as an airing of slights big and small worthy of Festivus, a parody holiday. Lawmakers warned they were hurting not only their own image, but the nation’s as well.

“It sends a terrible signal,” said Representative Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican and former Air Force general whose swing district seat could be at risk if his party is deemed by voters to be incapable of governing. “We’re not a governing body and we should be.”

The concern overseas about what is transpiring as Israel engages with Hamas and Ukraine with Russia is real. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, in Europe during a Senate recess for meetings with high-level officials, said he faced persistent questions about the U.S. commitment in those regions and the instability in the House."

But first he had to shake the glitter off his suit jacket.

As Mr. Starmer took the stage at his party’s annual conference in Liverpool, he was interrupted by a protester who rushed up behind him and showered him with green and blue glitter. It took a full seven seconds for security guards to run onstage and tackle the man, who shouted, “Politics needs an update!”

Taken aback but not thrown off his stride, Mr. Starmer shed his jacket, rolled up his shirt sleeves, and tried to turn the spectacle into an object lesson about the transformed party he now led.

“Protest or power,” he said, referring to Labour’s lengthy stint in opposition. “That’s why we changed our party.”"

China has since disbursed close to $1 trillion to mostly developing countries, largely in loans, to build power plants, roads, airports, telecommunications networks and other infrastructure. Mr. Xi has used China’s cash and infrastructure expertise to tie together countries across Asia, Africa, Latin America and parts of Eastern and Southern Europe.

Belt and Road has established for China a role in global development rivaling that of the United States and the World Bank. But for all the influence it has brought Beijing, the initiative has contributed to unaffordable levels of debt for dozens of poor countries. China also directed contracts to its own companies and in some cases built expensive, subpar projects that have not spurred economic growth."

Years of noodling at home with a four-track culminated in his release of three singles on Spotify, under the moniker Ablinken. (Say that out loud slowly for dad-joke effect.)

The Spotify songs, which have collectively been streamed about 150,000 times — watch out, Harry Styles — show off a blues-rock sound with Everyman lyrics that bear no relation to the government official who talks about multilateral engagement and “diplomatic variable geometry.” (“And then I came home to you/But you said, ‘Let’s just be friends, yeah’” he sings over staccato electric chords in “Lip Service.”)

Mr. Blinken noted that he had recorded and uploaded the songs between 2018 and 2020, during the Trump era, when he was out of government and unsure whether he would return. “I had little idea that there would be another run at government, or a public career of any kind,” he said. “And so when the president put me forward for this job, there they were.”

The songs, which he has labeled “wonk rock,” occasionally pop up in his official life. They have been blared from speakers at overseas events, including before he addressed embassy employees in San José, the capital of Costa Rica, in June 2021. A Finnish radio station broadcast one when Mr. Blinken visited Helsinki in June to deliver a speech about the war in Ukraine.

Mr. Blinken’s former band, which has played under the name of Cash Bar Wedding, was pretty cool, at least by the standards of Washington.

France has been under its highest terrorist threat level since Friday, when the teacher, Dominique Bernard, was killed at a school in Arras, in northern France. A suspect was quickly arrested at the scene: Officials said he was a former student of Mr. Bernard’s, and had already been under surveillance as a potential Islamist extremist.

On Saturday morning, the Louvre, the world’s most visited art museum, ushered visitors out and closed its doors in response to “a written message that there was a risk,” said Coralie James, a spokeswoman for the museum. “In the current national context,” she added, the museum had decided to shut for the day, “while we carry out the necessary checks.”

782,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/magazine/open-relationship-wife-ethics.html,"My wife became pregnant soon after we met, when our relationship was “fluid” and non-monogamous. We agreed to raise the child together and, at my urging, to have an open relationship. However, our relationship since has been monogamous. My wife was injured during the birth of our second child and now finds sex painful and avoids it. (We had a terrific sex life before the injury.) When I broached the topic of having other partners and reminded her of our agreement to have an open relationship, she became irritated and said that having kids changed things. Subsequent discussions resulted in a stalemate.

I very much enjoy my wife’s company and love her and our two kids. I have no intention of separating from my family. Nonetheless, I harbor resentments that my wife reneged on her commitment to me, and this, together with the lack of sex, is creating a wedge between us. Would it be ethical to take a mistress, given her earlier promise, and if so, can I do this discreetly so as to avoid tension and perhaps divorce? Or should I tell her I am planning to pursue this course of action? Or does the inherent risk of infidelity mean I should accept near-celibacy indefinitely? — Name Withheld

From the Ethicist:

I do understand your quandary, but you’re undermining the needed conversation by insisting that its outcome has already been settled. You say your wife reneged on her commitment to you. Did she really? The arrangement that you urged, and that she acquiesced to, never materialized. If a relationship becomes de facto monogamous, it’s reasonable to think that a long-ago agreement — dating back to a time when a relationship that has since coalesced was still “fluid” — has been made moot. The rules of a non-monogamous relationship need to be very clear if it isn’t going to be undermined by outside activities. Ethical non-monogamy requires open channels of communication and consent that’s more than resigned submission.

Proceeding, openly or otherwise, on the basis of an agreement she has repudiated would be disrespectful. Discretion doesn’t guarantee that your wife won’t discover what you’re doing, which could result in extensive damage to trust and intimacy. And especially if your liaisons are on the down-low, you may end up with an emotional investment in an outside relationship that diminishes or competes with your marital relationship. That’s a problem if your aim is to keep your marriage together and to preserve a nurturing family for your children."
783,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/02/books/review/martin-peretz-controversialist.html,"I find myself slipping into the past tense. Peretz is, circa right now, at least 64 percent canceled. The official end came in 2010, when he was blogging (“a mistake,” he writes). He made several expedient comments, in the context of a larger argument, including that Muslims may not be worthy of First Amendment protections and that “Muslim life is cheap.” The indignation did not let up for a long time. He writes about the aftermath:

The invasion of Iraq, which I backed, is a disaster; the financial system that my friends helped build has crashed; my wife and I are divorced; The New Republic is sold after I feared going bust — and here I am in my white suit walking across Harvard Yard, surrounded by students: “Harvard, Harvard, shame on you, honoring a racist fool.” The racist fool is, apparently, me. It’s a sodden coda, one I don’t quite grasp, or believe.

More was to come. His iteration of The New Republic did not fare well, in the rearview mirror, under the inquisitive searchlights of #MeToo and Black Lives Matter. The magazine’s longtime literary editor, the lion-maned Leon Wieseltier, who left in 2014, was accused three years later of sexual harassment during his time at The New Republic. The magazine’s decision to publish an excerpt from Charles Murray’s third-rail-gripping 1994 book “The Bell Curve,” in part about racial differences in I.Q., continues to elicit reproof. Add to this the fabrications and plagiarism of the writers Stephen Glass and Ruth Shalit, and The New Republic of the Peretz era can in retrospect begin to resemble, to many, a leaky, disreputable ghost barge.

Peretz is sorry about some of these things. He quickly apologized, he notes here, for his “wild and wounding” language about Muslims. He regrets “not recognizing the plight of the Black underclass in the pages of The New Republic.” He regrets (“regret is not a big enough word”) supporting the invasion of Iraq. But he defends the decision to publish Murray (“Murray is a person who matters”) alongside dissenting opinions, and he stands by Wieseltier, “an intellectual who is also a man of the senses.” He writes: “The truth is that Leon may have been disrespectful to women, but he has also respected them and their work.” He notes that Wieseltier’s new magazine, Liberties, publishes Martha Nussbaum, Helen Vendler and Louise Glück.

He’d much rather talk about his magazine’s high points, such as Andrew Sullivan’s landmark cover story making the conservative case for gay marriage in 1989. They also include publishing the reporting that led to Samantha Powers’s book “A Problem From Hell: America and the Age of Genocide,” which won a Pulitzer Prize in 2003.

He’s proud too, of gathering a group of some of the era’s liveliest thinkers, writers and editors, including Michael Kinsley, Hendrik Hertzberg and Charles Krauthammer. Kinsley was the reason I adored the magazine. He had a nearly Martian intelligence, and the dryness of his wit turned his opponents into pillars of salt. Office high jinks are recounted, such as the time Krauthammer had the password of a master hard drive permanently changed to “Kemp,” after the conservative congressman Jack Kemp, whom Hertzberg loathed.

The punch from Mailer arrived in Peretz’s solar plexus after The New Republic reviewed Mailer’s novel “The Gospel According to the Son” (1997), which reworked the life of Jesus Christ. It was a brutal review, by James Wood. The cover of the issue depicted Mailer on a cross, with the headline “He Is Finished.”"

His mounting frustration, voiced in interviews with reporters in the Capitol and on networks like CNN that are typically reviled on the right, is not merely an unusual display of bluntness.

Consumer prices overall rose 6.7 percent last month from a year earlier, the same pace as the previous month, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday. For the first time in four months, the cost of transportation added to the rate of inflation, because of an increase in gasoline and diesel prices.

Food prices fell on a monthly basis for the first time in two years, pushed lower by milk, cheese and soft drinks. But the easing in food inflation was driven only by “relatively small price movements,” the statistics office said."

The new Geffen Hall’s acoustics are clearer, if chillier than before. Because every detail in the orchestral playing is more easily audible, so too is every choice about balance — making the hall a tough proving ground for conductors. Guests can find themselves neatly sifted into one of two categories: those who intuitively grasp how to steer the Philharmonic in this space, and those who don’t.

Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla, who made her Philharmonic debut on Wednesday night, gets it.

This Lithuanian conductor led her first program at Geffen with assurance across varied styles — a feat that hasn’t been easily matched by some of her peers in the hall. Sometimes, modern or contemporary works can sound admirably chiseled, while 19th-century ones stint on warmth, and thus charm.

The evening, which the Philharmonic dedicated “to those impacted by the conflict and humanitarian crisis in Israel and the Gaza Strip,” included music from a living composer, Raminta Serksnytė’s “De Profundis”; a repertory war horse, Robert Schumann’s Piano Concerto; and a rarity from Sibelius, excerpts from the “Lemminkainen Suite.” But no era or style felt shortchanged on Wednesday.

Central Park is indeed a man-made place, designed so New Yorkers could escape the pressures of the city.

So did Rapinoe’s fiancée, Sue Bird, a retired star with the Seattle Storm in the W.N.B.A., who was sitting courtside at the Liberty’s game that afternoon.

Meg Linehan, who covers women’s soccer for The Athletic, told me that replacing Krieger would be difficult because she had meant so much to Gotham F.C. both as a player on the field and as a leader in the clubhouse.

794,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/30/us/politics/biden-military-aid-egypt.html,"Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, the new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, pledged on Saturday to block the release of $235 million in military aid to Egypt, a move that could force the Biden administration to reverse its decision to prioritize national security interests over Congress’s concerns about the country’s human rights record.

In a statement, Mr. Cardin also threatened to withhold future military aid for Egypt unless the country made demonstrable progress on releasing political prisoners, improving conditions for human rights activists and other issues.

“I believe it is imperative that we continue to hold the government of Egypt, and all governments, accountable for their human rights violations,” Mr. Cardin said. “I intend to exercise fully the committee’s oversight responsibilities and my authorities to block future foreign military funds as well as the sale of arms to the government of Egypt if it does not take concrete, meaningful and sustainable steps to improve the human rights conditions in this country.”

Mr. Cardin’s move comes just days after he took over the chairmanship of the foreign relations panel from Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, who was indicted last week on charges of taking bribes to facilitate sales of military equipment to Egypt and help an Egyptian American with close ties to the government in Cairo with his halal meat certification business."

Qatar’s foreign ministry said that a “successful family reunification process” had been completed this week in the case of the four, “marking an important step toward reuniting children with their families.” There was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian authorities.

The removal of children to Russia has been one of the most painful issues for Ukraine since Moscow launched its invasion last year; Ukraine’s government as well as parents and humanitarian groups have made strenuous efforts to get the children back.

The Ukrainian authorities have put the number of children deported at more than 16,000. In many cases, children in areas that Russian forces had seized were invited to go on holiday camps in the occupied region in southern Ukraine, near Crimea, or in Russia, and were then not returned. Sometimes parents were told that the children would be safer away from the fighting."

Ms. Woll was found with multiple stab wounds outside her home in the city’s Lafayette Park neighborhood, about a mile from the synagogue she had led since last year.

799,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/business/dealbook/is-crypto-financing-terrorism.html,"In 1980, there were 24 private equity firms, according to Prequin, which tracks alternative assets; by 2022, there were around 5,000 private equity firms controlling some 18,000 companies. Among the industries where private equity sank deep roots was health care. Private equity’s defenders, such the Healthcare Private Equity Association, say that its members are “building strong companies to positively impact health care,” but its critics say there is an irreconcilable conflict between building profits for investors and doing what is best for patients. The nursing home industry, they say, is one of the starkest examples.

Nursing homes cannot easily absorb the debt of a private-equity deal. The model depends on borrowing money to buy a company and then putting the debt on the balance sheet of the acquired company. With nursing homes, the firms often sell the underlying property to a real estate investment trust — forcing nursing homes to pay rent for facilities they had previously owned, while the cash from the sale goes to investors. Nursing homes do not have the ability to expand like a typical company, says Sabrina T. Howell, an economist at New York University who studies private equity, because they derive 70 and 90 percent of revenue from the federal government.

Thin margins have forced many nursing homes to shrink their nursing staff, leaving them ill prepared when the pandemic hit. Ms. Howell was a co-author of a study in 2019 that concluded that private-equity ownership can increase nursing home mortality by 11 percent. One New Jersey analysis found that facilities owned by private equity had a higher rate of Covid-19 deaths and cases than nursing homes not owned by private equity. In New Hampshire, by the end of 2020 one-fifth of all Covid deaths took place in three nursing homes owned by Genesis Healthcare, then controlled by Formation Capital, a private-equity firm narrowly focused on nursing homes.

Most economists who study this problem say the incentives are misaligned. Fewer than 20 percent of all nursing homes meet a recently proposed minimum staffing level, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation estimate. And Mark Parkinson, the chief executive of the American Health Care Association, which represents 14,000 nursing homes, described that proposal as “unfounded, unfunded and unrealistic.”

“Nursing homes are producing a good that we think has an important social function, which is why the government is essentially paying for it,” Ms. Howell said. “And the strategies that lead to maximizing profits are not the strategies that are necessarily in the best interest of taxpayers or the customers.”"

But while she was curious about all things American, the crush went unrequited. In Ms. Rabut’s mind, a Los Angeles native was supposed to have long, blond hair. Plus, she had a boyfriend.

Beyond being Facebook friends, they barely stayed in touch.

In the fall of 2017, after doing his bachelor’s degree in agricultural business at the California Polytechnic University of San Luis Obispo, Mr. Nastaskin returned to France for graduate school in the masters in international business program at the Grenoble Ecole de Management in France. With a job interview lined up in Paris in February 2018, he saw on Facebook that Ms. Rabut was studying for a doctoral degree in physics from the Sorbonne University in Paris. He suggested they meet.

Ms. Rabut thought they would have nothing in common, but agreed to lunch right near her physics lab, giving herself an out. She chose Do et Riz, a Vietnamese restaurant.

The Fed’s policy moves have been intended to slow demand in order to tamp down inflation. Price increases have been slowing down: Friday’s Personal Consumption Expenditures report also showed that overall inflation held steady at 3.4 percent in September.

That was in line with what economists had expected, and is down from a peak of 7.1 percent in the summer of 2022. And after stripping out volatile food and fuel for a clearer sense of the underlying inflation trend, a closely-watched core inflation measure eased slightly on an annual basis.

Still, Fed officials aim for 2 percent inflation, so the current pace is still much faster than their goal."
803,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/arts/music/laurie-anderson-sexmob-bam-review.html,"Laurie Anderson sounds like she’s ready to have fun again.

That much was clear after the first minute or so of her thrilling multimedia show on Tuesday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. This one-night-only, 100-minute set, titled “Let X = X,” featured new arrangements of several 1980s-era Anderson songs. It also featured a fun backing band in the jazz combo Sexmob, reliable purveyors of a good time.

Hasn’t Anderson earned a romping concert? So far in this century, she has kept her eye on grave matters. She mourned a changing, vulnerable New York City after Hurricane Sandy in “Landfall,” with the Kronos Quartet. She has likewise mourned the death of her longtime partner, Lou Reed, across multiple projects — including in her graceful, meditative film “Heart of a Dog.” And she detailed human rights violations in “Habeas Corpus,” a 2015 collaboration with a former Guantánamo prisoner, Mohammed el-Gharani, at the Park Avenue Armory.

I attended and admired all those. But I have never witnessed her really enjoying a groove — at least not in the same way that I’ve enjoyed on some of her first recordings, such as “Home of the Brave” or “United States Live.” On Tuesday, though, at the tail end of one spoken interlude that detailed a variety of her heroes — such as Gandhi and Philip Glass — she concluded by mentioning James Brown. When Anderson named the tune “Get on the Good Foot,” the Sexmob slide-trumpeter Steven Bernstein and the drummer Kenny Wollesen indulged her with a musical quotation. Then Anderson whooped a funk-accurate exultation and danced a bit in front of her array of electronics.

It wasn’t the only time she behaved like that. From the moment she strode onstage and triggered the synth samples of “From the Air,” she seemed to be enjoying herself, and reveled in the droll lyrics of that number: “Good evening. This is your captain. We are about to attempt a crash landing.”"
804,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/business/european-central-bank-rates-steady.html,"The European Central Bank held interest rates steady on Thursday for the first time in over a year as policymakers moved into their next phase of fighting inflation amid signs the region’s economy has weakened.

Officials have shifted their focus to how long they will need to maintain high interest rates in order to push inflation all the way down to the central bank’s target. The bank, which sets rates for the 20 countries that use the euro, kept the deposit rate at 4 percent, a record high.

“Inflation is still expected to stay too high for too long, and domestic price pressures remain strong,” Christine Lagarde, the president of the central bank, said at a news conference in Athens. “At the same time, inflation dropped markedly” last month and some measures of inflation, which would indicate persistence, have eased, she said.

The decision to hold interest rates was telegraphed last month when, after their 10th consecutive increase, policymakers signaled they might be done. The annual rate of inflation in the eurozone dropped to 4.3 percent in September, from a peak of 10.6 a year ago. But the rate isn’t forecast to return to the central bank’s 2 percent target until the third quarter of 2025, the central bank’s staff projected last month. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, slowed to 4.5 percent last month."
805,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/opinion/gen-z-millennials-republicans.html,"It is true, according to these researchers, that voters typically become more conservative as they get older, which is to say, as they gain income, buy property and start families. But the extent of that drift — of where it finally reaches — depends on where they start. When the Pew Research Center studied this question in 2013, for example, it found that the cohort of baby boomers who turned 18 under Richard Nixon was much more Democratic than the later cohort of boomers who turned 18 under Jimmy Carter.

Overall, according to the General Social Survey, boomers, who came of age during the turmoil and transformation of the 1960s and 1970s, are still more liberal than not. Gen Xers, who came of age during the Reagan revolution, started off more conservative than their older counterparts and have become the most consistently conservative generation in the electorate.

The case of millennial voters is where things start to get interesting. As children of Sept. 11, the war on terror and the 2008 financial crisis, millennials — born between 1981 and 1996 — entered the electorate much more Democratic than their immediate predecessors. But while they have gotten a little more conservative in the years since, it has been at a much slower rate than you’d expect.

What’s more, the gap in the number of millennials who identify as Democrats rather than Republicans is huge, with more than twice as many self-identified Democrats as Republicans. The next cohort on the roster, Gen Z, is even more liberal and Democratic than millennials and shows no indication of becoming substantially more conservative as it ages.

Now, we should always be a little wary of talking about “generations” as uniform, monolithic or even particularly coherent. But groups of Americans do share common experiences, and it is not hard to explain the persistence of left-leaning beliefs and liberal self-identification among young Americans."
806,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/us/politics/pence-campaign-finance-2024.html,"At a town hall-style event hosted by the right-wing broadcaster Newsmax on Tuesday, Mike Pence was asked questions about Israel, Ukraine and the disarray among House Republicans — all of which he answered in familiar ways.

But he was not asked about the one subject that may now matter more than any of his policy views: his campaign’s perilous financial state.

A campaign finance report that Mr. Pence filed over the weekend painted a dire picture. The former vice president had just $1.2 million in his campaign account, a skimpier reserve than any of the six Republican rivals he shared a debate stage with last month.

Mr. Pence has struggled to achieve the goal he announced when he rolled out his campaign in June — to “reintroduce” himself to voters as his own man, allowing him to step out from the shadow of Donald J. Trump. He has defined himself as a Reagan-era conservative in a party that has largely turned its back on that era: He argues for aid to Ukraine to voters who are isolationist, exudes civility when the base hungers for confrontation and defends his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, while a majority of Republicans falsely believe or suspect that the 2020 election was stolen."
807,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/11/us/politics/scalise-republicans-speaker-house.html,"“While I respect Steve Scalise, the underhanded efforts to rush this vote to the floor without getting full buy-in from the conference is extremely ill-advised and I will not be supporting the nomination on the floor, absent a further discussion,” Representative Michael Cloud, Republican of Texas, said on the social media site X, formerly Twitter.

Other Republicans thought Wednesday’s closed-door conference meeting was that further discussion. They were following what has been the process for congressional leadership elections for decades. A top slot comes open, candidates emerge, they twist arms, make promises, court support and hold issue forums to answer questions. A secret ballot is held, and the winner is the party’s choice. That’s it. But to the consternation of Mr. Scalise’s backers, some on the short end of Wednesday’s 113-to-99 vote seemed to want a do-over.

And that was after Mr. Jordan’s supporters actually lost two separate votes in the meeting — the one for the speakership and an earlier vote to change party rules on how to choose the nominee. The proposal, which was favored by Mr. Jordan and his backers, failed by an even wider margin than Mr. Jordan’s loss to Mr. Scalise, opening the door to his nomination and a floor vote to fill the vacant speaker’s chair.

The fact that many Republicans were unwilling to consider the case closed was stunning considering the history of leadership contests on Capitol Hill. Losers have generally accepted their fate and gotten behind the winners in their party’s political interests. While they might not always have been enthusiastic about the outcome, they did not buck the party and try to overturn it or challenge it. Certainly there have been a few defections, but nothing on the scale of Republicans abandoning Mr. Scalise.

But as the ouster of Mr. McCarthy and the willingness of House Republicans to block routine procedural votes has shown, there is a significant faction of lawmakers who do not see themselves as bound by the traditions of party discipline and loyalty."
808,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/21/world/canada/toronto-airport-theft-gold-brinks.html,"According to a statement of claim that Brink’s and two of its subsidiaries filed with the Federal Court of Canada, the cash and the gold were two separate shipments traveling together. The 53 kilograms of cash worth $1.9 million were sent by a Swiss bank to a Vancouver-based currency exchange. The 400 kilos of gold bars worth 13.6 million Swiss francs, or $15.3 million, were going to Toronto-Dominion Bank from a precious metal refinery in Switzerland. (The value of the cargo is slightly higher than the initial police estimate.) Brink’s said that it was responsible to the shippers for covering any losses if the gold and cash went missing.

Brink’s paid a premium, as a flat-rate handling fee and a percentage of the cargo’s value, to send the shipment through a special Air Canada service called AC Secure that, according to the airline, provides greater security and gives the shipment priority for loading and unloading.

Air Canada Flight 881 from Zurich landed in Toronto a few minutes early, at 3:56 p.m. About 24 minutes later the gold and cash were off the plane, and by 5:50 p.m. they were in an Air Canada warehouse for goods awaiting customs inspection.

About 40 minutes later, according to the court filing, an “unidentified individual” entered the warehouse.

During the three-day trip, the diplomat also met twice with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and with Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. In all, the meetings lasted about 10 hours, U.S. officials said.

Mr. Wang’s trip was a reminder that even as the Biden administration scrambles to manage a new crisis in the Middle East, its top officials remain focused on their top long-term foreign policy priority: managing relations with China.

Those relations have recently been defined by tensions over matters like Chinese espionage and American restrictions on technology exports to China. And they were severely tested in February when a Chinese spy balloon crossed over the United States before a U.S. fighter jet downed it off the coast of North Carolina."
810,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/business/economy/powell-fed-interest-rates.html,"Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, reiterated the central bank’s commitment to moving forward “carefully” with further rate moves in a speech on Thursday. But he also said that the central bank might need to raise interest rates more if economic data continued to come in hot.

Mr. Powell tried to paint a balanced picture of the challenge facing the Fed in remarks before the Economic Club of New York. He emphasized that the Fed is trying to weigh two goals against one another: It wants to wrestle inflation fully under control, but it also wants to avoid doing too much and unnecessarily hurting the economy.

Yet this is a complicated moment for the central bank as the economy behaves in surprising ways. Officials have rapidly raised interest rates to a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent over the past 19 months. Policymakers are now debating whether they need to raise rates one more time in 2023.

The higher borrowing costs are supposed to weigh down economic activity — slowing home buying, business expansions and demand of all sorts — in order to cool inflation. But so far, growth has been unexpectedly resilient. Consumers are spending. Companies are hiring. And while wage gains are moderating, overall growth has been robust enough to make some economists question whether the economy is slowing sufficiently to drive inflation back to the Fed’s 2 percent goal.

“We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand for labor,” Mr. Powell acknowledged on Thursday. “Additional evidence of persistently above-trend growth, or that tightness in the labor market is no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy.”

Mr. Powell called recent growth data a “surprise,” and said that it had come as consumer demand held up much more strongly than had been expected.

“It may just be that rates haven’t been high enough for long enough,” he said, later adding that “the evidence is not that policy is too tight right now.”

Economists interpreted his remarks to mean that while the Fed is unlikely to raise interest rates at its upcoming meeting, which concludes on Nov. 1, it was leaving the door open to a potential rate increase after that. The Fed’s final meeting of the year concludes on Dec. 13.

“It didn’t sound like he was anxious to raise rates again in November,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan, explaining that he thinks the Fed will depend on data as it decides what to do in December.

“He definitely didn’t close the door to further rate hikes,” Mr. Feroli said. “But he didn’t signal anything was imminent, either.”

Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist for Nationwide Mutual, said the comments were “balanced, because there is so much uncertainty.”

The Fed chair had reasons to keep his options open. While growth has been strong in recent data, the economy could be poised for a more marked slowdown.

The Fed has already raised short-term interest rates a lot, and those moves “may” still be trickling out to slow down the economy, Mr. Powell noted. And importantly, long-term interest rates in markets have jumped higher over the past two months, making it much more expensive to borrow to buy a house or a car.

Those tougher financial conditions could affect growth, Mr. Powell said.

“Financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months, and longer-term bond yields have been an important driving factor in this tightening,” he said.

Mr. Powell pointed to several possible reasons behind the recent increase in long-term rates: Higher growth, high deficits, the Fed’s decision to shrink its own security holdings and technical market factors could all be contributing factors.

“There are many candidate ideas, and many people feeling their priors have been confirmed,” Mr. Powell said.

He later added that the “bottom line” was the rise in market rates was “something that we’ll be looking at,” and “at the margin, it could” reduce the impetus for the Fed to raise interest rates further.

The war between Israel and Gaza — and the accompanying geopolitical tensions — also adds to uncertainty about the global outlook. It remains too early to know how it will affect the economy, though it could undermine confidence among businesses and consumers.

“Geopolitical tensions are highly elevated and pose important risks to global economic activity,” Mr. Powell said.

Stocks were choppy as Mr. Powell was speaking, suggesting that investors were struggling to understand what his remarks meant for the immediate outlook on interest rates. Higher interest rates tend to be bad news for stock values.

The S&P 500 ended almost 1 percent lower for the day. The move came alongside a further rise in crucial market interest rates, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising within a whisker of 5 percent, a threshold it hasn’t broken through since 2007.

The Fed chair reiterated the Fed’s commitment to bringing inflation under control even at a complicated moment. Consumer price increases have come down substantially since the summer of 2022, when they peaked around 9 percent. But they remained at 3.7 percent as of last month, still well above the roughly 2 percent that prevailed before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.

“A range of uncertainties, both old ones and new ones, complicate our task of balancing the risk of tightening monetary policy too much against the risk of tightening too little,” Mr. Powell said. “Given the uncertainties and risks, and given how far we have come, the committee is proceeding carefully.”

811,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/01/opinion/christian-nationalism-trump-renew-america.html,"The more I consider the challenge posed by Christian nationalism, the more I think most observers and critics are paying too much attention to the wrong group of Christian nationalists. We mainly think of Christian nationalism as a theology or at least as a philosophy. In reality, the Christian nationalist movement that actually matters is rooted in emotion and ostensibly divine revelation, and it’s that emotional and spiritual movement that so stubbornly clings to Donald Trump.

Three related stories illustrate the challenge.

First, Katherine Stewart wrote a disturbing report for The New Republic about the latest iteration of the ReAwaken America Tour, a radical right-wing road show sponsored by Charisma News, a Pentecostal Christian publication. The tour has attracted national attention, including in The Times, and features a collection of the far right’s most notorious conspiracy theorists and Christian populists.

The rhetoric at these events, which often attract crowds of thousands, is unhinged. There, as Stewart reported, you’ll hear a pastor named Mark Burns declare, “This is a God nation, this is a Jesus nation, and you will never take my God and my gun out of this nation.” You’ll also hear him say, “I have come ready to declare war on Satan and every race-baiting Democrat that tries to destroy our way of life here in the United States of America.” You’ll hear the right-wing radio host Stew Peters call for “Nuremberg Trials 2.0” and death for Anthony Fauci and Hunter Biden. The same speaker taunted the Fulton County, Ga., prosecutor Fani Willis by shouting: “Big Fani. Big fat Fani. Big fat Black Fani Willis.”

Then there’s Thursday’s report in The Times describing how an anti-Trump conservative group with close ties to the Club for Growth is finding that virtually nothing is shaking Trump voters’ confidence in Trump. As the group wrote in a memo to donors, “Every traditional postproduction ad attacking President Trump either backfired or produced no impact on his ballot support and favorability.” Even video evidence of Trump making “liberal” or “stupid” comments failed to shake supporters’ faith in him."

The rejection came hours after Mr. Jordan, his support ebbing, failed on a third floor vote to win the speakership. His defeat left the party with no consensus on a way forward and the chamber paralyzed in the face of growing pressure to get back to business as war raged overseas and a government shutdown grew nearer.

After his colleagues then voted to withdraw Mr. Jordan’s nomination, about a dozen House Republicans, few of them household names, quickly began making calls and exploring bids for speaker.

“We need to come together and figure out who our speaker is going to be,” Mr. Jordan said, acknowledging his defeat. He said he would turn his focus back to the investigations he is leading into the Biden administration as chairman of the Judiciary Committee."
813,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/climate/nightmare-hurricane-otis-developed-in-a-flash.html,"Eric Blake, a forecaster with the National Hurricane Center, called the rapid intensification a “nightmare scenario,” giving the authorities almost no time to warn residents or prepare for the onslaught.

And the storm’s dramatic transformation looks like a sign of things to come.

A recipe for disasters

It’s too early to say whether Hurricane Otis became more powerful so quickly because of man-made climate change. (It often takes months to produce such attribution studies.) But a hotter planet is likely to produce stronger storms, because warmer water holds more energy, and warmer air holds more moisture.

This year is almost certain to be the hottest in recorded history, according to the European Union’s climate change agency, Copernicus. What’s more, Otis formed in a corner of the Pacific Ocean that is unusually warm right now, thanks in part to this year’s El Niño, a naturally occurring atmospheric phenomenon.

The atmosphere is an incredibly complex system, and a number of factors were at work. Nevertheless, the available evidence suggests that “climate change makes Otis more likely to happen,” according to Jonathan Lin, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University who focuses on hurricanes."

Mr. Schumer, who has long taken a tough stand on China, said he would use the trip to appeal to the nation’s top leaders for better economic reciprocity for U.S. companies currently being iced out of Chinese markets and better policing of the export of fentanyl that has increasingly found its way into the United States.

But he offered measured expectations about how much the senators would be able to help resolve the standoff between Washington and Beijing, a goal that has eluded several Biden administration officials.

“I think the Chinese will hear things differently from the elected officials,” Mr. Schumer said during an interview in his Capitol office this week. Members of Congress, he added, “have their finger on the pulse of what the American people are feeling.

California measures its annual rainfall over a water year, which runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30 so that the winter rainy season is captured within a single year. (The state typically gets 75 percent of its annual precipitation between November and March, a feature of its Mediterranean-type climate.)

During the most recent water year, which ended two weeks ago, California received 141 percent of its average annual rainfall, according to state data. The state’s snowpack this spring reached the deepest level recorded in at least 40 years.

816,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/climate/its-all-about-the-grid.html,"Unless the U.S. and other developed countries reinvent their electricity grids, the revolution in clean energy that has given us radically cheaper solar and wind power will be for naught. The clean energy will have nowhere to go.

Point A to Point B

It’s easy to lose sight of the importance of the grid, and just how much work needs to be done.

Solar panels and wind turbines are coming online at a record pace, and clean energy is getting cheaper and more reliable than ever before.

But clean power sources are often situated far from cities where the most people live. That means new transmission lines are needed. Building them is arduous and expensive, and often faces local opposition. And yet without a huge amount of new power lines, the United States is going to have a very tough time meeting its clean energy goals. The Department of Energy says the nation’s vast network of transmission lines may need to expand by two-thirds or more by 2035.

In addition to building new lines, there’s also the challenge of improving existing grids. As Brad has reported, the boom in clean energy ventures has also overwhelmed the system for connecting new power sources to homes and businesses. More than 8,100 energy projects — the vast majority of them wind, solar and batteries — were waiting for permission to connect to electric grids at the end of 2021, up from 5,600 the year before.

“Sometimes you have existing lines where they are basically at capacity, they’re full and they can’t handle adding more wind power or solar power,” Brad said. “Or sometimes the networks can’t handle a bunch of people plugging in their electric vehicles all at once, so they need to be upgraded.”"
817,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/opinion/patrick-mchenry-interim-speaker-powers.html,"House Republicans may not deserve a leader like Mr. McHenry, but they’re fortunate to have him. He is a serious person, widely respected for his honesty and intellect. Previously a member of the House leadership, he left that path to pursue a more policy-focused role leading the important Financial Services Committee. He has also resisted the worst impulses of the current House Republican conference, for example, voting to certify the results of the 2020 election.

The rule elevating Mr. McHenry was a product of a post-9/11 House working group on the continuity of government, intended to ensure that the House could function in an emergency. There is some debate about what powers the speaker pro tempore has under the rule, but it says plainly that the person’s primary responsibility is to oversee the House’s election of a new speaker.

It seems preposterous in the context of Sept. 11 that such a rule would not allow the speaker pro tempore to take emergency legislative action. I’ve spoken with people involved in drafting the rule, however, and they insist it was the intent for the pro tempore to do no more than oversee a speaker election. They never even contemplated the idea that the House couldn’t quickly elect one.

So, what now if it can’t? There are two ways to restart the business of the House without a speaker. The cleanest solution is a vote of the body to give Mr. McHenry the full legislative powers of the speaker, perhaps for only a fixed period. That has been done for planned absences of speakers. But it would, of course, require support from a majority of the House, and we can expect some Republicans to balk at this end around.

There is growing talk of a bipartisan governing arrangement, with Democrats voting to empower Mr. McHenry in exchange for rules favorable to the minority party. We should not place much stock in that. While the House has figuratively lit itself on fire, many Republican members would literally rather do so than allow Democrats to share control over the chamber. If Democrats are seeking something in exchange for their votes, they will instead have to have faith that Mr. McHenry will act fairly and urgently to bring up legislation in support of Israel and Ukraine, as well as to fund our own government."

819,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/opinion/nagorno-karabakh-russia-turkey.html,"The history of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh was ended in the old manner of conflict resolution: siege, conquest, expulsion. After a 10-month blockade, Azerbaijan launched an attack on Sept. 19, claiming the enclave in a day and causing nearly the entire ethnic Armenian population to flee. Give war a chance, as the saying goes.

For Armenians, a classic relic ethnic minority whose Christianity and peculiar alphabet date to the epic struggles between the Romans and the Parthians, it was another genocide. For the Azerbaijanis, Turkic in language and historically Shia Muslim, a great triumph. Yet despite appearances, the conflict is not a Samuel Huntington-style clash of civilizations. Instead, in its emboldening of traditional regional powers like Turkey, scrambling for geopolitical spoils after the retreat of superpowers, it’s a harbinger of the coming world disorder.

Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous region in the South Caucasus, is perennially contested. Ceded by Persia to Russia in the 19th century, it fell into dispute with the emergence of the Soviet Union, Armenia and Azerbaijan both claiming it. In 1921, Stalin attached the enclave to Azerbaijan, home to oil resources and a thriving intellectual culture. Yet the thin crust of Azeri modernist intelligentsia was eliminated in Stalin’s purges of the 1930s and replaced by corrupt functionaries overseen by the formidable K.G.B. general Heydar Aliyev. (His son, Ilham Aliyev, is the dynastic president of Azerbaijan.)

In 1988, Mikhail Gorbachev’s dreams of achieving a more rational, humane Soviet Union emboldened Armenian intellectuals to start a tremendous popular movement for uniting the Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh with mainland Armenia. This seemed deceptively easy: transfer a province from one Soviet republic to another. But the Armenian demands ran into protests in Azerbaijan that almost immediately turned violent. Gorbachev looked impotent in the face of disasters he had provoked. From there to the end of the superpower, it took just three years."

He was 64.

The cause was a pulmonary embolism, said Michael McGowan, his husband.

Over the years, Mr. Lutvak wrote several musicals that were staged in regional theaters and Off Off Broadway. But none were nearly as successful as “A Gentleman’s Guide.”

Set in Edwardian England, it is the story of Monty Navarro, a poor man who, after learning that he is a distant relative of the rich D’Ysquith clan (and then being denied a claim to its lineage), kills the eight kinfolk (all played by one actor) in the line of succession between him and the head of the family, the Ninth Earl of Highhurst.

The show opened in November 2013 and ran for 905 performances over more than two years.

In his review in The New York Times, Charles Isherwood said that the score — Mr. Lutvak wrote the music and collaborated on the lyrics with Robert L. Freedman — “establishes itself as one of the most accomplished (and probably the most literate) to be heard on Broadway in the past dozen years or so, since the less rigorous requirements of pop songwriting have taken over.”"

But it’s not clear whether he will win enough votes on the House floor to get the job. That floor vote may take place in the coming days.

The crisis of terror in Israel has made it even more urgent that the House of Representatives move past its schoolyard infighting, elect itself a speaker and demonstrate that the United States still has a functional government, one that can play a significant role in supporting democratic allies around the globe. So far, however, the Republican House majority has shown no indication it is up to the job.

Only two candidates, Representatives Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Jim Jordan of Ohio, are officially running for speaker. Neither seems to have a majority of Republicans locked up yet, and both are trying to appeal to the party’s worst instincts — making it clear they would perpetuate the chaos that was unleashed during the reign of Kevin McCarthy, who was overthrown by a group of far-right rebels on Oct. 3. In several ways, Mr. Scalise and Mr. Jordan would probably be worse.

Both express opposition to the Biden administration’s request for additional military aid to Ukraine. Like Mr. McCarthy, both have cast doubt on the outcome of the 2020 presidential race, and voted against certifying the election results, a permanent stain on their reputations. But for anyone who cares about basic governmental function, the most worrisome part is that they also seem to be repudiating the two moments when Mr. McCarthy defused a fiscal crisis in recent months — over the debt ceiling and the threatened government shutdown. They want the House to use more “leverage” in its battles against President Biden."
822,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/11/business/wall-street-interest-rates-federal-reserve.html,"Investors are betting that the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates to their highest levels in 22 years, may finally be finished.

Several top Fed officials have indicated in recent days that the central bank’s effort to cool the economy through higher borrowing costs is being amplified by recent market moves that are essentially doing some of that job for them.

In particular, attention has focused on a run-up in interest rates on U.S. government debt, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond briefly touching a two-decade high last week. That yield is incredibly important because it acts as the market’s foundation, underpinning interest rates on many other types of borrowing, from mortgages to corporate debt, and influencing the value of companies in the stock market.

Philip N. Jefferson, the vice chair of the Fed, said this week that although “it may be too soon to say confidently that we’ve tightened enough,” higher market rates can reduce how much businesses and households spend while depressing stock prices. He added that the Fed wanted to avoid doing too much and hurting the economy unnecessarily."
823,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/opinion/decongestant-placebo-medicine.html,"Placebo effects are health improvements initiated from the rituals, symbols and behaviors involved with healing. A 2020 review I co-wrote in the medical journal The BMJ examined data from over 140,000 patients with various chronic pain conditions. We found that placebo responses range from moderate to large and can account for 50 to 75 percent of the benefits of drug treatments for pain. Similar effects can be seen in research around symptoms such as cancer-related fatigue and menopausal hot flashes.

Fifteen years ago, in the middle of my career as a placebo researcher, I had a crisis. My ultimate research goal had been to harness the power of placebo to relieve unnecessary suffering. But my early experiments always involved telling participants that they might receive or were receiving real medications when they were not. Placebos were tainted by trickery. I began to question the conventional dogma that placebos work only if patients don’t know they’re placebos. Could I instead be honest? My colleagues thought I was nuts.

As it turns out, placebos can work even when patients know they are getting a placebo. In 2010 my colleagues and I published a provocative study showing that patients with irritable bowel syndrome who were treated with what we call open-label placebos — as in, we gave them dummy pills and told them so — reported more symptom relief compared with patients who didn’t receive placebos. (These placebos were given with transparency and informed consent.) In another blow to the concept that concealment is required for placebo effects, my team recently published a study comparing open-label placebos and double-blind placebos in irritable bowel syndrome and found no significant difference between the two. A medical myth was overthrown.

Currently, more than a dozen randomized trials demonstrate that open-placebo treatment can reduce symptoms in many illnesses with primarily self-reported symptoms such as chronic low back pain, migraine, knee pain and more. These findings suggest that patients do not have to believe, expect or have faith in placebos to elicit placebo effects. So what’s happening?

To date, the best explanation for the results of open-placebo trials suggests that for certain illnesses in which the brain amplifies symptoms, engaging in a healing drama can nudge the brain to diminish the volume or false alarm of what’s called central sensitization — when the nervous system overemphasizes or amplifies perceptions of discomfort. This mostly involves nonconscious brain processes that scientists call Bayesian brain, which describes how the brain modulates symptoms. The intensification and the relief of symptoms use the same neural pathways. Considerable evidence also shows that placebos, even when patients know they are taking them, trigger the release of neurotransmitters like endorphins and cannabinoids and engage specific regions of the brain to offer relief. Basically, the body has an internal pharmacy that relieves symptoms."
824,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/theater/theatre-de-la-ville-sarah-bernhardt.html,"The closure was never intended to last this long. The initial plan was a partial renovation to bring the Théâtre de la Ville, which hadn’t had a significant upgrade since 1967, up to current security and technical standards. Difficulties quickly piled up, initially because of extensive lead and asbestos, then owing to the Covid pandemic. The total cost, first estimated at 26 million euros, or $27.5 million, ultimately rose to €40 million ($42 million).

The result is a distinctly 21st-century update, which adds yet another layer to what was already an architectural mille-feuille. Inaugurated in 1862, the building was destroyed during the Paris Commune of 1871 and rebuilt a few years later. It was then rebranded several times before the city of Paris chose to reimagine it in 1966. While the facade and roof remained, the Italian-style interior was gutted in favor of a more egalitarian, Brutalist-style auditorium, designed by Jean Perrottet and Valentin Fabre.

The auditorium still feels familiar. While the seats are now a muted shade of sand instead of gray, its concrete underpinnings — dotted here and there with gold leaf — still hang over visitors in the hall. Behind the scenes, however, the stage machinery has been entirely updated. Even the mezzanines are now equipped with curtains and professional lighting, for smaller in situ performances.

And Demarcy-Mota, Théâtre de la Ville’s director since 2008, is attempting to make up for lost time. In early October, the reopening was marked with a free 26-hour performance marathon, “The Great Vigil,” starring around 300 artists from the fields of dance, theater and music."

827,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/us/jordan-speaker-analysis.html,"After Republicans pulled the plug on a second speaker vote on Tuesday, Representative Hakeem Jeffries went out to the Capitol steps to castigate Republicans for their predicament. He urged them to work with Democrats to find a solution, though he was not specific what that might be. He suggested he did not expect Republican support to become speaker himself but said that there were “many good men and women on the Republican side of the aisle who are qualified to be the speaker of the House of Representatives” — not including Mr. Jordan, he added, calling him the “poster boy for MAGA extremism.”

It was not a sign of strength on the part of Mr. Jordan and his supporters that after declaring there would be a second vote on Tuesday, they abandoned that strategy, presumably aware that they would lose again. His detractors, on the other hand, had pushed for an immediate reconsideration of the vote, hoping they could defeat him a second time and perhaps push him to step aside as Mr. Scalise did last week when it became clear he could not prevail on the floor.

Mr. Jordan and his allies hoped to work the holdouts through a mix of pleas for party unity, negotiations and a social-media fueled pressure campaign that was already stirring a backlash and could cause more defections in the next round. Mr. Jordan also was apparently rebuffed by Mr. Scalise when he asked for help in converting those still simmering over the treatment of the majority leader.

Even as the arm-twisting proceeded, there were questions about what it would take for Mr. Jordan to withdraw should he fall short a second time, given that he has made his reputation as a partisan brawler willing to take a fight as far as possible. Mr. McCarthy, of course, endured 14 rounds of voting back in January before winning the speakership on the 15th and Mr. Jordan might be reluctant to quickly surrender, particularly if he was picking up support even ever so slightly.

The floor showdown also gave Republicans a taste of what they could expect from Democrats if they did end up going with Mr. Jordan. As Representative Pete Aguilar of California, the No. 3 House Democrat, put forward Mr. Jeffries as the Democratic nominee for speaker, he took the rare step of assailing Mr. Jordan at the same time, providing a template for his party’s political attacks on Republicans who embraced the Ohio Republican. He served notice that every comment and position Mr. Jordan had made or taken would be hung around the neck of House Republicans who backed him — and 200 did so on Tuesday, even as he fell short."

Organizers said that last year’s exhibition there by Simone Leigh cost about $7 million. But curators say financial support from the State Department has not kept pace with the increases.

“We consider private-sector support a strength in our approach to this program, as it creates broad engagement with a wide variety of stakeholders,” a spokesman for the State Department said. “We always aim to optimize the value to the U.S. taxpayer.”

The budget for the Venice Biennale international exhibition, which hosts the work of dozens of foreign countries as well as Italy, was nearly $19 million in 2022, but it receives substantial financial support from the Italian government. (The budget is the same this year, according to the organizers.)

“I think there is an understanding even before a selection is made that if you apply, then you have the ability to fundraise,” said Brooke Kamin Rapaport, artistic director and chief curator at Madison Square Park Conservancy and the commissioner of the $3.8 million Venice exhibition by the sculptor Martin Puryear in 2019. “In that sense, it is self-selecting.”

Asking for donations from collectors and gallerists, while it has become part of the job, raises ethical concerns for some curators, including those who have previously run the show.

The bakery’s expansion is part of a wider, albeit modest, economic recovery in Ukraine. Although Ukraine’s economic output is still considerably smaller than before the war — the economy shrank by one-third after Russia’s full-scale invasion last year — it will grow by an estimated 3.5 percent this year, the World Bank predicts.

Michael Janofsky wrote in The New York Times about the growing inclusion of disabled artists in exhibitions around the country, and visited the center, Creative Growth, where many of them got their start. A nonprofit organization, Creative Growth was founded in 1974 by Elias Katz, a Bay Area psychologist, and his wife, Florence Ludins-Katz, an artist who believed that art is a fundamental right and an essential part of human development.

At the center, a converted auto repair shop near downtown, as many as 90 artists may be working on any given day — painting, designing video games, sewing clothes, woodworking and more. The artists generally have no formal training, and create whatever they like with no outside instruction.

Michael told me that he appreciated the brilliance in these pieces. Some, he said, are so wondrous that they are widely sought by major international museums and sell for $50,000 and more. “That’s a real tribute to the artist and the art center that provides the means to create,” he said.

Michael was particularly dazzled by Monica Valentine, whose specialty is decorating various shapes of plastic foam with pins bearing colorful beads. In her work, the pins were always placed in a design pattern that never appeared haphazard or incidental, he said, which was remarkable because Valentine is blind.

But, also this year, I met the new great-granddaughter Aurora, who was born in late January. She is a beautiful, mellow, lovable baby. Life takes away and also gives us delights. My sisters would have loved her.” — Annie Jelnick, Corona del Mar

“We’ve been growing tomatoes since we became members of our community garden in Los Angeles in 2018, but the past years we were not successful in getting many tomatoes despite planting about a dozen plants. This year was different. I tended our tomatoes with so much care and attention. The hard work paid off, and I was able to harvest a basket full of tomatoes of different varieties almost every week this summer. The joy was sharing something I love and worked hard for.” — Marissa Balancio, Los Angeles

“The best thing that happened to me this year was being the officiant at my daughter’s wedding. I was shocked last year when she and her fiancé asked if I would marry them. ‘Why me?’ I asked. My daughter replied, ‘Because you never cry at weddings.’ That was her reason? Really? I’ll admit it was difficult not to cry when I saw my husband walking her down the aisle, but the wide smile on her face made me smile broadly, and all thoughts of tears vanished. So, two kids who met on Bumble tied the knot under my loving direction. I’m tearing up now.” — Holly Hartz, Moraga

“My partner and I went to Anza-Borrego to see and film the recent solar eclipse. As we sat in lawn chairs with darkened glasses, many campers asked what we were doing. Explanations about the eclipse ensued, and we shared our glasses with many campers. It was especially delightful to share with many middle and high school students. Perhaps the experience will spark an interest in astronomy or science!” — Janet Linnea Means, Laguna Hills"
834,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/us/politics/biden-artificial-intelligence.html,"Mr. Biden’s order will be issued days before a gathering of world leaders on A.I. safety organized by Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak. On the issue of A.I. regulation, the United States has trailed the European Union, which has been drafting new laws, and other nations, like China and Israel, that have issued proposals for regulations. Ever since ChatGPT, the A.I.-powered chatbot, exploded in popularity last year, lawmakers and global regulators have grappled with how artificial intelligence might alter jobs, spread disinformation and potentially develop its own kind of intelligence.

“President Biden is rolling out the strongest set of actions any government in the world has ever taken on A.I. safety, security and trust,” said Bruce Reed, a White House deputy chief of staff. “It’s the next step in an aggressive strategy to do everything on all fronts to harness the benefits of A.I. and mitigate the risks.”

The new U.S. rules, some of which are set to go into effect in the next 90 days, are likely to face many challenges, some legal and some political. But the order is aimed at the most advanced future systems, and it largely does not address the immediate threats of existing chatbots that could be used to spread disinformation related to Ukraine, Gaza or the presidential campaign.

The administration did not release the language of the executive order on Sunday, but officials said that some of the steps in the order would require approval by independent agencies, like the Federal Trade Commission.

The order affects only American companies, but because software development happens around the world, the United States will face diplomatic challenges enforcing the regulations, which is why the administration is attempting to encourage allies and adversaries alike to develop similar rules. Vice President Kamala Harris is representing the United States at the conference in London on the topic this week."
835,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/opinion/mike-johnson-trump-speaker.html,"Every Republican present in the chamber voted on Wednesday for Mr. Johnson, reflecting the exhaustion of a party that has been ridiculed for incoherence since it deposed Mr. McCarthy for working with Democrats to fulfill the basic function of Congress, to fund the federal government. The choice of Mr. Johnson came after Mr. Trump helped engineer the result by torpedoing a more moderate candidate, setting the stage for the 2024 presidential election to unfold with someone in the speaker’s chair who has proved his willingness to go to great lengths to overturn a free and fair vote.

It’s obvious why the former president was so supportive of the new speaker. Mr. Johnson was “the most important architect of the Electoral College objections” to Mr. Trump’s loss in 2020, as a New York Times investigation found last year. He made unfounded arguments questioning the constitutionality of state voting rules; he agreed with Mr. Trump that the election was “rigged,” cast doubt on voting machines and supported a host of other baseless and unconstitutional theories that ultimately led to a violent insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

Mr. Johnson now refuses to talk about his leading role in that shameful drama. When a reporter for ABC News tried to ask him about it on Tuesday night, he would not respond; his fellow Republicans booed the question, and one yelled at the reporter to “shut up.” Such questions cannot be dismissed when Mr. Trump is the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Though changes in the law and Democratic control of the Senate make it much harder for the House of Representatives to impede certification of the vote, the American public deserves a speaker of the House who will uphold the will of the people, not someone willing to bend the rules of an election for his side.

More immediately, while his election as speaker will make it possible for the House to continue functioning, it is not clear that Mr. Johnson is committed to the work of actually governing. At the end of September, he voted against the stopgap spending measure negotiated by Mr. McCarthy that prevented a government shutdown. That bill was an important litmus test; Mr. McCarthy brought it to a vote and got it passed with bipartisan support, over the objections of Mr. Trump, leading to his downfall as speaker. Two other Republican speaker candidates, Tom Emmer and Steve Scalise, also voted for it — and were also vetoed by the extreme right.

Mr. Johnson now says he would support another stopgap to give the House time to pass drastic spending cuts. That promise may have won over the Republicans who blocked the candidacy of another extremist, Jim Jordan, last week. But Mr. Johnson’s voting record so far leaves little doubt that he prefers the performance of taking positions to actual lawmaking."

The attack put President Emmanuel Macron’s government under intense pressure as officials acknowledged that the main suspect in the attack and several of his family members had been identified by intelligence services as radicalized or had been convicted on terrorism charges.

The suspect was even taken in for questioning the day before the assault, officials said, but was let go after it was determined that he did not pose an immediate threat.

The stabbing took place at the Gambetta-Carnot public school in Arras, a town of about 42,000, roughly 25 miles southwest of Lille, near the Belgian border."

The attack has also renewed calls for the authority to install additional protective features like platform barriers that could help keep transit riders from falling onto the tracks.

Assemblyman Alex Bores, whose district includes the subway station where the pushing occurred on Wednesday, said he was frustrated by the M.T.A.’s slow pace in installing barriers, like waist-high metal gates.

“We need to get ridership back up to where it was prepandemic,” Mr. Bores said. “There’s many things we can do to increase it. Among those is safety and the perception of safety, and I think fixed barriers go a long way.”

In a subway system used by roughly four million riders on an average weekday, being shoved onto tracks is rare. This year through Oct. 15, there had been 15 people pushed off subway platforms in New York City, compared with 22 during the same period last year, the police said. Officials could not say how many of the episodes resulted in serious injuries but said that many of those who were shoved were able to emerge safely.

Leaders at the M.T.A. are sensitive not only to crime rates in the system, but also to how safe riders feel. Even though violent attacks in the system are relatively uncommon, the idea of being pushed onto train tracks is a powerful fear for many riders."

Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio picked up steam on Monday in his bid to become speaker, winning over several of his biggest opponents in the fractured G.O.P. ranks even as deep reservations remained about elevating him to the top post in the House.

Several mainstream Republicans who had said they could not countenance a vote for Mr. Jordan, the hard-line co-founder of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, fell into line after a pressure campaign by his right-wing allies and a series of one-on-one calls with him.

Their reversals suggested that Mr. Jordan was within striking distance of the 217 votes he would need to be elected in a planned vote around noon on Tuesday. But the outcome remained far from certain.

“The role of the speaker is to bring all Republicans together. That’s what I intend to do,” Mr. Jordan said in a letter sent to his Republican colleagues on Monday. In it, Mr. Jordan acknowledged the deep divisions in the G.O.P. and said he would give more lawmakers input into the party’s agenda."

Well, it works too for dementia: that dull and darkening cloud that will dim more and more people’s lives as baby boomers enter old age. “An insidious fog, barely noticeable until everything around has disappeared,” the literary critic John Bayley called it in “Elegy for Iris,” his 1998 memoir of a vivid marriage to the novelist Iris Murdoch that was blurred by her Alzheimer’s diagnosis.

Alzheimer’s is the most common variant of dementia, like tequila is to mezcal — both of which might come in handy if you are helping care for someone with the disease.

I’ve watched some version of it descend on both of my parents (hi Mom, for whom the print edition of The New York Times remains a blessed daily guidepost). Small incidents accumulate, snowflakes falling on the ground. A credit-card bill unpaid; a date forgotten; an episode of disorientation at a familiar train station — these might get excused and melt away.

840,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/opinion/cars-pedestrians-death.html,"Now, there is some data we can bring to bear on this question. According to a study from the Florida Department of Transportation, cyclists and drivers comply with traffic laws at about the same rate: 88 percent for the former versus 85 percent for the latter. And according to a 2020 study by Rutgers University on pedestrian accidents, distracted walking factors into a relatively small share of crashes, between an estimated 5 and 10 percent of the total. If cyclists are scofflaws and pedestrians are uniformly distracted by phones, it’s not yet showing up in the research.

But the point I want to make is not that there’s no evidence to suggest that cyclists and pedestrians are unusually transgressive or inattentive, but that the focus on their behavior is beside the point.

The most dangerous things on our streets are cars and trucks, multiton chunks of metal, glass and plastic designed to move at high speeds through urban and suburban environments that are, more often than not, designed for the flow of vehicles rather than the movement of people. Nearly everything about our transportation infrastructure exists to tell drivers that they have pride of place on our roads and streets and that their convenience is more important than any other consideration. And too many drivers have gotten the message, ignoring any responsibility to those outside their vehicle in favor of whatever behavior allows them to make the fastest journey from point A to point B.

The rise in pedestrian and cyclist deaths is first and foremost a product of design: design of cities, design of our streets, design of our vehicles. To the extent that we can trace it to behavior, it is behavior that has been inculcated by those design choices. But even if there are behavioral flaws to find as everyone moves around outdoors — drivers, cyclists and pedestrians alike — the consequences of scofflaw behavior from drivers are simply much greater, and much worse, than the consequences of scofflaw behavior from other people on the street.

The problem, ultimately, is about cars and trucks. And the focus, ultimately, should be on cars and trucks."

Since Republicans control the House with only four votes to spare, a small hard-right minority has flexed its muscles repeatedly to the consternation of the mainstream conservatives who form the bulk of the conference. The refusal of some of them to go along with Mr. Jordan’s election was an unusual show of force from a group that more commonly seeks compromise and conciliation.

But Tuesday’s vote also indicated how sharply the G.O.P. has veered to the right. Though Mr. Jordan failed to win a majority, 200 Republicans — including many of those more mainstream members — voted to give him the job second in line to the presidency. That was a remarkable show of support for Mr. Jordan, 59, who helped Mr. Trump try to overturn the 2020 election and has used his power in Congress to defend the former president. Mr. Jordan has a long track record of opposing compromise that prompted a previous Republican speaker to brand him a “legislative terrorist.”

Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, formally nominated Mr. Jordan, a former wrestling champion, on the floor on Tuesday and cast his bruising style as a virtue. “Whether on the wrestling mat or in the committee room, Jim Jordan is strategic, scrappy, tough and principled,” she said."

And while the selection of Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana as speaker offers immediate relief from an exhausting, internecine process, his elevation does little to address the underlying conflict that led to Kevin McCarthy’s demise as speaker.

While far from a household name, even by congressional standards, Mr. Johnson is well situated to bridge a divided conference. As vice chairman of the G.O.P. conference, he has been an elected member of leadership without being a part of its core; he is a former chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee and a Judiciary Committee ally of Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio but with a mild temperament that endears him to the establishment wing of the party. He has signaled an openness to the job but resisted being caught up in the fray, thereby managing to avoid the sort of commitments that would limit his options.

Mr. Johnson is not your prototypical party leader, and his mere candidacy sent many in Washington scrambling for their Congressional Directory. And in some ways this was the point — a clean break from the McCarthy mold of speaker as pure political animal. But while his unassuming manner, ideological credentials with conservatives and initial good will present an opportunity to navigate what was always going to be a rocky end-of-year path, the same power dynamics that brought the last speaker to his knees remain on a collision course with the realities of divided government.

If this resolution seems anticlimactic in the wake of such a dramatic ouster and shambolic interregnum, it speaks to the capriciousness of the entire exercise — and why we could easily see the cycle begin anew."

He has given dozens of speeches on the floor of the House and attended local events, as though maybe, if he kept on message, a day would come when people stopped asking whether he had stolen from a dying dog.

In fact, the higher yields and lower prices in the market today mean that this is an excellent time to buy bonds.

For most people, the easiest way to do this is through a broad low-cost mutual fund or exchange-traded fund. Bonds make sense because, despite their recent problems, they still have traditional virtues.

Core Values

Two fundamental factors make bonds important, said Paul Olmsted, a senior researcher at Morningstar:their essential function of generating reliable income, and their ability, most of the time, to provide diversification in a broad investment portfolio containing stocks.

“The bond market is self-healing,” he said. The damage wreaked by rising interest rates will be remedied, over time, by those higher rates. If your investment horizon is long, he said, the yields generated by your bond fund will produce higher total returns, more than making up for the losses you may have endured over the past few years.

Robert Pozen, the former president of Fidelity who is now a senior lecturer at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, said it made sense at today’s interest rates to hold individual Treasuries or investment-grade corporate bonds of, say, five to 10 years maturity, if you need a safe investment for a specific purpose and period, such as paying for a child’s education or financing your retirement."

One lawmaker in the Republican-led Wyoming Legislature called President Biden’s plan an attempt at “total government control.” Another declared it the worst disaster in American history, affecting “more people than the Civil War, Pearl Harbor and 9/11 combined.” Some spread fears that China would influence the government’s decision-making. A federal lands manager said she had received violent threats, prompting an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The 1,350-page proposal for managing 3.6 million of acres of federal land in Southwest Wyoming was years in the making but still took many Wyoming residents by surprise when the Bureau of Land Management made it public in August.

In addition to blocking energy development on nearly half that land, or 1.6 million acres, the plan would also restrict mining and some grazing.

The same goes for Adam Bierton, who puts the snarly faces in pumpkins at the New York Botanical Garden. (Bierton once worked for Maniac Pumpkin Carvers, the company Evan runs with a partner, Chris Soria.)

“I’m getting hundreds of pumpkins brought into the studio every week — we really stopped counting,” Evan said. “Sometimes we’re delivering 50 pumpkins to one venue for their decorations, to dress it up and make a Halloween installation. Other times, we’re sending one pumpkin that’s going to go in somebody’s window or on their porch.”

Adding to the October rush is fall-themed advertising. “A lot of time, visible pumpkins don’t leave the studio,” he said. “We film the process or do a photo-shoot, and the end product is the digital files.”

Maniac Pumpkins has carved for the Whitney Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Modern Art, copying Magrittes, Picassos and Warhols onto pumpkins. “We’re not trying to capture the colors of the original painting so much as being faithful to the nuances, the brushstrokes, the details and the value range — the range from light to dark,” Evan said.

Working in pumpkin is not like chipping away at marble or like shaping clay. Pumpkin is “a perishable, ephemeral medium,” Evan said. “It’s something that’s meant to be enjoyed in the moment. It rots very quickly. Some people are horrified by the idea that we put so much work and love into something that is only going to last maybe a few days.”"

Until recently, that simple argument would have been persuasive enough to convince most voters in this part of New York. But times have changed, and so has the political makeup of certain swaths of the city: Even though Democrats outnumber Republicans in the district by three to one, Republicans won three competitive state legislative seats in southern Brooklyn in 2022.

852,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/arts/music/madonna-celebration-tour-london.html,"In the past, Madonna’s tours have been news-making events tied as much to her latest music as to her cycle of stylistic reinventions. But Celebration is essentially the pop superstar’s Eras Tour, as Taylor Swift has styled her latest outing: a staged romp through decades of hit songs and signature looks, giving fans a chance to relive her career as a stages-of-life experience. (Seventeen of Madonna’s previous costumes were recreated for the tour, and some of the merchandise for sale includes replicas from past treks.)

With her Virgin Tour in 1985, Madonna introduced herself as a punk-glam dance star whose every crucifix pendant or flap of denim was zealously adopted by fans. Who’s That Girl (1987) and Blond Ambition (1990) grew increasingly elaborate as Madonna pushed the fashion envelope with looks like Jean Paul Gaultier’s memorable cone bra and set the bar for bold, imaginative pop megatours. The Girlie Show (1993), in which Madonna appeared as a dominatrix, was the accompaniment to a period of daringly explicit material like her “Sex” book and “Justify My Love” video, which was banned from MTV.

After an eight-year absence from the road, Drowned World (2001) reintroduced Madonna as a new mother, an electro-pop heroine and an acolyte of kabbalah, a form of Jewish mysticism. In more recent years, her Confessions Tour (2006) cast her in late-70s disco style, and Rebel Heart (2015-16) found her playing guitar, in addition to executing the complex choreography for which she is known. Her most recent tour, Madame X, which was cut short by the Covid-19 pandemic, saw Madonna looking to reinvent her stage performance once again in a more intimate, almost cabaret form, mostly eschewing arenas for spaces like the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

For Madonna, the 78-date Celebration Tour is a chance to assert her star power in a year when live music has been dominated by Swift and Beyoncé — women who, like Madonna before them, have used talent and deep media savvy to remake pop stardom in their own image. In July, Beyoncé acknowledged the debt, when Madonna, making one of her first public appearances after her hospitalization, attended Beyoncé’s Renaissance World Tour in New Jersey. “Big shout-out to the queen,” Beyoncé called out during a performance of the “Queens Remix” of her song “Break My Soul,” which blends in Madonna’s 1990 smash “Vogue” — another hit that mined, and honored, gay dance culture of that period.

Madonna returned the acknowledgment on Saturday, playing a bit of the same remix during an interstitial moment."
853,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/opinion/biden-trump-age-reelect.html,"President Biden’s age is on the minds of American voters as they think about the 2024 election. It’s no wonder: In a poll I did last year, there was broad support (63 percent of Democrats, 55 percent of Republicans and 61 percent of independents) for establishing an upper age limit of 70 for any person to be sworn in as president. This past July, a Pew Research Center survey found that about half of respondents believed the best age range for a U.S. president was in the 50s — well below Mr. Biden’s 80 and Donald Trump’s 77.

As a pollster and strategist who has been involved in four Democratic presidential campaigns, including Barack Obama’s re-election campaign in 2012, I don’t believe that age will determine this election. But it is a formidable reality that Mr. Biden and his team must deal with and transcend, just as Ronald Reagan did at age 73 in his 1984 re-election race. Mr. Reagan passed that test, removing age as a distraction for his campaign and voters and making the contest about “morning in America,” our economic turnaround and our leadership in the world. The 2024 election is going to hinge similarly on core issues and a vision that speaks directly to the lives and hopes of voters.

Getting past the age question won’t be easy. It will involve persuading voters in memorable ways and will require a deft touch. But this is a winnable race for the president, even if it sometimes seems his team is shielding him from the public. The fact is, he’s old. A failure to confront the issue risks reinforcing that impression rather than overcoming it. Americans will be watching him closely in big moments, like his trip to Israel this week to deal with one of the most significant crises of his presidency. The Biden team needs to get the president out in front of the public more, finding opportunities for him to talk about age with a directness and confidence that convinces people it isn’t the core issue. Talk about it now so you aren’t talking about it next summer, then use the fall debates in 2024 to deliver a Reaganesque line that puts the topic to bed.

If Mr. Trump becomes Mr. Biden’s opponent, this task is simpler. They’re both old, so I think the question of age will become moot for a lot of voters. Winning presidential candidates learn quickly not to launch attacks that can come back and bite them. Take Mitt Romney’s debate-stage effort in 2012 to cast Mr. Obama as unfit to be commander in chief over his handling of a deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. Mr. Obama’s stinging response won the president headlines praising his smackdown performance: “While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and that’s not how a commander in chief operates,” Mr. Obama said."

He sold his limousines and took subways or cabs. He also resolved to give his money away anonymously, a course followed by only 1 percent of American givers, experts say.

“All Feeney’s instincts, instilled in him by the example of his parents, by the sharing culture of his blue-collar upbringing in New Jersey, by his desire not to distance himself from his boyhood neighbors and friends, and by his own innate kindness and concern for others, undoubtedly shaped his decision,” Mr. O’Clery wrote.

It was in 1982 that Mr. Feeney established in Bermuda the foundation that would become Atlantic Philanthropies. In 1984, he transferred to the foundation his 38.75 percent stake in the company he had co-founded, Duty Free Shoppers. Since there was no sale, the company’s value was speculative, but some estimates said it may have exceeded $500 million.

Over the ensuing decades, as his other enterprises and profits also went to the foundation, Mr. Feeney funded public-health facilities in Vietnam; the University of Limerick and Trinity College in Ireland; AIDS clinics in South Africa; Operation Smile’s free surgeries for children with cleft lips and palates; a medical campus for the University of California at San Francisco; and earthquake relief in Haiti. He gave $1 billion to Cornell, including $350 million for an affiliated technology institute in New York City.

Legal filings put the value of his share at $1.6 billion and said it belonged not to Mr. Feeney but to his philanthropic entity in Bermuda, which had been making huge anonymous donations for 15 years."

When you dig down, what you realize is this is not a recovery that’s being felt equally by all New Yorkers.

Yes, jobs are back, but they’re not the same quality as the ones lost, at least in terms of income.

Two sectors that were hit hard were retail and hospitality. For a snapshot, consider this: From February 2020 — the last full month before the pandemic lockdown — to September 2023, the retail sector lost almost 40,000 jobs, more than any other industry.

Retail workers averaged $62,000 a year. That’s below the median household income in New York City, but it’s still a decent wage.

In the same period, the city’s biggest growth industry was home health care, where workers averaged just half of what retail workers made — $31,000 a year. Home health aides do important work and very difficult work, but the pay is lower than for many of the jobs we lost.

Beyond that, another surprising statistic is that the typical household in New York is making less now than before Covid. How much less?"

Trump’s presidency was a period not just of steady growth and low unemployment, but also of growth that was more widely shared than in much of the recent past — with the strongest improvement in median incomes since the 1990s, wage growth for middle- and low-income workers outpacing growth for the upper class, and the lowest African American unemployment rate in decades.

Some of these trends have persisted, as this newsletter has discussed previously, into the Biden presidency, but they’ve been undermined by inflation and shadowed by rising interest rates, creating an economic picture that’s more fraught than some of Biden’s boosters want to acknowledge. (Even this week’s eye-popping G.D.P. number — third-quarter growth at a 4.9 percent rate — coexists with data showing disposable personal income actually dipping just a bit, suggesting that the post-Covid stagnation in real earnings hasn’t fully broken yet.) Whereas the Trump era was less complicated: For a few short years, the American economy performed in ways Americans once took for granted, closer to the long post-World War II boom than to the decades of recession-punctuated deceleration we’ve experienced since the 1970s.

Lately, I’ve been reading a portrait of that long age of disappointment — “Ours Was the Shining Future: The Story of the American Dream,” a new book by my Times colleague and former podcast sparring partner David Leonhardt. It’s a rich economic history of the post-World War II era, enlivened with both personal anecdotes (including some Leonhardt family history) and biographical sketches of famous or once-famous figures, from C. Wright Mills to Robert Bork and Barbara Jordan, whose ideas illuminate the larger transformations Leonhardt describes.

The book’s argument belongs to a genre, reconsiderations of neoliberalism, that’s somewhat familiar by now but is usually more narrowly polemical, where my colleague offers sweep and detail and depth of historical narrative. And the genre’s entries usually come from predictable “outsider” ideological perspectives, from the far left or lately the populist right, assailing the neoliberal age in the voice of its traditional enemies. Whereas Leonhardt, I think it’s fair to say, is a man of the moderate center-left both in ideological predispositions and in personal temperament, which lends his reconsiderations a more unpredictable aspect and gives some of his criticisms greater heft."

That year she was named a fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects. Mr. Birnbaum told the New York magazine site Curbed that in all of Ms. Pattison’s projects “you see the hand of an artist.”

Hers was a complicated life. Her romance with Mr. Kahn, who was nearly 28 years her senior, occurred while he was married to another woman. And for many years, while she raised her son and tried to establish herself as a landscape architect, she all but hid herself away.

“I was with a man I loved; I had a child I adored and a path toward a career,” she wrote in a memoir, published in 2020. “But these had cost me the acceptance of ‘society.’ I felt caught between two eras, and even two parts of myself.”

Ms. Pattison never married, and she lived alone until her death.

To viewers of Mr. Kahn’s film, she may have seemed to have sacrificed everything for a man she couldn’t marry. By contrast, her book, “Our Days Are Like Full Years: A Memoir With Letters From Louis Kahn,” portrays her as a woman who built a career and a family despite great challenges.

The book includes hundreds of letters, telegrams and postcards that Ms. Pattison received from Mr. Kahn in the 15 years before his death. The letters are intimate, revealing and self-deprecating; one, sent from Pakistan on March 31, 1965, begins: “Sweetie, The conquering hero has conquered nothing.” They often included sketches of buildings or drawings of imaginary animals for young Nathaniel. Some document their professional collaborations.

For weeks, Speaker Kevin McCarthy had brushed off demands to work with Democrats on a spending solution. Yesterday morning, though, McCarthy changed course. He informed House Republicans of the compromise plan, then rushed to get it to the floor, where he wasn’t sure it would pass.

“I like to gamble,” he said.

Democrats initially complained that McCarthy had sprung the plan on them without much time to scrutinize it. But they didn’t want to be accused of putting aid for Ukraine ahead of keeping the government open. Ultimately, they supported the bill, which passed 335 to 91. Ninety Republicans and one Democrat voted against it. (See how each member voted.)

Hard-right Republicans refused to support the stopgap bill because it essentially maintained funding at levels set when Congress was under Democratic control last year. Some had threatened to oust McCarthy from the speakership if he made a deal with the Democrats.

McCarthy recognized that the legislation might spark a challenge to his job, but said he was willing to risk it to keep the government open. “If someone wants to make a motion against me, bring it,” he said at a news conference after the House passed the bill. “There has to be an adult in the room.”

Members of both parties said they believed they could win money for Ukraine in the weeks ahead. But the decision to leave it out of the spending bill was a disappointment for the Biden administration. It was also a sign of Republicans’ waning support for funding the war."

Even before the court moved to the right over the past several years, business regulation was an area in which its rulings tended to be conservative. Thirteen years ago, Adam wrote an article explaining that the court led by Chief Justice John Roberts was the most business-friendly Supreme Court in modern history.

Roberts and his colleagues tend to be skeptical of government regulation that tries to protect the environment, consumer safety or workers’ rights. In all these areas, the court has often taken a laissez-faire approach, allowing corporations to behave as their executives think best.

This outlook hasn’t been restricted to Republican-appointed judges, either. Democratic appointees who lean left on social issues like abortion, gay rights and guns have been more conservative on business regulation. This shift has been part of the so-called neoliberal revolution in economic policy that took off in the 1980s. Free markets, according to this view, are more efficient than government can be."

The path laid out by Gorman has made Morgan Stanley the envy of the financial world and helped it outpace its longtime rival, Goldman Sachs. Pick will face the challenge of keeping the momentum going as volatile markets weigh down core businesses such as deal making.

Pick won a contest worthy of an HBO drama. Morgan Stanley’s board selected him over Andy Saperstein, who leads wealth management, and Dan Simkowitz, who oversees asset management. Those divisions have both been growing fast.

“I’m all for heroism,” Marina Abramovic says. “I love heroism.” And at 76, after a long and groundbreaking career, she is largely viewed by the art world in heroic terms. Abramovic is currently the subject of a show at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, where she is the first female artist to host a major solo exhibition in the main galleries of the 255-year-old institution. She also has two new books: the lavish “Marina Abramovic: A Visual Biography,” a sort of life-spanning scrapbook accompanied by an expansive series of interviews conducted by Katya Tylevich, as well as “Marina Abramovic: Nomadic Journey and Spirit of Places.” That one is also in the scrapbook-y vein, a collection of the roaming artist’s travel notes and sketches. If that all seems like a lot of looking back for such a forward-thinking artist, well, it’s occurring in the shadow of an event that would cause a little reflection: Earlier this year, Abramovic, whose work has so often been rooted in fearlessly enduring pain, suffered a life-threatening pulmonary embolism. “Physical pain, I understand how to control,” Abramovic says about her health scare. “That I could not control this was frightening.”

You said the public can see itself in your work and relate to your relationship to pain. But you choose to undergo pain. So how much of an analogue can your work be for people who aren’t choosing pain? It’s complicated. So many people choose to take pain as a way of life; there’s people who live a painful life in order to punish other people who they don’t want to be happy. To me it’s really about the choices you make in your life. I am giving you the possibility of different choices. You can find bliss and be happy; you don’t need to be with somebody you don’t love. I wanted to inspire people about freedom in their life and the choices they make. You see the suffering, you see honesty, you see the incredible difficulties — and they’re overcome. We need examples in order to lift our spirit and be inspired.

But it feels strange to be happy? Yes! We are living in the strangest period of human history. We are ending this year with two wars: in Ukraine and Israel. Then there are natural disasters. Things are not getting better. We have to understand that the only reality we have is living every day as if it’s the last. Which is also the philosophy of performance: to be in the moment. How important are we? We are dust. I was also thinking how interesting it is that in war, when everybody was making art that reflected what happened, Henri Matisse was painting flowers. I finally understand that. The way to fight is not to reflect horror and put your spirit down. It’s to create something with beauty that gives you hope.

You don’t think any good art comes from happiness? Louis Armstrong or Stevie Wonder — Ah! Music is a whole different issue because singing, in general, you have to sing from your heart and open your heart. I’m talking about visual art. I’m talking about literature. Especially writers. You think Beckett is happy? You think Kafka is happy? Do you think Dostoyevsky is happy? Is Proust happy?

Maybe when his character bites the madeleine or hears Vinteuil’s sonata. OK, I’ll give you the madeleine.

Abramovic during a performance in the early 1970s. From the Marina Abramovic Archives

You said we’re dust. But there is an element of grandiosity about you. How do you balance those two ideas? Yesterday I had a woman run to give me a child to hold because it was good luck. I said, “My God, this is too much!” The ego is the most dangerous thing for an artist. That you start believing in your grandeur, that’s the end of your creativity. So many great artists are [expletive] human beings. But I don’t want to be one of them! I see artists as servants of society. Before, the artist was serving the popes and aristocrats and Medici. Now it’s industry and banks or whatever. But performance art never became a commodity because it’s immaterial.

Performance art never became a commodity? There’s this whole apparatus — the Venice Biennale and Documenta and curators — and all this money is being spent. It’s not outside the art market, but I was teaching and making money in different ways — not because I was paid for a performance. It all looks very glamorous: You have great openings, you’re drinking Champagne. But this is not what it’s about. I spent all of my life to move performance art to the mainstream. I did it, and when you’re talking about a commodity, it’s such a little achievement. If you think of anybody else selling work for millions, it’s the opposite for performance people. I still have a huge mortgage to pay. I still have to work every day because I never have the kind of money like artists who produce objects.

On social media, you can see people doing things that have the DNA of performance art: filming themselves sleeping, or doing things considered inappropriate in public with their bodies. But that’s all about trying to monetize lives and become influencers. Do you see any connections between what people do on social media and performance art? This has nothing to do with art. Some years ago, I was invited to Silicon Valley to talk about the future of art. I was talking about my prediction that the future will be immaterial and how this immateriality could work in a very spiritual way. They could not understand what I was talking about because they believe that Instagram is art. Instagram is not art. Social media is not art. These kids are not artists. I’m sorry, but they’re not.

Why are things on Instagram and social media not art? Simple. It’s not in the context of art. Everything you have to see in context. If the guy is making breakfast and we are all looking at his breakfast, I don’t give a [expletive]. It’s not in the context of art. If you make the same thing in the gallery, it is in the context of art. Context makes all the difference.

Social media has made it so common for people to publicly share their lives and their bodies. What have you learned about what it means for one’s sense of self to do that? For 55 years, I’ve taken my body as object and subject for my work. So my body is not just present as my body but present as a human body. You’re emotionally moved because my body is your body.

You become a symbolic stand-in for human beings. In your day-to-day life, do you see other people as symbolic too? I developed this deep understanding of human nature. I love humans. To me, the most interesting are the ones who are angry, who are difficult, who are constantly unsatisfied. How can I help them to elevate the spirit and change themselves? This is my favorite thing to do. It’s so interesting to see how people are different. I understand energy.

What do you think of my energy? Not bad at all. You’re very pedantic. You’re very clean cut. Good teeth.

Oh. What do you think of my energy?

I think we can go riskier. Risky? I don’t know. Risk just for risk, I’m not interested. If you create something artificial, it’s not good. People are so afraid of simplicity, but it works.

I’ll ask simpler questions. Who loves you? This is like a Zen question. You are very tricky. Who loves me? This is not important. It’s that I can love. It’s not about some absent love coming to me. Most important is how to generate unconditional love, because love, if it’s conditional, is temporary. It comes and goes, and then it’s all disaster or suffering. But if you have unconditional love, general love for the planet, human beings, the rocks, the trees, everything else, this is the love that nourishes. This is the love I’m interested in. Who loves me? This is up to them, not up to me.

You needed so much love. But when I asked “Who loves you?” you said it’s not who loves you, it’s what you love. You learned that because you didn’t get the love you needed. Exactly. You have to understand that nobody is going to come and help you. That makes you incredibly tough.

You know, I just was reading some Ernst Jünger, and he has a line: “Tell me your relation to pain, and I will tell you who you are!” Wonderful. It is important not to fear pain, to understand pain and accept it. Then pain is much more bearable. Like now, when I was in the hospital, they were giving me opiates every two hours because there was unbearable pain. But I understand if I take this, I will look like a vegetable. So I was taking every two hours, four, then eight and nine, and then finally I didn’t take any. I just deal with pain. But this for a much faster recovery.

But we’re talking about physical pain. Have you learned how to deal with emotional pain? No. Honestly, give me any type of physical pain. Emotional? Wow. This is the most difficult. The thing about emotional pain, just feel it. I’m totally against having medication. Medication, I hate. You have to feel it. That’s all we can do. You ever have love pain?

Of course. It’s hell on earth, huh?

Yeah. Anybody told you differently is lying. People say, “Oh, no, I can deal with this.” That means they never feel love.

A still from Abramovic‘s “Seven Deaths” (2021). From the Marina Abramovic Archives

In that book you say, “I want to understand where my work comes from.” Do that book’s explanations feel satisfying? It makes your motivation all seem very one plus one equals two. It’s very simplified, it’s true. But at the same time I find incredible lessons in looking back. My upbringing made me who I am. This kind of concentration, willpower. Honestly, young artists are so spoiled. I learned to be tough.

Why do you think young artists are spoiled? Because when you come and say “I want to be rich and famous” — oh, my God, they can immediately leave my house. It’s about work. It’s not about immediate recognition. It takes years of good work in order to come somewhere. Lots of them want fast recognition. Just think of Basquiat. I’m not saying that he’s spoiled. He produced enormous amounts of work, he was such an amazing talent, but the exposure — when artists get recognition very fast and very young, you don’t know how to handle. You die young or you overdose or whatever. You’re not used to recognition. I don’t have this problem. I got it at 70.

But I wonder if this connects to what I was asking before about whether you see people as symbolic. Maybe that came back to bite you. I don’t think so. We went to the tribes to live for a long period of time, and it was the most profound experience I had.

In your memoir you also write about having premonitions. Do you still have them? There is something that I believe: When you’re in balance with yourself and your surroundings, everything happens that’s supposed to happen. You think of somebody: Somebody appears in front of your door. A phone call comes, and the first sentence is the answer to something you’re thinking. You never have this in your life?

I think they’re coincidences. No. Because there are moments when you’re in complete balance with energy, outside and inside, and when it happens this is the phenomenon. Monks or people who live in much longer states of meditation, that’s their normal way of life. Long durational performance actually developed these abilities. Because in the long durational, you don’t pretend. You aren’t playing somebody else. You become totally connected with the knowledge you are receiving from everywhere that is available but we are not used to. It’s called “suchness,” which means emptiness but emptiness full of meaning. It’s a contradiction. If we could live like this, it would be a dream.

Are you one of the wow artists? I would never say that for myself, my dear. This, history has to tell.

An American Puzzle: Fitting Race in a Box Census categories for race and ethnicity have shaped how the nation sees itself. Here’s how they have changed over the last 230 years.

Since 1790, the decennial census has played a crucial role in creating and reshaping the ever-changing views of racial and ethnic identity in the United States.

Over the centuries, the census has evolved from one that specified broad categories — primarily “free white” people and “slaves” — to one that attempts to encapsulate the country’s increasingly complex demographics. The latest adaptation proposed by the Biden administration in January seeks to allow even more race and ethnicity options for people to describe themselves than the 2020 census did.

If approved, the proposed overhaul would most likely be adopted across all surveys in the country about health, education and the economy. Here’s what the next census could look like.

The country has grown more multiracial, and federal officials now want to capture that complexity. One of the biggest changes would be to combine race and ethnicity into a single question. Sample of the proposed census form, with “What is your race and ethnicity?” circled in red to highlight it. “Hispanic or Latino” would be one of seven race and/or ethnicity options, rather than in a separate origin question, as it is now. Sample of the proposed census form, with the new “Hispanic or Latino” option circled in red. The change would also add a check box for “Middle Eastern or North African,” and remove people of this heritage from the “white” definition. Sample of the proposed census form, with the new “Middle Eastern or North African” option circled in red.

In some ways, the government is attempting to catch up with modern views of racial and ethnic identities.

There are complicated politics at work too, and the proposed changes have provoked criticism among some scholars and activists.

Many Hispanic or Latino U.S. residents mark “some other race,” typically because they don’t see themselves as “Black” or “white.” Supporters of the proposal say the changes reflect that Latinos have long been treated as a distinct racial group in the United States. But Afro-Latino scholars argue that the new method would mask important racial differences among Latinos.

Community leaders have been advocating for a “Middle Eastern or North African” category for years, pointing to the need for better data for this growing population, especially around health care, education and political representation. If the proposal is approved, this would be the first time since the 1970s that a completely new racial or ethnic category is added to the census.

A precise, universally accepted distinction between race and ethnicity does not exist. Instead, there’s a murky history of law, politics and culture around racial identity in America.

“There is no such thing as a perfect question,” said Roberto Ramirez, a population statistics expert at the U.S. Census Bureau. The bureau has conducted numerous tests in recent decades to improve the census so that people can more accurately identify themselves, he said.

If approved, the new race and ethnicity formulation will have wide-ranging impacts. Any organization receiving federal funding — down to local schools — would have to adhere to it. Race data informs how resources are distributed; whether equal employment policies and anti-discrimination laws can be enforced; and how congressional districts are drawn.

Ever since the census began measuring the U.S. population, race has been central to the counting. The census is more than a bureaucratic exercise; it embodies the country’s continued efforts to neatly categorize inherently nuanced and layered identities. Terms that are now widely viewed as outdated or even offensive had their place on the official forms for decades.

Here’s a copy of the first census in 1790. Two pages from the first census in 1790. Handwritten names and numbers are shown in a table format. It separated free “white” people from other free people and enslaved people. Closer look at one of the pages from the 1790 census, with the race categories circled in red. In 1850, the term “color” was used for “race,” and “mulatto” was introduced to track people with any trace of African blood. Section of the 1850 census form, with printed type and some parts filled in by hand. Race categories are circled in red. In 1870, the census added a “Chinese” category as anxieties over immigration from China rose. Copy of the 1870 census, with the race categories circled in red. In 1890, the census identified African Americans by the fraction of their African ancestry: “Black,” “mulatto,” “quadroon” and “octoroon.” Copy of the 1890 census, with the race categories circled in red. “Mexican” was listed as its own race in 1930, only to be removed the next decade. Copy of the 1930 census, with the race categories circled in red. It was in the year 1970 that people were first allowed to choose their race, rather than having a census taker do so. This made the census a marker of self-identification instead of an outsider’s perception. Copy of a page from the 1970 census, which now takes the form of a multiple-choice questionnaire. That same year, a new question was added to assess the size of the Hispanic population. Mexican, Puerto Rican and Cuban advocates had pressed for the addition for years, arguing that a full accounting of the population was needed to ensure civil rights protections. Close-up of a page from the 1970 census, with the question “Is this person’s origin or descent – ” circled in red. In 1997, the U.S. government set race and ethnicity standards, which were applied to the 2000 census and have largely remained in place. Section of the 2000 census, which asks that people answer both of two questions: “Is this person Spanish/Hispanic/Latino?” and “What is this person’s race? Mark X one or more races.”

The reality of categorizing people with distinct labels has never been simple.

People with identical lineage may choose different boxes, and the same person may choose different boxes in different years. Former President Barack Obama, the son of a white woman from Kansas and a Black man from Kenya, for example, marked himself as “Black,” even when checking more than one race was an option.

Historically, some edits to census race boxes reflected changes in policy or public sentiment. As the nation’s laws on slavery shifted, the census began phasing out the counting of enslaved people and instead introduced new terms to define the Black population.

Other changes were from a push and pull between how the government saw individuals and how they wanted to self-identify. Despite being banished from common use, the term “Negro,” for example, was used in nine decennial censuses until 2010. The term was dropped by the next census.

With 24 decennial censuses so far, race options have changed more than a dozen times, as new groups have been added and others deleted.

“It’s like the census is adjusting the dials on your camera and you get different pictures accordingly,” said Naomi Mezey, a law professor at Georgetown University and the author of “Erasure and Recognition: The Census, Race and the National Imagination.” “It has huge and profound cultural consequences.”

Most recently, the census forms have become the most reliable path to becoming visible — a way to have respondents’ identity, or at least something close to it, documented.

How the Counting Started

Charting the changes in the census over the last two centuries shows the country’s continued struggles over racism, nativism and xenophobia. The census performs dual, and, at times, conflicting purposes: keeping close count of those who deviate from the majority and also recognizing the way people perceive their own racial and ethnic identities.

The 1790 census did not explicitly specify the race of Black people or even acknowledge Native Americans.

The census counted each enslaved worker as three-fifths of a person, reflecting a compromise that granted enslavers more political representation.

But that very first count, with its emphasis on separating enslaved people from free people, paved the way for the census to rely on race as a way to define groups of U.S. residents.

From slavery to racial segregation policies, and through the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s to now, the Black population has been identified by 10 distinct terms.

“Mulatto,” introduced in 1850, was the first term to define a multiracial person. It was removed in 1930 when the census began simply classifying anyone with even one Black ancestor as “Negro.” “Black or African American” eventually replaced “Negro.”

Native Americans were not officially represented in the earliest censuses because most lived under separate sovereignty according to treaties. Beginning in 1860, census takers were instructed to include “Indians,” but only those who renounced tribal affiliation.

It wasn’t until 1890 that the Census Bureau began to count all Native Americans, even those who lived on reservations.

After Alaska was admitted into the United States in 1959, census categories also included “Aleut” and “Eskimo,” which many now consider a slur and was later changed to “Alaska Native.”

Tracking of Immigrants

Anxiety over immigration heightened in the middle of the 19th century, when immigrants from China came as railroad workers. In 1870, the census added a Chinese category.

The Chinese Exclusion Act, passed in 1882, suspended immigration from China. The Immigration Act of 1924 limited the number of immigrants allowed into the United States through a quota based on national origins. The quota was set based on numbers from the 1890 census.

As more immigrants arrived from countries including Japan and Korea, the census grouped them all together, creating a broad Asian American identity.

“The census helped make a ‘race’ out of what had previously been thought of mainly as a nationality,” Ms. Mezey wrote in her paper, referring to people with roots in countries throughout Asia.

Other Asian groups were introduced, removed and then reinstated over the decades, as their populations ebbed and flowed.

After Hawaii became the 50th state in 1959, various categories for Pacific Islanders were added to the census. In 1990, they were put together under a broad group — “Asian or Pacific Islander.”

Similarly, the census also eventually helped popularize the idea of a panethnic “Hispanic or Latino” identity, which included both recent immigrants and native-born citizens who traced their roots to countries from Mexico to Panama to Chile.

Mexicans were the first group of Hispanics to be enumerated. To capture the increase in immigrants after the Mexican Revolution, which ended in 1920, the census had a distinct category for Mexicans in 1930 for the first and only time. But many Mexican Americans fought for the category’s removal in the next census because they sought to be counted as white to gain citizenship.

During the civil rights movement in the late 1960s, Mexicans in the Southwest, Puerto Ricans in the Northeast and Cubans in Florida banded together to urge the federal administration to count the fast-growing Hispanic population. Federal officials said it would be too difficult to add a new category to the short form that enumerated race. So in 1970, they instead created a separate question asking the person’s origin or descent on the longer version of the forms.

But the categories created have struggled to fully capture or accurately describe how people really identify. For example, “Latino” was added in 2000 to the category in part because many people with roots in Latin America did not identify with the term Hispanic.

Confusion also persisted about the distinction between race and ethnicity, with a steadily increasing number of people who identified with being of “Hispanic, Latino or Spanish” origin choosing the “other” category in the race question. In 2020, “some other race” was the second largest race group measured by the census, with Latinos making up a vast majority of those who did not see themselves in any other race option, including Black, white or Asian.

“There are significant numbers of people now who don’t perceive themselves as fitting into the existing categories,” said Jeffrey S. Passel, a senior demographer with Pew Research Center. “The Census Bureau, ever since they added the Hispanic origin question to the census, has been grappling with how to get Hispanics to tick one of the conventional race categories.”

In the latest proposal, “Hispanic or Latino” would be included in a more broadly defined racial and ethnic category, and people would have the option to choose one or more additional categories as well. Proponents believe the change will drastically decrease the number of people who identify only as “some other race.” But some opponents say there have not been enough tests to assure that the changes will not lead to an undercount of Black Latinos. They worry, for example, that a Black Dominican would mark only Hispanic and not Black.

Seeking New Recognition

The Biden administration’s proposal also seeks to add a box for people with Middle Eastern and North African, or MENA, roots. It is the government’s latest attempt to count a group that has long been invisible on the census. A 2015 study by the Census Bureau showed that when given a “Middle Eastern and North African” option, people of that heritage overwhelmingly chose that over “white.”

Historically, the United States has often counted the group in the “white” category because of a decades-old federal directive that defined it that way. In the early 1900s, Arab immigrants had pushed to be classified as “white” to circumvent rules that allowed only white immigrants to become U.S. citizens.

But as that population has increased in the United States, more have pressed for recognition. The number of Middle Eastern and North African residents in the United States has grown to nearly four million in the last decade, as shown in the chart below.

Change in MENA population in the U.S. 2 million 4 million 2010 2015 2020 Source: American Community Survey Note: MENA population includes those with Afghan, Algerian, Arab, Armenian, Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac, Egyptian, Georgian, Iranian, Iraqi, Israeli, Jordanian, Kurdish, Kuwaiti, Lebanese, Libyan, Middle Eastern, Moroccan, North African, Palestinian, Saudi Arabian, Somali, Sudanese, Syrian, Turkish or Yemeni ancestry.

The Biden administration’s Office of Management and Budget has solicited feedback on its proposal, which it could implement and add to all federal forms as early as next summer, and then be used for the 2030 census. With the change, the number of people counted simply as “white” is likely to decline, because of the high numbers of MENA and Hispanic residents who have been marked as white.

Even as the current proposal is still being debated, there are more potential changes already being discussed. Some are pushing for the government to expand gender beyond male and female options. Other activists are asking to create a “Black” subcategory called “American Descendent of Slavery,” as part of a push for reparations.

“There is so much conversation now around descendants of slavery and the need to really deal with the legacy of slavery head on,” said Evan Shepard, a spokesman for the American Descendants of Slavery Advocacy Foundation. “This is a small step in that direction.”

No matter what the solution is for 2030, the forms are almost certain to change again."
867,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/magazine/canada-wildfires.html,"Canada has always burned. But how much? Pyne, the fire historian, says he used to anchor his understanding of modern Canadian fire with the 2003 season in British Columbia, “which at the time seemed apocalyptic.” But more area has burned in the province in four of the last seven years — as it did in 2010 and 2014 and 2015 as well. “We’re riding the tiger at this point,” he says. This year, the total in British Columbia is 11 times as large as it was in 2003, and 200 times as large as it was in 2020.

In the United States, in recent years, fire scientists and forest ecologists have emphasized the complex human drivers of records like these — that beyond the effects of warming, the American West is dealing with a century of aggressive fire suppression and poor forest management, which together have produced a flame-prone landscape stretching across nearly half the continent and simply waiting to burn. The just-so story substitutes one morality tale for another: fire as comeuppance not only for profligate and irresponsible use of fossil fuels but also for reckless and counterproductive use of the continent’s “natural” landscape. But it is hopeful, too: If policy is to blame for the terrifying risk of out-of-control fire, in theory policy should be able to make it at least somewhat less terrifying too.

This is what the Canadian fire scientist Mike Flannigan calls “the American narrative,” and though some colleagues north of the border have “drank the Kool-Aid,” too, he says, it does not so neatly apply across Canada’s diverse forest ecosystems — especially not the boreal, which has been subject to much less human intervention and which he describes as a cleaner case study on global warming and fire weather. Instead, he emphasizes what might be called the power law of wildfire spread. In Canada, 3 percent of fires cause 97 percent of the damage. Most fires are not hard to put out if you want to extinguish them and don’t spread very fast if you don’t. But on extreme “spread days,” the window for direct attack can be as short as 15 minutes, Flannigan says, and “if you miss that window, your cake is baked, the horse has left the barn, you’re out of luck.” And if a year with three or four truly dangerous days is followed by one with 10 or 15, the effect on total area burned can be not additive but multiplicative, with relatively small changes to patterns of extreme weather yielding world-changing volumes of fire. Across Canada, the fire season has grown by several weeks in recent decades.

Globally, the fire story is less exponential, with declines in burned area in sub-Saharan Africa mostly offsetting rapid fire growth in the major midlatitude hot spots, with the global trend in fire emissions, as a result, mostly flat. But in those major hot spots — western Canada and the western United States, Russian Siberia and Australia, which is now gearing up for what may be a catastrophic bush-fire season — the decades-long trends are clear: up everywhere.

Nearly everyone staring down the wicked problem of living with 21st-century fire offers a similar list of interventions. For the forest ecologist Rachel Holt, it starts with better forest policy, focused on a transformation of the timber industry and the restoration of more resilient landscapes, a more honest accounting of carbon emissions from logging and a more nuanced approach to fire management, including the cultivation of more good fire through controlled burning. “When there’s a raging wildfire, it seems futile, but you have to start local,” Holt says. If we manage the forest around my little town, well, maybe we can stop my little town from burning down,” she says. “Like all things climate-related, we have a massive problem, and there isn’t a quick way. There isn’t an easy solution. We have to get climate change in hand — now, in fact, yesterday. And if we don’t, it’s all a game.” She goes on: “It doesn’t matter what we do in the forest, things are going to burn. We’re going to pass every tipping point there’s ever been. And we’re hooped.”"
868,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/10/20/opinion/trump-voters-gop-focus-group.html,"There may still be a contest for the Republican presidential nomination underway — the Iowa caucuses aren’t until Jan. 15 — but to say it is Donald Trump’s to lose is an understatement. For many if not most Republican primary voters, Mr. Trump is the equivalent of an incumbent president (and to some, he still is president). Incumbents generally get renominated with ease. But are there ways for another candidate to give him a real race?

For our focus group with 11 Republican primary voters, we wanted to hear from people who are leaning toward Mr. Trump but who said they were open to voting for another candidate. We wanted to try to better understand the former president’s strengths in this race and where he might be vulnerable. Several members of the group had positive things to say about Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley and some of the other candidates. But the group was most revealing about how, even as they were somewhat ambivalent about aspects of Mr. Trump’s conduct and record, there was a deep bond with him and with his style of leadership. These Republicans are drawn to the idea of disruptive leaders who shake up the system (a couple of them quite liked Robert F. Kennedy Jr.), and several of them favored following gut instinct and upsetting people from time to time as leadership traits.

So far, the other Republican candidates for president aren’t breaking through. They’re failing to give these voters reasons to pass on Mr. Trump’s candidacy. The other candidates’ collective strategy thus far of taking some swipes at Mr. Trump while making cases for themselves hasn’t been enough against a recent former president. And how do you attack and beat Mr. Trump when so few Republicans — including these 11 — want to see Mr. Trump attacked? The group made some suggestions for how to appeal to them and called out dimensions of Mr. Trump that they don’t like. Most of all, it came down to appealing to voters’ heads over their hearts: making a powerful, memorable, sustained case for why it was time to move on from Mr. Trump, a man they still have great affection for."

From New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.” [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, it is Ezra. So we are working on a bunch of other episodes about Israel-Palestine. And we also have some great shows that were recorded that were supposed to come out with. My book leave had lasted as long as I’d intended for it to last on some other topics. And we’re going to be releasing those as events warrant. So this one felt important to do right now. It’s between my colleague, Carlos Lozada, And McKay Coppins on Mitt Romney. McKay, of course, wrote the big new buzzy Romney book that is out. I think it shines some important light on what the Republican Party has become and what that has meant for people who just a couple of election cycles ago were literally the Republican Party’s leaders. Watching Romney closely, and seeing what has happened to him, and then where he has moved in response, I think is a really interesting way to understand actually how far the Republican Party has shifted, even though it is still called the same thing. So I think there’s a lot of insight here, and I hope you enjoy it.

It’s a weirdly fitting moment to examine the life of Mitt Romney. Romney has been a governor and a US Senator as a member of the Republican Party. He was even the party’s presidential nominee. And yet, what he may be most remembered for is the moment when he broke with the G.O.P. In February of 2020, Romney voted to convict Donald Trump in his impeachment trial on the charge of abusing his power by attempting to persuade Ukraine’s government to investigate the Biden family. In that moment, Romney became the first senator in U.S. history to vote to remove a president of his own party from office. McKay Coppins, a staff writer at The Atlantic, goes deep on that decision and many others Romney has faced in his new book, “Romney: A Reckoning.” The book is in part the product of dozens of personal interviews as well as access to the senator’s private journals, emails and text messages. At a time when the Republican Party took weeks to even choose a House Speaker, and when it seems eager to nominate a twice impeached and four times indicted former President as its standard bearer, Romney’s story feels retro. He’s the consummate institutionalist in an anti-institutionalist party. And yet, what’s fascinating about Coppins’s book, is that the author pushes Romney to wrestle with his own role, even his own complicity in what his party has become. As always, you can email the show with your thoughts and guest recommendations at ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. McKay Coppins, welcome to the show.

mckay coppins

Thanks for having me.

carlos lozada

So I have to read a lot of political memoirs and political biographies by journalists and historians for my job. What I love about this book is that you’ve written a book about the evolution of Mitt Romney, his principled stance, his implicit compromises along the way. But it’s also a book about the evolution of the Republican Party. And there’s some jaw dropping moments here and there that I want you to explain in greater detail. But first, let’s start with some basics. So the book is “Romney: A Reckoning.” But I feel like there’s multiple reckonings going on in the book. What reckonings are you focused on?

mckay coppins

It’s a good point. And I think that subtitle was deliberately sort of multifaceted. Right?

carlos lozada

Perfect. Yes.

mckay coppins

Because the way that this book began was that I had covered Mitt Romney for a while. I had covered his 2012 presidential campaign. I covered his speech at the Republican convention in 2004 when I was a senior in high school. So I could say that I’ve been covering Mitt Romney for almost 20 years, if you go back to my 17 —

carlos lozada

You’ve been covering Mitt before it was uncool. [LAUGHS]

mckay coppins

Yes. Exactly. That’s exactly right. But I had profiled him for “The Atlantic“, and I had kind of stayed in touch with him. And after Jan. 6, I could tell that he was kind of going through something. There was a kind of reckoning happening. He was grappling with difficult questions about what his party had become, what was happening to the country. And I sensed, though he didn’t make this explicit at first, his own role in all of this. Like, whether he had played a role inadvertently in allowing the party to get to this point. And so when I approached him, I basically said, I think you might be in a unique position to be a really interesting subject for a political biography. I only want to do it if you’re ready to fully tell all the stories, be candid, be straightforward, not protect your future re-election or whatever. And he, very luckily for me, sort of took that as a challenge and started giving me his journals and his emails. And, obviously, in the last few years, he was known as this guy who was courageously standing up against Trump and was sort of one of the last remaining bulwarks against the spread of Trumpism and the Republican Party. I knew that was going to be a crucial part of the story. But how he got to that from being kind of known as a cautious, calculating politician was the story I was most interested in at first.

carlos lozada

I want to get into that sense of his personality, that he was this cautious, calculating guy. You have a great description early on of Mitt. You call him a walking amalgam of prep school manners and Mormon niceness and the practiced cool of the private equity set. Right? Which just stuck in my head as like, yeah, that’s Mitt Romney. But you also raised something else that I hadn’t thought about in connection to Romney at all, and that is his anger.

mckay coppins

Mhm.

carlos lozada

Right? There’s More? Than a few moments when you talk about his — this deep well of anger, his temper he has to control. When does that manifest itself and where does it come from?

mckay coppins

That actually was something that I was surprised to learn about. Because the couple moments that we’ve seen him be angry in public are notable for how out of character they seem. Right? One of them is on the Senate floor on Jan. 6, standing behind Josh Hawley as he’s giving this speech, and there’s this kind of famous clip of Mitt Romney sort of glaring at him from behind two masks that he’s wearing. What I learned from talking to him, and from reading his journals, and talking to people around him is that he does have this temper. It was one of the early impediments to his kind of ability to win political debates as a candidate. So when he was running for governor, he would do these mock debates with his advisers —

carlos lozada

Which he hates.

mckay coppins

He hated them because, in part, he had smart advisers like Beth Myers, who in Massachusetts kind of became his right hand, and she realized, I’m going to try to get under his skin in these mock debates and see what happens. And he would get so angry. She would trot out these attack lines. One time he threw his notes on the floor. Another time he said, well, if that’s what it’s going to be like, there’s no way for me to win. We shouldn’t even bother.

carlos lozada

Wow.

mckay coppins

He would really get kind of angry. And I think part of it comes from his lifetime of privilege and wealth. He grew up in a kind of bubble where he wasn’t challenged that often. He also has sort of a quasi-aristocratic conviction in manners and propriety. And he feels like when his sense of propriety is being violated by somebody else, it really makes him mad.

carlos lozada

There’s like an indignation to it. Right?

mckay coppins

Yeah, an indignation. And that’s kind of what was interesting about him as a character, is that he has this righteous indignation, but he can also be kind of judgmental of people and lose his temper. And it doesn’t always manifest in a flattering way.

carlos lozada

You had an enormous degree of access to Romney, just like his trove of emails. Those private journals are amazing. Right? Why do you think he was ready to do this? And why do you think he was ready to do this with you?

mckay coppins

I think it was a couple things. I think he realized he was at the twilight of his career. Right? For so much of his political career, he was focused on becoming president one day. Right? And he now knows that’s never going to happen. So that’s part of it, being freed from the constraints of trying to become president. That matters. He also was increasingly isolated in Washington and alienated from his party. Something I learned about Mitt Romney is he really is a team guy, like naturally. He wants to be part of a team. He cultivated this close inner circle of advisers that stayed with him for decades. He’s a partisan in the sense that he wants to pick a side and then be with that side, in some ways. But he just couldn’t get on board with the Donald Trump era of the Republican Party. And because of that, felt increasingly isolated. And was therefore not buffeted by the machinery of partisan politics that —

carlos lozada

Which would preclude you from —

mckay coppins

That would prevent him from telling me these stories. Right? He didn’t really care what Lindsey Graham told him in the caucus meetings or if Josh Hawley would get mad at him. Like, he is — I think that was part of it. But I will also say, it’s not like he kind of arrived as a subject fully ready to go this far. It was a two year conversation, over 50 interviews, that took sometimes me just kind of patiently listening, sometimes me needling him a little bit, challenging him. He also, to his credit, put in a lot of time considering and reconsidering questions that I asked. Sometimes he would come back to me a week later and say, eh, you know, you asked me this last week, I don’t think I fully answered you. And he’d have kind of more thoughts. But the other thing that’s happened is that Mitt Romney, I write about this throughout the book, is a person who has had a very keen sense of his own mortality for a long time. And this goes back to a car crash that he was involved in as a Mormon missionary as a young man. But especially I think now, he’s convinced that he only has at most 12 years left. And I don’t — I mean, sometimes these conversations would take morbid turns where I really didn’t know how to respond, but the men in his family have a history of sudden heart failure. His father is the one who lived the longest of any of them, and he died at 88. So he’s convinced he has at most 12 years left. But he’s thinking more about how he’ll be remembered and less about how whatever he’ll do will play in the next day’s news cycle.

carlos lozada

You use this term a few times, the Romney obligation. What is that?

mckay coppins

Mitt Romney has this kind of story that he tells about his family, which is that the Romneys have this kind of overdeveloped outsized sense of obligation to run toward a crisis and to try to solve the problem, that when they’re called upon — or not even if they’re not called upon — but when there is a crisis that needs to be addressed, they feel like they need to be there and be in the middle of the action, even when it’s risky and even when it’s unpleasant. And he saw this in his father. He has stories going back through his genealogy of various forefathers who also had this. And he feels a strong sense of obligation, which has manifested in various ways throughout his career. I mean, one of the most obvious is his takeover of the Olympics in Salt Lake City. Right? At this time, was on pace to become a billionaire. Instead is convinced by his wife, Ann, and a couple of other friends that the Olympic games in Salt Lake City were in crisis. There had been kind of scandals around financial mismanagement and bribery allegations. And, you know, advertisers were fleeing. And he decided, well, like, somebody needs to turn this around. It needs to be me. And he walked away from really a lot of money. He could have made a lot more money.

carlos lozada

He had money. [LAUGHS]

mckay coppins

Yeah. And that was kind of the argument that Ann made to him. What do we need more money for? We have all the money we could possibly want? And he went and took this kind of thankless job that ended up propelling him to the Massachusetts governorship. But one of the most revealing things I found in research about this period was a quote that Ann Romney gave the Boston Globe at that time, which is, somebody asked, why is your husband doing, this moving across the country to Utah to take over these games? And she said, he loves emergencies and catastrophes.

carlos lozada

Wow.

mckay coppins

Which I asked him about and he kind of admitted that on the one hand, there’s this strong sense of obligation, on the other hand, he also has an adrenaline rush when there is a high stakes problem to be solved that he can’t really get anywhere else.

carlos lozada

You mentioned his father. You dedicate a lot of time to George Romney, who seems by far to be the biggest sort of influence looming over Mitt’s life. And often, it’s this kind of inspirational presence. But in some ways, it also felt like a little reproachful, like Mitt is aware of the moments when he’s not living up to George’s legacy. How does George loom over Mitt? The way I think about it, as I’ve spent time with him, and George comes up all the time in our conversations, in his journals — All the time in the book. It’s amazing.

mckay coppins

I mean, it really — I put a lot of George in there. I could put a lot more. I mean, there’s a version of this book that it’s like a biography of the two of them, because they’re so LinkedIn, in Mitt’s mind at least. The way I think about it is that he’s both inspired by and at times haunted by his dad’s legacy. His father was a pioneering auto executive, then became governor of Michigan. Was then seen as the likely next Republican nominee for president and happened to be running at a time when the Republican Party was taking its rightward turn, where you had Richard Nixon’s campaign running the Southern strategy. White grievance became an incredibly important part of the new and emerging Republican coalition. But what makes George Romney so admirable is that he kind of emphatically stood against the rising tide of racism and white grievance and refused to indulge it. And, in fact, pushed back against it in ways that were pretty politically damaging to him. He refused to condemn the people who took part in the race riots in Detroit, while running as a Republican presidential candidate, and instead delivered an address about how we need to look at the root causes of these riots, and white America needs to look within itself. And he launched his campaign with a tour of the American ghettos, speaking to the inner cities, posing with left wing radicals, arguing that we can find common ground. His campaign ended up melting down though because of one interview that he gave — a radio interview — in which he was asked about his changing position on the Vietnam War. And George said that, I went over to Vietnam with a group of other governors, and the generals brainwashed me. And what he was trying to say is, basically, the American military and the State Department were selling us a false story.

carlos lozada

They were spinning it.

mckay coppins

And we got spun. And now I’ve realized that I got spun, and I’ve changed my attitude, and now I’m against the Vietnam War. But that use of the word brainwashing became a massive story. George’s campaign was actually already on the way down, but it was more the final nail in the coffin. But it was emblematic of George’s problem as a politician, but also his most admirable trait, which is that he just sort of recklessly said what he believed. And what Mitt took away from that is both, my dad was a hero and the embodiment of integrity in politics, and I wish that I could be like my dad, but also the way to get elected president is to do the exact opposite.

carlos lozada

George was great, but he blew it.

mckay coppins

But he blew it. And so what Mitt took away, and he really internalized this lesson and made sure everyone in his campaigns did too, was, we have to be hyper disciplined. We have to stick to the talking points. We have to follow where our party’s base is. And we’re not going to try to heroically change the mind of Republican primary voters. We’re going to do what’s necessary to win. He took this so seriously that when he first ran for president in 2008, he pulled a thesis — I believe it was a BYU master’s thesis — but somebody who had basically written about why George’s presidential campaign failed — printed it out and had all of his senior advisers read it.

carlos lozada

That was an amazing moment. I couldn’t believe he had done that.

mckay coppins

But it shows how much George kind of loomed over Mitt Romney throughout his career.

carlos lozada

Yeah here it says, the title of the 88 page paper was “George Romney in 1968: From Front Runner to Dropout, Analysis of Cause.” I mean, imagine everyone on the staff getting this 88 page master’s thesis —

mckay coppins

From 1960 —

carlos lozada

Here’s why my dad lost, and let’s not do that.

mckay coppins

Right. But it’s just important to understand, because for most of his career he essentially defined his approach to politics in opposition to his father. And really, I think the way he sees his turn during the Trump era, is a chance to finally reach for his father’s legacy and live up to it.

carlos lozada

Of course, the difference, the major overwhelming difference, is that his father did that when the stakes were the highest, when he was running for president. And that’s something that Mitt didn’t do when the stakes were the highest.

mckay coppins

And you know, it’s funny, I think that haunts him a little bit. And this was one of those things where I was always kind of pressing him to think harder about.

carlos lozada

You can tell. You can tell in the book that he — and he goes back and forth a lot.

mckay coppins

He does. Some weeks in our weekly interviews he would seem like he was kind of confessing complicity and the parties capture by these kind of extremist forces by indulging them or not standing up against them. But then another week he would be like, yeah, but I think that might be too far. And he resisted for a long time. I mean, there’s one important moment that I think listeners to this podcast will think about, which is Mitt Romney accepted Donald Trump’s endorsement in 2012 when he was running in the Republican primary. They stood on a stage together in Las Vegas. Had a whole event built around it. And this was when Donald Trump was becoming a right wing political celebrity with this kind of conspiracy theory about Barack Obama not being American.

carlos lozada

I want to come back to that moment. I love what he says in the moment when he’s up there with Trump.

mitt romney There are some things that you just can’t imagine happening in your life. This is one of them. Being in —

carlos lozada

I love kind of witnessing other people’s awkwardness in real time. And that was just one of the most awkward moments in American politics in recent years. How did Romney rationalize that moment?

mckay coppins

Yeah. So he, first of all, convinced himself that if Trump didn’t endorse him, he’d endorse somebody else. And it’s better for the party, better for the country, if he wins instead of Newt Gingrich or Rick Perry.

carlos lozada

God, he hated Newt.

mckay coppins

Some of the meanest quotes, not just in the book but that I’ve ever seen one politician say about another, are about Newt Gingrich. If that’s a plug for future readers, go ahead. No, but he saw himself as running against kind of a clown car of lesser Republicans and felt like he needed to win, which is a very common rationalization in politics. He also believed that Donald Trump was not a serious political figure.

carlos lozada

Right.

mckay coppins

Right? If Bill Maher and Kanye West can donate to and endorse Barack Obama, why can’t I have “The Apprentice” host? Who cares, right? But the other kind of interesting wrinkle to this is that as he spent time with Trump, at fund-raisers and stuff throughout that campaign, he actually kind of liked Trump.

carlos lozada

You said that. He sort of enjoyed having him around.

mckay coppins

He enjoyed the company. He still thought of him as a buffoon and he didn’t take him seriously as like a businessman or anything like that, and he thought his conspiracy theories were insane. They have this kind of — there’s this one scene where Mitt tries to very patiently and logically talk Donald Trump out of the birther conspiracy theory. He’s like, no, no, no, what you don’t understand about constitutional law is — and quickly realizes that Trump has completely zoned out. And he’s like, all right, never mind. But in terms of just Trump as like one on one, guy who would call him sometimes on the campaign trail, it was fun. And I found this journal entry from 2012 where he kind of — Mitt kind of rhapsodizes about hanging out with Trump, and says, they just don’t make them like Donald Trump anymore. And he says he’s entertaining and lifts my spirits on the campaign trail, or whatever, which I think — when I brought it up with him, I could tell he was kind of chagrined by it, but he also said, this does speak though, to how Trump has gotten as far as he did with the party. You get in the room with him and he’s fun to hang out with, and he’s charismatic and gossipy. And he seduces people.

carlos lozada

It also proves he didn’t take him that seriously though.

mckay coppins

But that’s the thing, he didn’t think of him as like certainly anyone who would run for president. He just didn’t — he thought he was like a —

carlos lozada

He’s a gadfly.

mckay coppins

Yeah, he’s a gadfly. That’s how he rationalized it. This was, though, one of those things that I think even now, as he went through this whole kind of reckoning process, we still, I think, somewhat disagree on where he landed. Because as much as he’s embarrassed by it in retrospect, and as much as he wishes he could take it back, he just fundamentally doesn’t believe that accepting Trump’s endorsement and kind of welcoming him into the campaign in 2012 had that much effect on Trump’s ultimate rise to power.

carlos lozada

Do you think it did?

mckay coppins

I think it’s hard to say, but I think there’s more of a case than Romney will acknowledge. I think that standing on that stage with him and making him part of the Republican campaign apparatus in 2012 introduced him to a lot of people in the party. And I think just gave him a little credibility. I think Romney has a plausible case that he ended up winning in this like riding this crazy once in a generation populist wave. And maybe that’s true. But Romney won’t fully say, I am responsible for Trump’s rise. [MUSIC PLAYING]

carlos lozada

There’s an idea that comes up a lot in the book. It’s rationalization. And you see it throughout Mitt’s life in different key moments, especially in the political realm. When did you first begin to understand that that would be a real theme of this book?

mckay coppins

It’s interesting, because I both saw him doing it in real time and also listened to him discuss his own impulse to rationalize. And so it became clear to me pretty early on that it would be an important theme of the book. It was also, frankly, part of what made the book timely and interesting to me. Because I think we are at this moment in American politics that we would not have gotten to if not for hundreds of, maybe thousands of, people rationalizing things that were in their self-interest. So to answer the question more directly, Mitt, I had heard him tell student groups or his staff, if there’s one piece of advice I can give you now, with all this hindsight that I have the benefit of now, it would be, don’t sacrifice your principles at the altar of ambition. It’s not worth it.

carlos lozada

There’s a lot of this like, believe me, I know it’s not worth it. Kind of like there’s an acknowledgment that that’s something he did.

mckay coppins

Absolutely. And in fact, that was one of the early conversations we had. I asked him, I’ve heard you say this a bunch of times. Can you give me some examples of when you did rationalize something in your own self-interest or sacrifice your principles? And that became the beginning of a long running conversation that kind of ran over the next two years. Because he started with — he had some immediate ones that came to mind. And not all of them are, I acted more right wing than I was. In fact, when he was running for Senate in Massachusetts and in for governor of Massachusetts, he told me, I pretended to be pro-choice when I really wasn’t. Right? And he walked me through in kind of fascinating detail how he rationalized the position that he took. He dug into Mormon discourses on the issue and looked for loopholes that he could find, and really convinced himself that this was an OK position to take. But then later, there were a bunch of times when he was running for president where he acted like he had these right-wing positions that he really didn’t. And part of it, for him, was that he is not somebody who actually — I think. He disagrees with me slightly on this. But I write in the book that he’s not somebody who places a high premium on unwavering dedication to certain policy positions. Like, he thinks that on most issues there are a range of reasonable positions and what really matters is the execution. And I think implicit to that is, if it helps me get closer to the White House taking one position over another, what’s wrong with that?

carlos lozada

Very pragmatist.

mckay coppins

And I think that’s part of why he was always tagged with this like flip flopper attack. Because he ultimately, just that’s not — he’s not an ideologue. He doesn’t have a firm set of policy positions.

carlos lozada

I remember Ann Romney’s convention speech, when it wasn’t about his beliefs as much as like, no one will work harder than Mitt Romney. You know?

mckay coppins

Right.

carlos lozada

It was basically saying, he’s just going to outwork everyone. Because that’s the kind of guy he is. So what kind of Republican was he? And then what persona formed, as you put it?

mckay coppins

I think naturally, coming out from where he came from in Michigan and watching his dad, he would have described himself in the early 2000 as probably a moderate, pragmatic, pro-business Republican. Right? Whose forte was budgetary issues, fiscal issues, and stimulating job growth in his state and hopefully in the country. In ‘08, when he started running, he thought of himself as like, I’m going to make the campaign about the things I want it to be about. Right? It was — it had this kind of quaint idea that the presidential campaign should be about the biggest issues that affect Americans. And it’s going to be about what I think is important. And what he very quickly realized on those stages was that that’s not how you win a Republican primary. That’s not how you win a presidential election. You end up having to sell yourself out little by little and reshape your persona. And I don’t think that everything about him as a 2008 presidential candidate was false, but I do think he was responding to crowds. And he kind of positioned himself as the Reaganite right wing even kind of culture warrior, because that was the path for him in that primary race. And it came off as inauthentic. One of the most interesting things that I found in his emails was a long thread among his way too many Republican political consultants who were working on that 2008 presidential campaign, where it was toward the end, it was clear that McCain was going to win. Romney was going to have to drop out sooner. And so it was now like recriminations among the consultants, blaming each other.

carlos lozada

The blame game time, right. Yeah. Yeah.

mckay coppins

This is why the campaign didn’t work. And what was really interesting is there was a contingent of consultants who were saying, we need to do more to position him as the heir to Reagan. He’s claimed the Reaganite conservative mantle. And then Stuart Stevens, who was his longtime adviser, said, the problem with that is that he’s not a movement conservative and people can tell. He comes off as inauthentic when we position him that way. We need to stop doing that. So there was this kind of tug of war between these two sides. I think in 2012, when he decided to run again, he got to run a campaign that was closer to what he wanted it to be about, because economic issues were top of mind. But still, there were all kinds of moments in that campaign that he wishes he could take back.

carlos lozada

There’s a moment, I think it’s in the 2012 campaign, where Romney still thought that this campaign could be about principles and expertise and competence. And Stuart Stevens is like, no, this campaign — where the party is right now, this is about identity and tribalism and grievance. And if we’re going to win, we’re going to have to steal this nomination.

mckay coppins

Yep.

carlos lozada

MCKAY COPPINS: Like that was a remarkable statement. Because I think that there are instances where Romney is still thinking, the budget. He was like, the Tea Party is really about fiscal discipline. You know? I’m like, what? Like, for real? Are you for real? And even Stuart Stevens is like, no, that’s not what this is about at all. And so 2012 felt like that sort of hinge moment where Mitt didn’t quite understand, or didn’t want to understand, what the party was becoming. People say that it’s remarkable that after Barack Obama the country liked Donald Trump. I think it’s even more remarkable that after Mitt Romney the Republican Party nominated Donald Trump. That transformation —

mckay coppins

The most polar opposite kinds of candidates. Right? With polar opposite worldviews in a lot of ways.

carlos lozada

Yeah. And the same party —

mckay coppins

And the same party and a lot of the same vote — I mean, obviously, most of the same voters. That idea that — I titled that chapter Heist. Because that really was — Mitt Romney’s campaign’s approach to the 2012 primaries was, the only way we win is by stealing this from voters who really don’t like Mitt Romney. He’s a Mormon in an overwhelmingly kind of evangelical primary base. He’s a Massachusetts moderate in a very conservative party. And the only way we’re going to escape here is sort of through redirection, and a misdirection, and trying to take voters’ minds off his various deficits. And he ended up pulling it off. He won the nomination by the skin of his teeth. But in the process, I think, did so much damage to himself that it was hard to then win in the general election against Barack Obama.

carlos lozada

Why do you think he wanted to be president? Is it just the Romney obligation? Just like, I’m the guy who can fix things. There’s a great scene when he’s mad at his campaign staffers for not coming up with a message. He’s like, Obama has this whole move forward thing. It makes me look backward. That’s really smart. Where’s my message? You know? I’m like, the message should come from the top, right? Like, don’t you have an idea of why you want to do this?

mckay coppins

He thought of the kind of lofty campaign message as just like another thing you could outsource to your consultants. Right? And the reality is, the reason you’re running needs to come from the candidate. Yes, the consultants can help you dress it up and come up with a slogan, but you need to have the reason. And I think the reason they struggled with that was because, ultimately, his reason for running was that he just thought he was better than everybody else at fixing fiscal issues. And that’s just not like — it’s not a rallying cry. It’s not hope and change. It’s like, put the consultant in charge for four years, he’ll turn things around. But the thing is, that was genuine. It’s interesting, his most active period of journal keeping was in the 2012 campaign. And I think it’s because he thought he had a pretty good shot at becoming president, he wanted to be ready to write a presidential memoir one day if he needed to. And so he kept a very detailed day to day journal, which started out in travelogue form, where it was like, I had these meetings, went to this state, whatever. And then quickly became a medium for venting and catharsis. Like, at the end of a long day —

carlos lozada

Helped you.

mckay coppins

It was great for me. At the end of the day, he would take out his iPad, that’s where he wrote, and just kind write all his frustrations with his primary candidates, and his staff, and Barack Obama. And super interesting stuff there. But you could detect in those journal entries a genuine desire to help people. Part of the campaign apparatus was like they would bring out these people who’s small businesses had been destroyed, or who had lost their homes —

carlos lozada

Yes, I remember that.

mckay coppins

And so he spent basically that whole year meeting with people who were really struggling in the aftermath of the 2008 recession. And he really felt for them. And he knew that he couldn’t really emote in public, because it would come across as phony and he wasn’t that kind of politician. But he did feel for them. And he — this is kind of the difference between people like him and me, frankly, is that he has just this enormous outsized confidence in his own abilities. Like he really believed that he could fix the U.S. economy if he was just given the chance.

carlos lozada

Not only that he could, but he was the only one who could.

mckay coppins

The only one who could. Exactly. exactly.

carlos lozada

I remember I was reading this book and I turned to my wife at one point, I was like, I know why Mitt Romney wanted to be president. He just thought he’d be really good at it. [LAUGHS]

mckay coppins

[LAUGHS] Exactly.

carlos lozada

That was kind of it [MUSIC PLAYING] There’s a moment much earlier in the book that is another one of those jaw dropping moments. He’s talking to a group of evangelical leaders in South Carolina. He’d been kind of realizing that, people think Mormonism is kind of weird, and maybe this is hurting me. And then one of these guys says to him flat out, if you become president, you will normalize Mormonism. And therefore, more people will go to Hell.

mckay coppins

Yes.

carlos lozada

And not go to Hell as a metaphor. He means go to Hell, capital H. And I kept wondering, to what extent did he come to conclude it was a hindrance overall in his political ambitions? But to what extent did it also drive him?

mckay coppins

It’s interesting, for all of the flip flopping he’s accused of and all the kind of disposable policy positions that he’s demonstrated throughout his life, his faith has been nonnegotiable from the beginning. He had advisers in 2007 when he was running for president the first time who said, why don’t you just say, Mormonism is part of my heritage. It’s passed down by my —

carlos lozada

Right? Why don’t you give a speech kind of minimizing it? Right?

mckay coppins

Like why don’t you just say, it’s not really — I’m a Christian, but the Mormons stuff is just kind of part of my family history. And he was like, no way. That’s not happening. Even as he was having these conversations with evangelical power brokers, and ministers, and voters, who were making very clear that for them it was nonnegotiable. Like voting for a Mormon, to them, there was no way. And that 2008 primary was kind of traumatizing for his family. I interviewed all — I talked to all of his sons and his wife, and they have stories about just some of the things people would say to them on the campaign trail in Iowa or South Carolina. It was kind of the first time that they encountered visceral anti-Mormon sentiment from people.

carlos lozada

Because they lived in that community for so long, right?

mckay coppins

Well, they lived in Massachusetts where there’s not a lot of Mormons, but it’s also a pretty progressive inclusive place. I know this because I —

carlos lozada

You grew up there, right?

mckay coppins

— grew up as a Mormon in Massachusetts. And you would get the occasional polygamy joke or whatever, but it was really just, first of all, mostly secular and people just didn’t really care that much about your religion. In places like Iowa and South Carolina, people care a lot about your religion. And on the one hand, he wasn’t going to disavow his religion. But he also had to keep seeking the endorsements and votes of these people who manifestly hated his religion. And it’s a strange kind of indignity of politics that I think a lot of candidates are called upon to endure. I mean, I think of Barack Obama certainly campaigning in 2008. In a country as diverse and pluralistic as ours, we ask our candidates to endure a lot. And there’s another scene later in the book where he goes to the Values Voters Summit, and he has to speak right before this guy, Bryan Fisher, who is a raging anti-Muslim, homophobic guy, who’s also said terrible things about Mormons. And Romney finds out that he’s speaking right before him and decides, I need to push back against this rhetoric, and adds a couple lines to his speech pushing back against it. It gets a terrible response in the room. He ends up coming in near last place in the straw poll at the Values Voter Summit. And he writes in his journal afterward, this is my seventh time coming to this summit. Smiling because it’ll be my last. And it kind of gives you a sense of just like how much he hated that part of campaigning.

carlos lozada

And yet, in a generic sense, wouldn’t like Values Voters be Mitt’s people?

mckay coppins

That’s what’s so ironic about all of this. A Mormon Republican is about as values centric as you can have. And he lived a life where he was a father of five, doting husband, never been any controversy or scandal about his personal life, doesn’t drink, doesn’t smoke. Like, he should have been the model candidate for these people, but because of their theological differences, they just couldn’t get past it.

carlos lozada

It’s interesting to me how clearly Romney despises campaigning, throughout the book. He hates Iowa. And then he’s like, what, he has to go back to Iowa again? He’s so miserable. In some ways, he’s such an awkward fit for politics. I remember there’s a great moment early on, which talks about what if scenarios, where he’s in college and he thinks he wants to get a Ph.D. in English literature. He wants to study Steinbeck and Dickens for the rest of his life. And some professor is like, you’ll be so poor. Just go to business school.

mckay coppins

They say, you’ll have plenty of time to read books.

carlos lozada

Yeah. Yeah.

mckay coppins

Go to law school or business school. Choose one of those.

carlos lozada

Then, of course, he went to both.

mckay coppins

Yeah. But I mean, I do think that speaks to Romney, very at home in a conference room, a boardroom, I think would have actually probably enjoyed a life of reading books and teaching. He’s really not at home on the campaign trail. And in fact, he’s now pretty self-aware about it. And there’s a funny moment — I don’t actually think this is in the book — but where he was watching Ron DeSantis campaign early in the current primaries. And he told me, that guy looks like he’s getting ready to go to dental appointment or something. And then he kind of paused and said, kind of reminds me of myself actually.

carlos lozada

Oh, my God.

mckay coppins

He just never liked it. He knows he’s awkward. He can feel himself being awkward. But he also — the other thing is that some of it is people assume a level of inauthenticity that actually isn’t always there. When he ran for governor in Massachusetts, they ran this ad called “Ann” that was about his like teenage romance with Ann and his like doting affection on his wife. And voters hated it. And they pulled it very quickly. Because he came off as like plastic and too perfect and fake. And people were like, there’s no way that’s real. It actually was real. That is what he’s like with Ann. And what he said to me is, I guess I’m the candidate who’s authentically inauthentic. He comes from a long line of wife guys. The Romney men — the Romney men love their wives, performatively, but also authentically.

carlos lozada

Last night, in preparation for this conversation, I watched several old Mitt Romney speeches. And one of the ones I watched was his 2016 speech denouncing Trump. He almost seemed like he was having fun.

mitt romney And let me put it very plainly. If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished. But you say, wait, wait, wait, isn’t he a huge business success? Doesn’t he know what he’s talking about? No, he isn’t. And no, he doesn’t.

ezra klein

He’s got this little smile half the time. He like waits for people to laugh at his one liners. Like sometimes they don’t. Sometimes they do. But he just — he absolutely eviscerates Trump.

mitt romney Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University.

carlos lozada

So given that, how on God’s Good Earth does he take the meeting to become Trump’s Secretary of State? It just seems like such a contrast to everything he’d been doing. He’d been like behind the scenes, machinations, trying to get Cruz and Rubio and Kasich to figure out a plan. I mean, he’d been doing everything he could. He decided this guy was this pernicious force, a con artist, dangerous to the Republic. And then like, whoa, maybe I can go work for him. Like, how did he come around to that process? I see that offer, or kind of the dangling of the Secretary of State job in front of Romney, as the last temptation for Romney. Right? He had taken this defiant stand against Trump, and really reamed out his Republican friends who got on board. Reince Priebus, at one point I write about, goes to Mitt and says, OK, well now that he’s the nominee, can we get you on board? And he laughs in Reince’s face and says, Trump is nuts. Won’t do it so. Then Trump calls after he wins and says, we want to meet with you about Secretary of State. Actually Mike Pence calls him — Pence. Yeah.

mckay coppins

Mike Pence calls him and says —

carlos lozada

Who he also despises. He also despises Pence. Yeah. He hates everyone. Mitt holds grudges.

mckay coppins

Well, he — I said, he’s judgmental. So I think a couple things were going on there. One was — it’s hard to remember back then, but the immediate weeks after Trump won were genuinely scary for a lot of people. Like it felt like the world was going to spin off its axis. We’ve never had a truly just crazy person. This is the view of a lot of people in the Oval Office like, what’s going to happen?

carlos lozada

During that transition period.

mckay coppins

During that transition period. There was a very strong sentiment of, we need adults in the room. Whatever you thought of Trump and his campaign, we need to get as many adults in the room as possible. There were a bunch of people who joined the administration In the White House at that time with the very explicit goal of containing Trump and making sure that the country stayed on track. So that definitely was part of it, I think. And that speaks to the kind of Romney obligation. Right? It’s going to be embarrassing if I do this, but I have to do it. And I should say, I write about how he got calls from multiple former secretaries of state, including Hillary Clinton, saying, if they accept this job, you have to take it. But there’s another side, which is, he wanted the job. He wanted the power. There’s a quote in the book where he says to me, I wanted to be president. If you can’t have president, secretary of state is a pretty good —

carlos lozada

A good fall back.

mckay coppins

— consolation prize. Right? And so he was cleareyed about that with me now that he was tempted by the position. And, ultimately, he wasn’t willing to do what Trump and his camp kind of demanded of him, which was, you need to fully retract everything you said about me and say that I’m going to be an amazing president.

carlos lozada

But he did. He did say something.

mckay coppins

He went as far as he could.

carlos lozada

Here’s the letter. This is page 189. So this is after he has the meeting. He comes out and he speaks publicly. He says, “What I’ve seen through these discussions I’ve had with the President-elect Trump, as well as what we’ve seen in his speech the night of his victory, as well as the people he selected as part of his transition, all of those things combined give me increasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future.” Now, you put that statement alongside the speech he’d given just months earlier denouncing him in every possible way, and it’s just hard to believe it’s the same guy. Yeah. Well, once again, I think the rationalization instinct kicks in. Right? He basically convinces himself, I need to be in this room. I need to have this job. And so I’m going to go as far as I can to try to get this job. And that was him kind of audition, right? He gives the speech. He gets a call shortly thereafter from Trump basically saying, that’s not enough. You need to go further. Romney can’t go further. And that’s ultimately where it falls apart. Now, subsequently, people would claim that Trump was never going to offer him the job. This was just to toy with Romney and to embarrass him. My reporting suggests that’s not true. I think that Trump was seriously considering him in part, because if he could get some of his most vocal critics — On board.

mckay coppins

— on board, then he would look good. But I think that episode was sort of the Last temptation Romney had to join the Trump train. And after that point, after he doesn’t get it, and then after seeing what the first 100 days of the Trump presidency brings, he’s basically fully committed to being a Republican critic of, opponent of, bulwark against Trumpism.

carlos lozada

When, Romney decides to run for Senate, he reflects on the Yeats poem, “The Second Coming“, and “The best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity.” Did he see himself as the best? Did he see — did he see the Trump crowd as the worst? What did that mean to him?

mckay coppins

That was — the very explicit reference to that poem and that line in particular was that, the way he described it to me is, the Matt Gates’s of the world, and the Charlottesville marchers, and the very worst elements of the Republican coalition are empowered and on the rise. And the people who know that racism is wrong, and who know that authoritarianism is wrong, and who believe in the Constitution, and democracy, and pluralism are being silent because they’re scared. And they don’t know what to do. And Mitt Romney saw himself as somebody who could come in and be a voice for those people. And hopefully, he in his, mind empower them to speak up. He still thought, let me get into the Senate. I was the nominee not that long ago. I was the standard-bearer of the Republican Party. Let me see if I can get these guys to come back to their senses and speak up in defense of traditional Republican values. And that ended up being a little more difficult than he thought it would be.

carlos lozada

Of course, the other famous moment in that poem is, things fall apart. The center cannot hold. Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world. Did he think of himself as holding up the center? Or was he’s still thinking of himself as a sort of partisan?

mckay coppins

The center, I don’t think he meant the center of the political spectrum. He probably saw it more as like the center of the Republican Party, the kind of mainstream establishment of the party. That’s what he was representing. Though this brings up, I think, an important point. Part of why Romney ultimately was able to find his voice in these last few years is because the stakes of American politics changed. And the terms of the debate changed such that the things that we were debating as a country were not marginal tax rates or deficit reduction. It was like, do you believe in a pluralistic society? Do you believe in —

carlos lozada

Freedom of the press.

mckay coppins

— freedom of the press. Do you believe in these fundamental things that weren’t really up for debate a few years ago, and now seemed like they were. And Romney, while he doesn’t hold strong partisan positions on most issues, does hold strong positions on those issues. And so I think that’s part of why he now seems so animated.

carlos lozada

There’s a moment when he’s campaigning and he’s asked in a rally or in some event, so are you going to try to shut down CNN and The New York Times? And he’s like, no, no, why would I do that? He still seems constantly surprised. He’s very generous with the benefit of the doubt often.

mckay coppins

He wants to think the best of people. And he wants to assume —

carlos lozada

Which is a beautiful sentiment.

mckay coppins

— that everybody has good intentions. I think it’s why some of his critics might say he was ill suited for this moment in politics. Because assuming bad faith in people doesn’t come naturally to him. But it is true that in — so that was when he was running for Senate in Utah. And it was actually a clarifying moment for him. Because this woman asked, what are you going to do to shut down major American news organizations? And there was applause for that sentiment. And it was kind of a moment where he realized the trickle down effect of Donald Trump as president, is that these Republican voters, even in Utah, which is a state that was — for a red state pretty averse to Trump in 2016. These anti-democratic ideas were taking root among Romney supporters. And it made him realize how precarious this moment was for America.

carlos lozada

One thing that really stuck out at me is that once he becomes a senator, his relationship to rationalization changes. You write that maybe after so many years of allowing the petty indignities and moral compromises to pile up, he’d finally reached his limit. Also you say, the path to higher office was closed now. Moral tests mattered more than they once did. I didn’t know what to make of that. Because in some ways, it’s great to see Romney unleashed, a Senator. You know, it’s like his Bulworth moment. He’s just sort of saying what he really believes. But to say that, well, now that the stakes are low, now that I won’t be president, I can really say what I. Think and that, to me, conflicted with this other thing that Romney says to you, which is that he was less pissed off at true believers than he was at people who were just kind of hiding what they really thought. And yet, hadn’t he been doing that? Implicitly, he’s admitting that he had. Because he’s saying, well, now that I’m in the Senate now, and now that any other high office is closed off to me, now I can really kind of like say what I think. He might take issue with this characterization, but to me it’s clear that part of the reason he’s so judgmental of his colleagues, who say one thing in private and then take a different position in public, is because he recognizes a little of his past self in them. I think we’re often most judgmental of those who commit the sins that we know we commit. And I think that that’s part of what is going on with him. But implicit in this whole project that he embarked on with me was the idea that he acknowledged he hadn’t been fully candid or fully honest with himself during those earlier years of his political rise. And so I think you could ding him for that. But it’s also true that as he’s now taking stock of his career, he’s being honest about where he fell short. And I think it would be great if a lot more people would do that. By the way, I’ll just put it out there, if anybody else wants to embark on a two year therapy session with me and then let me write a book about it, I would love to. McKay Coppins is available for regretful politicians everywhere. He does say it to you in a way that sounds like Mitt Romney. He says, I think I recognize now my capacity to rationalize decisions that are in my self-interest.

mckay coppins

Yes.

carlos lozada

There’s a power in the admission, even if it’s kind of a late in life admission.

mckay coppins

Well, and when he said that to me, it was — when I asked him, would you have taken the same lonely principled vote to impeach Trump if this had been decades earlier? And he thought about it. And I remember we were sitting in his hideaway, his Senate hideaway office, a little windowless room in the Capitol. And he thought really hard about that. And he gave me that answer, which I thought was kind of remarkably honest. For a lot of his career, he was able to do what he thought he needed to do to win by convincing himself that what was in his best interest was also the right thing to do.

carlos lozada

So last night. I also watched his shorter 2020 speech, “Voting to Convict“, where he explains his vote to convict Trump in the Senate impeachment trial. It is a remarkable speech. It’s so different from the 2016 speech where he’s condemning Trump more broadly. That speech, it was almost fun. But this speech, it is somber, it is emotional. When he talks about his faith, he chokes up. He has to stop.

mitt romney — serious. As a Senator juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.

carlos lozada

It is a statement of high principle. I think it’s a speech people are going to remember, more than his convention speech, or his campaign speeches, or that speech condemning Trump. I think that’s the Romney speech. And one thing I was so struck by was something that happened just before the speech. Word kind of leaks out that he’s going to vote to convict, and he’s going to explain. And he gets a call from his former running mate, Paul Ryan. And the moment you bring that up in the book, I naïvely assumed that Paul Ryan was going to be like, hey, Mitt, I heard you’re going to do this. I’m sure you wrestled with it. This is probably a really hard thing. I just want you to know that I’ve got your back. I’m here for you. Follow your conscience. But no.

mckay coppins

No.

carlos lozada

The call was like, hey, I hear you’re going to take this principled stand. Do you really want to do that? Is that smart? Is that savvy? Should you? Like, I was shocked by it. And maybe my expectations or aspirations for Paul Ryan, or for the kind of running mate relationship, were too high. But I just couldn’t believe that that happened. What did he make of that call?

mckay coppins

So I should say first that Mitt was not the one who told me first about that call. Somebody else in his orbit who knew about it told me about it first. And then I brought it up with him. And I brought it up with Ryan too, who confirmed the call. Not necessarily the characterization, but the essential detail.

carlos lozada

The tenor. The fact that —

mckay coppins

Exactly.

carlos lozada

Yeah.

mckay coppins

And that episode is so interesting to me because it showed truly how alone Mitt Romney was in that vote.

carlos lozada

His running mate.

mckay coppins

This is his former running mate, and somebody he really loves, like a son in some ways. Paul Ryan —

carlos lozada

People didn’t want him to pick Ryan,

mckay coppins

No, no, no.

carlos lozada

Yeah. He liked Ryan.

mckay coppins

He liked Ryan. He respected him. He felt like they had a kind of kindred spirit thing going on.

carlos lozada

Like the policy wonkiness?

mckay coppins

Yeah. Exactly.

carlos lozada

The budget.

mckay coppins

The budget, yep. And even — Paul Ryan would have blended in with his sons as kind of a dark haired, blandly handsome guy. He really admired and respected Paul Ryan, to the point where he was much less judgmental of Ryan’s capitulations to Trump than he was of other Republicans. He sort of convinced himself, he was the Speaker of the House, he kind of had to do what he needed to do to get his agenda passed. But to have this moment, I think, where Paul Ryan calls him — Paul Ryan wasn’t the Speaker of the House anymore. He wasn’t in office anymore. He had really no reason to whip votes for Trump. So to do that, I think showed just how out on a limb Romney was. There’s another moment right before that where he tells his senior staff, Mitt Romney, that he’s going to vote to convict. And one of his senior staffers, she just puts her head down in her hands and doesn’t look up for the rest of the meeting because she’s so disappointed in him, or disappointed in what this is going to mean for his place in the party, and maybe for her future career prospects. But Romney was really — did not have a lot of allies in this vote. Besides, I should say, his family. Which is ultimately what I think buoyed him throughout this whole process. In fact, there’s a moment — because he goes — I have his journals from when he’s — throughout that impeachment process, that trial. And he’s agonizing every day over how to vote. And every day he’s considering the evidence. And he tells Ann — he calls Ann and tells her, I think I’m going to vote to acquit. And she says, I’m surprised by that. And she doesn’t say anything else. It doesn’t — renders no judgment. Doesn’t argue with him. But he immediately is like, oh, I need to go back to the drawing board. Because so much of him, his life, has been kind of dedicated to winning and keeping Ann’s respect. And to a lesser degree, but still important, his sons. And he had talked it over with his sons and his wife. And they all supported him in this. But really not that many other people did.

carlos lozada

Yeah, it’s interesting how many things he tried to do behind the scenes to stop Trump, both in 2016, also in 2020. He approaches Joe Manchin about forming a third party. He was very active in that effort.

mckay coppins

It’s funny. It’s one of those things, whenever a Republican kind of speaks out against Trump, the immediate kind of cynical response from a lot of people on the left is, well, why didn’t you do anything about it? Words are cheap. You should do something. And I understand that sentiment. There’s been a lot of that. Mitt Romney is somebody who’s actually done quite a lot. Not just the famous vote to impeach, but behind the scenes you can — as I kind of show in this book, he was constantly hustling to stop Trump, in both campaigns. And I think the same is true in this campaign as well.

carlos lozada

So you conclude with this scene about his father’s obituary. Some years ago, I think his daughter-in-law gave him “The New York Times Book of the Dead“, which is a collection of notable obits the paper had run throughout its history. And he says, she knows I’m fascinated with this stuff. Among the hundreds of obituaries covering celebrities, presidents, entrepreneurs, and civil rights leaders, he looked for his dad’s. For Mitt, no man loomed larger in history than George Romney. He was an icon, a legend, the embodiment of integrity in public service. But George’s entry was nowhere to be found. It bothered him at first, eventually he made his peace with it. Even if history only writes one line about you, he tells me, you’d like it to be a good line. And when I read that, it struck me on its own. But then later when I watched his Senate speech, he ends with a very similar sentiment to your final line in the book. He says — this is the Senate speech when he’s explaining why he’s voting to convict Donald Trump.

mitt romney I will only be one name among many. no more, no less. To future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial, they will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong, grievously wrong. We are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on Earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.

carlos lozada

That distinction is like the one line. You just want your one line to be a good one. So I have no doubt that this book will go a long way to shaping how we perceive the legacy of Mitt Romney. I hope that, unlike his own concerns, he has many, many more years of life remaining. But what do you think the first line of Mitt Romney’s obituary will be?

mckay coppins

I think history is a ruthless editor. I think that the more distance that we have from his life, the less and less will be remembered about it. I do think, though, that whether it’s his obituary or history books 30, 50, 100 years from now, if he comes up, it will be for that moment of conscience toward the end of his political career. That speech on the Senate floor, I agree with you, will be the thing that if there’s one scene that people remember from Mitt Romney’s life and career, it’ll probably be that. I obviously think there’s a lot more to say about him. I wrote a book about him. But I think that if we could all be remembered for eventually reaching the best version of ourselves, I think that would be wonderful. And I think that would be fair for him.

carlos lozada

McKay, this has been a real pleasure. We will end as all episodes of this show end by asking you for three book recommendations.

mckay coppins

OK, I’ve got the three recommendations here. A mix of sentimental, and plugging for a friend, and then a little bit of self-indulgence. So first, I’m going to recommend “The Last Politician” by Franklin Foer. My colleague at The Atlantic just came out last month about the first two years of the Biden presidency. I think uncommonly well written for an inside the White House story, and revealed things about the president that I didn’t know and kind of his character that have stuck with me. Number two, “Number The Stars” by Lois Lowry. This is a shout out to my fifth grade daughter, my oldest daughter, who read this book last year. And it’s about a Jewish family’s escape from Denmark during World War II. She started reading this book in school. Was obsessed with it and said, dad, you have to read it with me so that we can talk about it. So I started reading it with her, and lovely book. Like, really just a really touching story. And I would just say also, given current events, understanding the persecution of Jews and anti-Semitism, for a child, it was kind of a good opening point for those conversations. The last one, I cheated, but I feel like it’s OK because I’ve heard you — I think others have cheated on this question too. It’s actually three books, all on the same theme. “The Plot” by Jean Hanff Korelitz, “Hell of a Book” by Jason Mott and “Less” by Andrew Sean Greer. All three novels published in the last few years about writers embarking on book tours. Very different stories.

carlos lozada

I’ve read “Less.” It’s amazing.

mckay coppins

It’s very funny, and heartwarming, and beautiful. In some of them, murders happen. In some of them, existential crises happen. In some of them, moments of enlightenment occur. “Less” is the one I read most recently. And I just couldn’t put it down. I read the sequel, “Less is Lost.” But as an author embarking on a book tour, I’m now hoping that I have as exciting an experience as these three fictional characters.

carlos lozada

McKay Coppins, author of “Romney: A Reckoning“, thank you so much for being on the show.

mckay coppins

874,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/us/california-raises-minimum-wage-health-care-fast-food.html,"For thousands of Californians, wages are going up.

Gov. Gavin Newsom recently approved two major pay bumps: One new law, signed this month, will raise the minimum wage for all health care workers in the state to $25 an hour by 2028. The other law increases minimum hourly pay for fast-food workers to $20 an hour, starting in April.

California’s current overall minimum wage, at $15.50, already exceeds most other states (Washington State’s and the District of Columbia’s are higher) and will increase to $16 on Jan. 1. Californians will vote in November 2024 on whether to push it up even more, to $18 an hour.

The bills Newsom just signed add a new twist; they’re California’s first statewide minimums for specific economic sectors, according to Enrique Lopezlira, a labor economist at the U.C. Berkeley Labor Center.

Lopezlira said that the two new laws were a testament to the growing power and popularity of organized labor nationwide. Public support for unions among Americans hasn’t been this high in Gallup polls since the 1960s. In California, that has been evident through emerging unionization efforts as well as the enormous number of strikes we’ve seen statewide, including by Kaiser Permanente employees, dockworkers and Hollywood writers and actors."
875,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/books/review/the-sisterhood-liza-mundy.html,"We learn of a trio of women who sniffed out the C.I.A. mole Aldrich Ames long before the F.B.I. was onto him. Their radars had gone off when Ames’s wife casually mentioned that she’d ordered treatments for every window in her new house. These women knew how hard it was to zhuzh on a C.I.A. officer’s salary; who, exactly, was paying for the curtains? (The F.B.I. took full credit for the arrest.)

The dossier-compiling of the vault women morphed into the discipline we now know as targeting. In 1986, a new counterterrorist center opened, specializing in tracing and mapping networks — a meticulous approach to man-hunting. With the exception of its male leader, women made up almost all of the staff of what came to be known as Alec Station. Colleagues marveled at its makeup: “a bunch of chicks” chasing clues from their desks.

When that “bunch of chicks” detected that a catastrophic attack on American soil was imminent and tried to warn C.I.A. leaders, most shooed them off. In one of the book’s most devastating chapters, Mundy details how the women of Alec Station — including Barbara Sude, who, a month before 9/11, wrote the famous memo “Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.” — watched the twin towers fall from the lo-fi hookups in their offices.

Mundy concludes “The Sisterhood” with the hunt for Osama bin Laden. In the end, it was the sight of clothes drying on a line that helped confirm to bin Laden’s obsessive pursuers that he and his wives had been hiding out in a guarded compound in Pakistan. Women’s work.

Between the portraits of the female spies who persisted, “The Sisterhood” catalogs their revolts. In 1977, Harritte Thompson brought a complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity office demonstrating that women made less than men in the same jobs — and that men were promoted faster. When the C.I.A. slow-rolled the issue, she filed a lawsuit and won. In 1994, Janine Brookner filed a federal sexual discrimination lawsuit, which the agency settled. Brookner’s case was tied up with a much larger class-action lawsuit, involving over 200 officers alleging an endemic culture of sexual discrimination, that was not settled until 1995. The fallout, as some of the trailblazers anticipated, was pervasive retaliation for having taken part. Mundy quotes a male case officer, who sat in meetings where women who’d participated in the suit were shut out of prestigious assignments. “It’s not an organization that takes this type of dissent well,” he said. “They were punished,” Harper told Mundy. “Nobody wanted them.”"
876,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/world/middleeast/erdogan-turkey-hamas-israel.html,"President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey lashed out at Israel and defended Hamas during a televised address on Wednesday, taking positions likely to increase tensions between his government and those of other NATO members, including the United States.

Speaking in Parliament to lawmakers from his Justice and Development Party, Mr. Erdogan accused Israel of deliberately attacking civilians in Gaza and killing large numbers of children, women and older people.

“This picture alone is enough to show that the aim here is not self-defense, but savagery to commit the premeditated act of crime against humanity,” he said.

Mr. Erdogan also criticized Western countries for their strong backing of Israel and for branding Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that controls Gaza, as a terrorist organization.

“Hamas is not a terror organization,” he said. “It is an organization of liberation, of mujahedeen, who fight to protect their land and citizens.”

Mr. Erdogan’s comments stand in stark contrast to the stances of Western countries, which have offered strong support for Israel since Hamas led an attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 that killed more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 220 others, both civilians and soldiers, back to Gaza as captives.

Even before that attack, the United States, the European Union and other countries considered Hamas a terrorist organization.

But Mr. Erdogan’s criticism of Israel’s response — which has included urging more than a million Gazans to flee to the seaside enclave’s southern half, and a heavy bombing campaign that has heavily damaged civilian neighborhoods— reflected sentiments that have become common in parts of the Arab and Muslim worlds. The Israeli bombardment has killed more than 6,500 people, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run Health Ministry.

Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas and has been massing its troops on the border of Gaza for a possible ground invasion. Its military says that it takes precautions to avoid killing civilians but that Hamas makes this more difficult by mixing its forces in with the civilian population.

Turkey has had turbulent relations with Israel during Mr. Erdogan’s two decades as its dominant politician, often tied to Mr. Erdogan’s anger over the Israeli treatment of Palestinians.

But recently, Mr. Erdogan made steps at rapprochement with the Jewish state.

Last year, Turkey welcomed Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, in Ankara, the capital, the first such visit by an Israeli head of state since 2008. In a separate visit, the Israeli defense minister met with his Turkish counterpart, and the officials vowed to resume working relations."

Start-ups are not alone in being drawn into the war in Gaza: Major global companies, especially those in tech, have significant numbers of employees in the country. Microsoft said this week that it had nearly 3,000 workers in Israel.

The semiconductor giant Nvidia confirmed that a man seen on video being kidnapped by Hamas assailants at a music festival last weekend was an employee named Avinatan Or. The company has also canceled a conference in Tel Aviv that was scheduled for next week.

The Israeli economy has shown resilience to military action before, Moody’s, the credit rating agency, said this week. But it added, “A prolonged conflict that durably and significantly impairs economic activity and policymaking would test that resilience.”

The Treasury Department has sent two of its top officials to the Middle East and Europe this week to coordinate an international effort to prevent Hamas from evading previous sanctions and find new ways to cut the group off from the international financial system. The United States estimates that Hamas controls $500 million worth of assets that it uses to finance terrorism.

“We will not hesitate to take action to further degrade Hamas’s ability to commit horrific terrorist attacks by relentlessly targeting its financial activities and streams of funding,” Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, said in a statement. He added that the United States was working with allies to “deny Hamas the ability to exploit the international financial system.”

“The Last Days of the Late Great State of California” by Curt Gentry (1968)

“The novel begins with an account of a massive earthquake on the San Andreas fault that threatens to split the westernmost part of California into the Pacific Ocean. This catastrophic event is the basis for a look back on major events in the Golden State’s political and social history. Ronald Reagan’s campaign for governor in 1966 and the Watts Riots of 1965 are described in detail. The epilogue lays out what the rest of the world would do without, including the significant amount of food produced by California’s important agricultural industry. It is an entertaining history lesson slipped into a story about something we Californians often muse about: Will the Big One slide our coastal cities into the ocean?” — Allison Wonder, San Ramon

“There There” by Tommy Orange (2018)

“Orange’s novel ‘There There’ is a story unlike any I’ve read. With 12 main characters, all of which shine on their own without feeling rushed or incomplete, their paths converge at the Oakland Powwow. This book is a master lesson in storytelling and provides a unique look at the urban Native American experience.” — Jennifer Nuñez, San Jose

“Palo Alto” by Malcolm Harris (2023)

“I grew up in the Santa Clara Valley in the ’50s and ’60s and had a very simple and idyllic impression of the contributions that the valley made to society — i.e., Hewlett-Packard and other early tech innovators. The author chillingly brings us to the current time and all the frightening outcomes of the earlier, relatively simple days. The book is long, but well worth reading.” — Hester Lyons, Brooklyn, N.Y.

“Slouching Toward Bethlehem” by Joan Didion (1968)

“The centerpiece, her report from Haight-Ashbury in the ’60s, feels so much more honest and curious than the usual rose-colored boomer reminiscing I read about that period. Her writing makes me nostalgic for places I’ve never been, like the hot, quaint Sacramento of her youth.” — David Burris, Los Angeles

“Up and Down California in 1860-1864” by William Henry Brewer (1930)

“This is an entertaining, readable journal describing conditions in the state in its infancy, written during Brewer’s tenure as a distinguished, field-going member of the California Geological Survey. Notable is his description of the Great Flood of 1862, with its foreshadowing of potential disaster for Californians today.” — Jeff Stone, Yreka"

You talked in your campaign for the House about your conservative values. Members of the Freedom Caucus see themselves as defenders of conservative values. What is your definition of a conservative, and how is it different from what that smaller segment of the Freedom Caucus is about?

I see conservatism as supporting federalism, keeping power at the local level to the maximum extent possible, peace through strength, the role of the family is the most important institution in our country, being pro-life. You want to keep violent criminals behind bars, don’t let them out early, because that’s how we’re getting the increase in violence. We believe in trying to balance the budget. I think the new brand of so-called conservatism today is more of populism, because it’s not really conservative in my book. It’s 1930s Republicanism, which was more isolationist, didn’t want to get involved in Europe at all. A lot of the things you hear today from the populist wing sound a lot like the Republicans in the 1930s, and they weren’t very popular. We had F.D.R. They didn’t win back then, either.

There was a party called the Know-Nothing Party in the mid-19th century. You read some of those dumb comments back then. Well, some of the stuff I read today sounds parallel to that, too. They’re convinced Ukraine has armed Hamas. I’m getting all the stuff sent to me, and it’s just not true. But because they read it, it becomes truth, even though it’s on a, I would say, a very skeptical news source. If you find out that Ukraine sent weapons to Hamas, would you tell me?"
886,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/opinion/economy-recession-inflation.html,"Until quite recently there was a near consensus among forecasters that the U.S. economy was headed for a recession. In fact, it’s been exactly one year since Bloomberg declared that, according to its models, the probability of a recession by October 2023 — that is, now — was 100 percent.

Oops.

OK, it’s possible — barely — that a recession has begun but isn’t in the data yet. Economists of a certain age remember that for much of 2008, some commentators denied that there was a recession underway, but the official business cycle chronology now says that the worst slump since the 1930s began in December 2007. That said, warning indicators like the Sahm rule, which looks at the unemployment rate compared with its previous low, were flashing red by the summer of 2008, in a way they aren’t now:"

Tailors sew dozens of them a day in the narrow alleys of buzzing markets. Taxi drivers put them on their dashboards.

Among the sea of flags flying high in a burst of patriotic fervor in Burkina Faso, Mali and lately Niger, countries that have recently undergone military coups, the red, white and blue flag of the Russian Federation has become commonplace. While it carries political overtones, it has emerged as a trendy accessory, much like a Che Guevara illustration a generation ago in the West.

“Stylish,” Nana Fidaous said about the loose outfit made with Russia’s colors that she had donned at a recent pro-military demonstration in Niger’s capital, Niamey. A high school student, Ms. Fidaous said she wasn’t sure about the symbolic meaning of wearing Russia’s colors. But she said it was time to learn more about President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and what he could bring to Niger, which has been squeezed by sanctions and border closures by its West African neighbors in the wake of the coup.

As Russia has made inroads in some West and Central African countries, its flag has been the most visible sign of a broader geopolitical shift in the region, along with Russian weapons and mercenaries."

THE LOOM OF TIME: Between Empire and Anarchy, From the Mediterranean to China, by Robert D. Kaplan

In early November 1914, as the storm clouds of World War I closed in on the Middle East, the American consul general in Beirut sent an urgent message to the U.S. secretary of state. “Sir,” W. Stanley Hollis wrote, “I have the honor to report that conditions are going from bad to worse here.”

I was reminded of Hollis’s notes while reading Vincent Bevins’s “If We Burn” and Robert D. Kaplan’s “The Loom of Time.” In both books, our interlocutors, recently returned from travels to some of the planet’s more intemperate zones, expound on their findings. Their frames are quite different. Whereas Bevins looks to the mass protest movements of the past decade and a half and ponders why matters went so terribly awry, Kaplan has trekked the greater Middle East in search of clues for what the near future there might hold. Spoiler alert: It seems Hollis had it pegged just about right.

As a correspondent for The Los Angeles Times, Bevins spent much of the early 2010s reporting from Latin America, followed by an extended tour in Southeast Asia for The Washington Post. His first book, the critically acclaimed “Jakarta Method,” was a scathing exposé of the central role the C.I.A. played in orchestrating Indonesia’s savage 1965 anti-communist pogrom. “If We Burn” is both more ambitious and more wide-ranging.

From the Arab Spring revolts in the Middle East to the so-called Candlelight Revolution in South Korea, according to Bevins, the 2010s saw more mass protests around the world than any other similar time span in human history. “It might even be possible to tell the story of that decade as the story of mass protests and their unexpected consequences,” he writes."
889,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war.html,"As Russia mounted wave after wave of attacks over the summer, Sgt. Mykola Rogozovets and fellow members of his unit started drawing little plus signs in the dirt of their bunker while artillery shook the ground around them.

Each cross, said Sergeant Rogozovets, a 48-year-old unit commander in Ukraine’s First Presidential Brigade, represented a Russian soldier they had killed in fighting. He added 12 plus signs in a single day in August, he said, before a shell exploded at his position in northeast Ukraine and his left shoulder was wounded by shrapnel.

“When new guys replaced us, they asked, ‘What are these pluses?’” he said Friday in an interview at a base outside Kyiv. He told them what they stood for and then left with these words: “‘Continue our mission, kill the enemy and put pluses.’”

Ukraine, like all wars, is in large part about attrition: killing enough enemy soldiers and destroying enough of their equipment so that the opponent can no longer bear the cost of fighting."
890,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/11/nyregion/boat-denmark-jewish-museum.html,"The Gerda III, with a top speed of eight knots, could make the lighthouse run in a couple of hours. It could manage to go on to Sweden and return before the Germans realized it had been gone a little longer than it should have been gone. The crew worked fast: Kliger said that Jews who had disembarked in Sweden sometimes turned around to thank the crew, “and the boat was already gone, to make it back and not be discovered.”

The Gerda III had been on the water since the 1920s, carrying supplies, mail and lighthouse keepers to an installation at the entrance to the Øresund. It was one of 300 boats used to evacuate Jews to Sweden; Kliger said that only two others are known to still exist. Denmark donated the Gerda III to the museum in 1989, and it was restored in a Danish shipyard before making the trip across the Atlantic.

Kliger said that when he went to Denmark a couple of years ago to retrace the route across the Øresund, he met a man who had been evacuated when he was 9 years old. “He remembered being herded into the hold under nets and tarps and being told to be very quiet,” Kliger said.

“The first half of the trip was in Danish waters that were German-patrolled,” he continued. The crew told the stowaways, “When you hear the boat slow down, when you hear boots on the deck, you have to be absolutely silent.” The sound of the boots receded, and the boat went on."
891,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/opinion/trump-republican-primaries.html,"If people seem to be unable to take in more information about Mr. Trump and if the election is shaping up to be a familiar repeat, the year ahead will not be. He views the world as one of perception, to be worked over and over again until it bends. To serve as a juror in this random selected position of authority, tasked with assessing what happened, for it to be your responsibility to step outside yourself and whatever you think about Mr. Trump and make decisions about him and the law is a weight that only a few dozen people will know. The rest of us will be outside in the chaos of perception, trying to make sense of it.

And he’ll be inside and outside, perhaps still revisiting the decisive moment of his defeat and linking it with anything that’s gone wrong. “We would have had a deal with Iran. We would have had no inflation. Russia would have never ever in a million years gone into Ukraine,” he said in Waterloo. His sense of what if, what if, can draw a listener back further, to think about how much “what if” still shapes politics.

The entire Republican Party has, for nearly a decade now, operated on a dream sequence of the possibility of passive collapse. What if he just went away? When Joe Biden ran in 2020, his campaign looked to correct the decisive mistake of the past: Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016. That was not, Mr. Biden often suggested, who we were. The implicit promise was the restoration of morality and normality. What if the 2020 election could be a reset?

It’s easy to follow all these dream sequences into another: What if Mr. Trump could just return to New York, had never run for president, were no longer talking in loops? What if the country didn’t have to live through a remix of the 2020 election or change people’s lives by putting them on juries or live in the unknown we have not yet really reckoned with of what it will be like to live through the trials of our former president?

This election seems like the one before only on the surface. Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden and the rest of us keep getting older; everything and everyone seems a little fried. Eight years in, there’s nothing that weird about seeing people wearing T-shirts with his mug shot staring back at him while a Backstreet Boys song from 1999 plays, the entire Republican field sounding like echoes of Mr. Trump as he talks about Mrs. Clinton, moving in and out of the present and back in time sonically."
892,https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-seattle-restaurants.html,"Bateau is like no other steakhouse in the United States. While it’s possible to run up an expense-account-worthy tab and get a bracing martini, there are no dark wood appointments, no commodious booths. Instead, the chef Renee Erickson has taken the Pacific Northwest sensibilities of her Sea Creatures restaurant group and channeled them through this carnivorous counterpoint. There is a big chalkboard listing the day’s available steaks — when they run out of a cut, it’s erased — and less popular but no less delicious choices like the culotte and rump cap are fixtures. That’s because the restaurant uses as much of the animal as possible, and a cow carries only so many rib-eyes. In that same spirit, sides like smoked-and-spiced shank jerky and beef liver mousse optimize off-cuts and other bovine ingredients. BRIAN GALLAGHER
