0,0,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/25/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-death-toll.html,"More women and children have been reported killed in Gaza in less than two months than the roughly 7,700 civilians documented as killed by U.S. forces and their international allies in the entire first year of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, according to estimates from Iraq Body Count, an independent British research group.

And the number of women and children reported killed in Gaza since the Israeli campaign began last month has already started to approach the roughly 12,400 civilians documented to have been killed by the United States and its allies in Afghanistan during nearly 20 years of war, according to Neta C. Crawford, a University of Oxford professor who is co-director of Brown University’s Costs of War Project.

These comparisons are based on the thousands of deaths directly attributed to U.S. coalition forces over decades in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Far more people — hundreds of thousands in total — are estimated to have been killed in these conflicts by other groups, including the Syrian government and its allies, local militias, the Islamic State and the Iraqi security forces.

But while the overall death tolls in those wars were larger, the number of people killed in Gaza “in a very short period of time is higher than in other conflicts,” said Professor Crawford, who has extensively researched modern wars.

In the nine-month battle of Mosul, which Israeli officials have cited as a comparison, an estimated total of 9,000 to 11,000 civilians were killed by all sides in the conflict, including many thousands killed by the Islamic State, The Associated Press found.

A similar number of women and children have already been reported killed in Gaza in less than two months.

The bombs being used in Gaza are larger than what the United States used when it was fighting ISIS in cities like Mosul and Raqqa, and are more consistent with targeting underground infrastructure like tunnels, said Brian Castner, a weapons investigator for Amnesty International and a former explosive ordnance disposal officer in the U.S. Air Force.

More than twice as many women and children have already been reported killed in Gaza than have been confirmed killed in Ukraine, according to United Nations figures, after almost two years of Russian attacks. (The United Nations believes the true toll in Ukraine is considerably higher, however, and Ukrainian officials have estimated that more than 20,000 civilians died in the port city of Mariupol.)

Not only is Gaza tiny when compared with conflict zones like Ukraine, Afghanistan or Iraq, but the territory’s borders have also been closed by Israel and Egypt, giving civilians few, if any, safe places to flee.

More than 60,000 buildings have been damaged or destroyed in the Gaza Strip, satellite analysis indicates, including about half of the buildings in northern Gaza.

“They are using extremely large weapons in extremely densely populated areas,” Mr. Castner said of Israeli forces. “It is the worst possible combination of factors.”

A War ‘for Our Existence’

Israeli officials say their campaign is focused on degrading Gazan military infrastructure that is often built near homes and civilian institutions — or buried underneath them.

“To get to that target,” Colonel Conricus said, the military has to use “larger bombs with a higher yield.”

When an Israeli government spokesman, Mark Regev, was asked in an Oct. 24 interview with PBS about the pace of the strikes, he said Israel was aiming for a shorter campaign than the United States waged in Iraq and Syria.

“Hopefully, we get it done quicker,” Mr. Regev said. “That’s one of our goals. But it could take longer than many Israelis would hope, because Hamas has been in power for 16 years.”

Israel has directed Gaza residents to evacuate areas where the bombing campaign is especially concentrated, but it has continued to strike other areas as well.

More broadly, Israeli officials say this is a campaign on its own borders to wipe out Hamas, a group dedicated to Israel’s destruction. “The war here is for our existence,” one Israeli war cabinet minister, Benny Gantz, told reporters on Nov. 8.

The brutality of the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 traumatized Israelis, and some prominent members of the Israeli government have made clear that they are waging a ferocious campaign.

“Gaza won’t return to what it was before. Hamas will no longer exist. We will eliminate everything,” Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defense minister, said in the days after the Hamas raids.

After initially questioning the death toll in Gaza, the Biden administration now concedes that the true figures for casualties may be even worse.

Barbara Leaf, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, told a House committee this month that American officials thought the casualties were “very high, frankly, and it could be that they’re even higher than are being cited.”

International experts who have worked with the Gaza Health Ministry during this and other wars say that it gathers death figures from hospitals and morgues across the enclave, which tally the dead and report the names, ID numbers and other details of people killed.

While the experts urged caution around public statements about the specific number of people killed in a particular strike — especially in the immediate aftermath of a blast — they said the aggregate death tolls reported by the Gaza Health Ministry have typically proved to be accurate.

In the last few weeks, recording the dead in Gaza has become increasingly difficult in the chaos of the fighting, as hospitals come under direct fire, much of the health system ceases to function and other government officials have begun updating the number of killed instead of the ministry. But even before those changes, the number of women and children reported dead already outpaced other conflicts.

Women and children account for nearly 70 percent of all deaths reported in Gaza even though most combatants are men — an “extraordinary statistic,” Rick Brennan, the regional emergency director for the World Health Organization’s Eastern Mediterranean office, said at an event this month.

Normally, one would expect the opposite, Mr. Brennan said. In past clashes between Israel and Hamas, for example, about 60 percent of the reported deaths in Gaza were men."
1,1,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/world/middleeast/israel-evacuees-border-attacks.html,"A joyful clamor echoed in the ballroom of the Golden Crown Hotel. Kindergarten was in full swing for 30 children from Arab al-Aramshe, a village next to Israel’s border with Lebanon. Only this class was meeting 44 miles south, in Nazareth, where nearly 800 of the village’s residents have been living since mid-October, when they were evacuated because of the risk of attacks by the militant group Hezbollah.

“On an emotional level, it’s hard for the children because their parents are under stress,” said Dalal Badra, an inspector from Israel’s Education Ministry, who was helping to organize the classes. “They can sense that something is wrong.”

These children are part of the largest internal displacement in Israel’s history, a modern-day exodus of more than 125,000 people. They have been evacuated from towns in the south, near Gaza, where Hamas extremists massacred Israeli civilians and soldiers a month ago, and from the north, where tensions have escalated in recent days as Israel has exchanged fire with Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, fueling fears that Hezbollah fighters will swarm across the border and do the same to them.

It is a logistically complex and costly operation for the Israeli state, which is paying to house the evacuees indefinitely in 280 hotels and guesthouses scattered across the country. As the days stretch into weeks, the government is setting up makeshift schools and medical clinics. In the south, where many of the evacuees survived the Hamas attacks, it has recruited specialists to offer trauma counseling.

The Golden Crown, which usually caters to tourists visiting biblical sites in the hometown of Jesus, has been converted into a kind of refugee resort, offering a simulacrum of village life. Its souvenir shop is closed, and the swimming pool has been drained, but the dining room offers three meals a day, the lobby heaves with strollers, and laundry flutters from the balconies of rooms packed with families.

Hunched over a laptop at the bar, Adeeb Mazal, Arab al-Aramshe’s community manager, tried to keep track of his vagabond villagers. He said he worried about getting enough aid to pay for their accommodations. He worried about how long they would have to stay in Nazareth. (Israeli officials estimate until the end of the year.) And he worried about their mental health, with the idleness nourishing their fears about Hezbollah.

“I try to explain to people, ‘We’re in an emergency situation; we’re not on vacation,’” said Mr. Mazal, who is 34 and, like virtually all of the residents of Arab al-Aramshe, a member of Israel’s minority Arab population."
2,2,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/12/world/middleeast/israel-death-toll-hamas-attack.html,"Israel revised its official estimated death toll of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, lowering the number to about 1,200 people, down from the more than 1,400 initially cited, a spokesman for the country’s Foreign Ministry said on Friday night.

The spokesman, Lior Haiat, said the original figure was an “initial estimate” that had now been updated. He declined to provide further details on the change, but emphasized that the numbers could continue to fluctuate as the remains of those killed are identified.

For both Israelis and Palestinians, the casualty counts in the monthlong war between Israel and Hamas have become emotionally charged figures. The tolls have become symbols for the depth of the agony gripping both peoples, and partisans on either side have sought to play down the number of those killed on the opposite camp.

Here what’s we know about the death toll in Israel from the Oct. 7 attack.

How many people were killed in Israel during the Oct. 7 attacks?

On Oct. 7, scores of Hamas gunmen swept into Israeli towns and military bases near the border with Gaza, opening fire on people in their homes, on the streets, and at a music festival. The attackers fatally shot the elderly, women and young children, according to survivors; others were burned after attackers set their homes ablaze.

The vast majority of those killed in the Oct. 7 assault — around 70 percent — have been identified as civilians, not soldiers, by Israeli authorities. According to Israeli police, health officials have identified at least 846 civilians killed in the fighting.

At least 278 soldiers were killed in the battles inside Israel, according to the Israeli military’s website, and at least 44 police officers died in the fighting, the Israel Police said in mid-October. (Additionally, at least 46 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the ground invasion of Gaza began at the end of the month.)

Those killed in Israel on Oct. 7 also included foreigners and dual nationals. At least 31 U.S. citizens and 39 French citizens were killed during the attacks, authorities in both countries have said. Other victims included at least 34 Thai nationals; Asian workers were a common sight in the farms near Israel’s border with Gaza.

Why did Israel’s figures change?

Israel’s original estimated toll from the attacks was subject to less scrutiny than the death toll compiled by the Hamas-controlled authorities in the Gaza Strip, where thousands have died in weeks of heavy Israeli bombardment and a ground invasion.

Some news outlets — including The New York Times — occasionally used those Israeli figures without attributing them to Israeli officials or noting that they were an initial estimate and subject to change.

One reason for the fluctuating death toll is that Israeli health officials say they have struggled to identify many Israelis and foreigners killed in the attacks, and they excluded from the official toll the remains of those they considered to have been attackers, highlighting the complicated task of giving an accurate, authoritative count."

4,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/12/world/middleeast/netanyahu-gaza-hamas-palestinian-authority.html,"Even as Israeli tanks and ground troops continued to battle Hamas militants in Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday outlined a postwar vision for the territory, one that he said would not involve the Palestinian Authority in its current form.

“We need to see the following two things,” Mr. Netanyahu told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

“Gaza has to be demilitarized and Gaza has to be de-radicalized,” he said. “And I think so far, we haven’t seen any Palestinian force, including the Palestinian Authority, that is able to do it.”

Mr. Netanyahu said “overall military responsibility” would be handled by Israel after the war.

The comments were at odds with views expressed by the Biden administration, which last week made it clear that there should be no Israeli “re-occupation” of Gaza. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken left open the possibility of a “transition period” after the war, but said that eventually Gaza’s administration “must include Palestinian-led governance and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.”

The Israeli military released footage over the weekend of tanks rolling past the concrete shells of half-destroyed buildings in Gaza and soldiers scrambling through abandoned homes. The military said five Israeli soldiers were killed on Friday, including four in a blast from a booby-trapped tunnel shaft. More than 360 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel that killed 1,200 people and triggered the war.

The death toll among Gazans has been more than 11,000, according to health authorities in Hamas-controlled Gaza. And 1.58 million Gazans, around three-quarters of the territory’s population, have been displaced, according to estimates by the United Nations."
5,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/world/europe/ukraine-israel-gps-jamming-spoofing.html,"Electronic warfare in the Middle East and Ukraine is affecting air travel far from the battlefields, unnerving pilots and exposing an unintended consequence of a tactic that experts say will become more common.

Planes are losing satellite signals, flights have been diverted and pilots have received false location reports or inaccurate warnings that they were flying close to terrain, according to European Union safety regulators and an internal airline memo viewed by The New York Times. The Federal Aviation Administration has also warned pilots about GPS jamming in the Middle East.

Radio frequency interference — intended to disrupt the satellite signals used by rockets, drones and other weaponry — spiked after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 and has grown even more intense this fall in the Middle East. The interference can involve jamming satellite signals by drowning them out with noise, or spoofing them — mimicking real satellite signals to trick recipients with misleading information.

The radio interference has so far not proven to be dangerous. But aircraft systems have proved largely unable to detect GPS spoofing and correct for it, according to Opsgroup, an organization that monitors changes and risks in the aviation industry. One Embraer jet bound for Dubai nearly veered into Iranian airspace in September before the pilots figured out the plane was chasing a false signal."
6,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-blackout.html,"Mr. Blinken said that efforts by the Biden administration to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and to prevent Iran and its proxies from expanding the conflict were making progress.

“We’re working, as I said, very aggressively on getting more humanitarian assistance into Gaza,” Mr. Blinken told reporters in Ankara, where he met with Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, before departing for Tokyo. “I think you’ll see in the days ahead that that assistance can expand in significant ways.”

King Abdullah II of Jordan said on Monday that his country’s air force had dropped “urgent medical aid” to a field hospital operated by the kingdom in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military confirmed the unusual move and said in a statement that it had been a coordinated effort between the neighboring nations.

Mr. Blinken also said that progress had been made, with help from Turkey and other countries, on preventing the conflict from expanding into a wider war.

The United States has been particularly focused on deterring Iran from joining the conflict. The U.S. Central Command, which oversees American forces in the region, announced on Sunday that it had dispatched a nuclear-powered attack submarine to the region, adding to the American military presence in the Middle East.

“Sometimes the absence of something bad happening may not be the most obvious evidence of progress, but it is,” Mr. Blinken said."
7,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/opinion/israel-gaza-war-compensation.html,"As the number of people killed in Gaza has exceeded 14,000, according to Gazan health officials, Israel faces worldwide condemnation for its offensive, which was paused last week. Israel insists that it is doing all it can to protect civilians, given the complex urban environment it is fighting in, the embedding of Hamas in the civilian population and persistent missile strikes.

But Israel must do more to address the suffering of Palestinians, now and after the war ends.

In the short term, Israel should pay compensation to the families of the dead in Gaza and treat the injured. In the future, it must also play a role in the enormous international effort that will be required to reconstruct the territory under its new government, whatever that may be.

While the hurdles are large for more immediate aid — including the willingness of Palestinians to accept help from the people who have bombed them and of Israelis to give it during a war against the perpetrators of an atrocity against Israeli civilians — the idea is worth considering.

Cash payments to victims of collateral harm are rare but not unprecedented. During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. forces made “condolence” payments usually in the range of $2,500 to $5,000 to some families for each person killed by U.S. troops during combat operations. These payments were expressions of sympathy, not restitution for damages, with the United States sidestepping liability. Israel can do the same."
8,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/opinion/israel-palestinians-war-iran.html,"The reason the Hamas-Israel war can be hard for outsiders to understand is that three wars are going on at the same time: a war between Israeli Jews and the Palestinians exacerbated by a terrorist group, a war within Israeli and Palestinian societies over the future and a war between Iran and its proxies and America and its allies.

But before we dig into those wars, here’s the most important thing to keep in mind about them: There’s a single formula that can maximize the chances that the forces of decency can prevail in all three. It is the formula that I think President Biden is pushing, even if he can’t spell it all out publicly now — and we should all push it with him: You should want Hamas defeated, as many Gazan civilians as possible spared, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his extremist allies booted, all the hostages returned, Iran deterred and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank reinvigorated in partnership with moderate Arab states.

Pay particular attention to that last point: A revamped Palestinian Authority is the keystone for the forces of moderation, coexistence and decency triumphing in all three wars. It is the keystone for reviving a two-state solution. It is the keystone for creating a stable foundation for the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia and the wider Arab Muslim world. And it is the keystone for creating an alliance among Israel, moderate Arabs, the United States and NATO that can weaken Iran and its proxies Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis — all of whom are up to no good.

Unfortunately, as Haaretz’s military correspondent, Amos Harel, reported on Tuesday, Netanyahu “is locked in by the extreme right and the settlers, who are fighting an all-out war against the idea of any involvement of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza mainly out of fear that the United States and Saudi Arabia will exploit such a move to restart the political process and push for a two-state solution in a way that will require Israel to make concessions in the West Bank.” So Netanyahu, “under pressure from his political partners, has banned any discussion of this option.”"

sabrina tavernise

From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise, and this is “The Daily.” The fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, now in its fifth day, has been historic in scope and success. At its heart are hostages. As of Monday night, 50 Israeli hostages have been released under its terms, as have 150 Palestinian prisoners, with more releases expected on Tuesday. Today, my colleague Isabel Kershner on the grassroots movement that managed to pause the war and what it will mean for the rest of the conflict. It’s Tuesday, November 28. So Isabel, it’s Monday around 9:00 PM for you. You’ve had a busy few days in Israel. And that is precisely why we want to talk to you today. So for the first time since October 7, we have had, for the most part, a halt in hostilities, no airstrikes in Gaza, no rockets into Israel. And there’s been this remarkable release of Israeli hostages and, of course, of Palestinian prisoners. So tell us what’s been happening.

isabel kershner

Well, since October the 7th, this country has been at war. And then suddenly, on Friday morning at 7:00 AM the guns went silent. And this was a result of a deal that had been reached between Israel and Hamas, with a mediation from outside. And the outlines of that deal was that Israel would cease fire for four days. During that time, Israel would allow an increased amount of aid and fuel to go into the Gaza Strip. And at the same time, Hamas had committed to release 50 of the Israeli hostages being held in Gaza in exchange for an Israeli release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Israeli jails. And traditionally, when you look back to former conflicts between Israel and the armed groups in Gaza, there have been ceasefires before. And they would break down often within hours. This time, remarkably, the ceasefire has held. And that’s because at the heart of it is this issue of the release of hostages.

sabrina tavernise

So what is it about the hostages that makes this so historic? Bring me into that deal.

isabel kershner

Well, first of all, for Israel, this was an unprecedented event, to have 240 people taken captive into Gaza. At first, the initial impulse was to fight back, to retaliate. And the Israeli government and military immediately set the war goal as being eradicating Hamas rule and destroying its military capabilities. That was the focus from October the 7th. And to a large extent, it felt like the hostage issue in all the shock and the fog of war was almost taking a secondary role, like a backseat.

sabrina tavernise

Right.

isabel kershner

But the families of the hostages, they, of course, had their own number one priority, which was to bring their loved ones back home. And we saw the beginnings within a week of a grassroots domestic movement, led by the families of hostages, and one father in particular who stands out, Avihai Brodutch, as someone who really kicked this off.

sabrina tavernise

So, Isabel, tell me about Mr. Brodutch and this grassroots movement that he helped start.

isabel kershner

So Avihai Brodutch, he’s a farmer and a student of nursing from a kibbutz, a communal village near the Gaza border called Kfar Aza. [MUSIC PLAYING] On the morning of October the 7th, he saw that the neighbor’s child, a 3-year-old, Avigail Edan, was running around on the lawn, covered in blood after her father had been shot dead. He ran out and brought her into their home and handed her to his wife. And he then went out to get a weapon and start to defend the kibbutz. When he came back home, he found that his family, along with the neighbor’s child Abigail, had all gone. And he didn’t know what had happened. It transpired after a couple of days that they were, indeed, confirmed as having been kidnapped to Gaza.

sabrina tavernise

Wow. So his whole family had been kidnapped, including the little girl that he saved.

isabel kershner

That’s right. His wife, Hagar, and their three children, Ofri, Yuval, and Oriya who are aged 10, 8, and 4, and the neighbor’s little daughter, Avigail Edan.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so what does he do?

isabel kershner

So he was feeling that the hostages were not first and foremost in the government’s mind, that the country was very focused on the fighting in Gaza and revenge. And he was frustrated. And a week after his family was taken, he just went himself overnight, took a plastic chair, sat himself down with the family dog outside the military and government headquarters in Tel Aviv with a cardboard sign that he’d written, which had a very simple message on it, My family is in Gaza. And by the morning, hundreds of supporters who heard about him began to join him.

^crowd^ (chanting)

Bring them home. Bring them home. Bring them home.

isabel kershner

And I think that was really the beginning of the grassroots campaign that we saw grow into a huge force in the country.

speaker 1 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [MUSIC PLAYING]

isabel kershner

Posters of the kidnapped people began appearing all over the country. There’s a square in Tel Aviv in front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and the Opera. And that became the hub of activity of the hostages’ families. So you began to see installations there, like the long table set for a Sabbath meal with 240 empty chairs. And then we saw the families forming delegations to travel abroad and meet with world leaders —

speaker 2 Where is the world? Why is no one crying out for these people to be allowed access to the Red Cross? Why is no one demanding just proof of life? speaker 3 My family, my babies, my wife, they need to get out now. You need to use all your power in order to do so.

isabel kershner

— and speak in front of the European Parliament and go to Geneva and meet with the International Committee of the Red Cross. Another relative of a family that had been taken to Gaza, Yuval Haran, he spearheaded what became a long march, which set out from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

speaker 4 Bring them home now.

^crowd^ (chanting)

Bring them home now.

[non-english call and response from crowd]

speaker 5 Government, do your job.

^crowd^ (chanting)

Government, do your job.

isabel kershner

And by the time they marched into Jerusalem and to the prime minister’s offices, there were thousands of people filling the streets.

sabrina tavernise

So really, kind of a little movement that grows into this moral drumbeat for the country, and one that was really impossible to ignore.

isabel kershner

Absolutely. And I think they captured the hearts of many, many, many Israelis. I mean, we saw a shift. We saw the hostage issue moving from being what at first felt like a secondary issue to the front stage, where the government and the military were then describing it as a dual goal, that this campaign was equally about getting Hamas out of power and bringing the hostages home.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so that’s the domestic pressure on Netanyahu to do something about the hostages. But of course, that’s just one side of the equation here, right? The other side is, of course, the ceasefire. So what was the talk domestically about engaging in a ceasefire? What were Israelis saying?

isabel kershner

Well, there hadn’t been much talk, actually, about a ceasefire. The majority of Israelis were very unified about the need for this war to be fought, that this Hamas assault could not go unanswered. And there was only small, small pockets of people calling for a ceasefire. A ceasefire does come with risks for the military and the government because any pause in the fighting, you’re giving time to Hamas to regroup, kind of a breather for the other side. So there was some debate about whether the ceasefire was a good idea or not. But I think by then, the public pressure to do anything possible to bring at least some of the hostages back alive was the main goal.

sabrina tavernise

There was, of course, another big force at play, which was the United States. We know from our colleagues in Washington that there was significant pressure being put on Israel by the Biden administration on the question of civilian deaths and the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in early November said, quote, “There is more that can and should be done to minimize harm to Palestinian civilians.” So I guess I’m wondering, what role did the US play here exactly in terms of negotiating an actual ceasefire between Israel and Hamas?

isabel kershner

I think it played a critical role. The Biden administration had every interest in some kind of pause. Washington wanted increased aid and fuel to go into Gaza to try and mitigate and ease the humanitarian crisis there and, yes, was becoming increasingly uncomfortable about the spiraling death toll of Palestinians in Gaza, particularly the huge civilian death toll there of women and children. And at the same time, the administration also had another interest in getting hostages out because there are nearly a dozen hostages who are dual US-Israeli citizens. And so there were various interests at play here. And one Israeli former Mossad official who had been responsible in the past for negotiating the return of Israeli MIAs and hostages and is now, in his words, working behind the scenes, he told me that once he saw the involvement of the Americans in reaching this deal, that’s when he knew it was serious.

sabrina tavernise

Interesting. I mean, there is, not to be too political and cynical in terms of the Americans, but, of course, the question of domestic politics in the US for Biden. Parts of the Democratic Party are calling for a ceasefire. Some members of Congress, too, we’re headed into an election season. These are important indicators that I have to imagine the Israelis have been keenly aware of, that the US may not have endless patience for Israel’s war.

isabel kershner

Of course. And Israel can only continue to act at the pace it was acting as long as it has some international legitimacy left for its campaign. And it was clear that that was beginning to wear thin. [MUSIC PLAYING] So what we saw was the Qataris and the Egyptians acting as mediators between Israel and Hamas and the Americans in the background as a very, very strong pressure force to have this deal move ahead. And all of this culminated at 7:00 AM on Friday morning, when the ceasefire came into effect. And then by the evening, you saw the whole country here gripped by these scenes being aired and broadcast on TV of the first group of these hostages being handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza and eventually making their way back into Israel.

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. So, Isabel, we left off in this very dramatic moment. A ceasefire finally begins on Friday morning. And hostages and prisoners are about to be released. So what happens?

isabel kershner

Well, the terms of the deal, as they were announced, was that Israel would get 50 hostages back. The priority or the criteria would be that women and children would be released from captivity. And there was also a principle that children who’d been kidnapped with mothers would come out together with their mothers. And on the side of Hamas, the demand was for three prisoners or detainees to be released from Israeli custody in return for each hostage. So that would be 150 prisoners and detainees. And again, the criteria would be women and minors, teenagers, who had been in Israeli detention.

sabrina tavernise

And, Isabel, were these people who had actually committed crimes on the Palestinian side?

isabel kershner

Well, they were all accused of. Some had been convicted of. Many were teenagers who were detained for throwing stones or people who’d been detained or tried for association with armed groups. Many had not been charged or tried or convicted. But they all were accused of something.

sabrina tavernise

And why are there three times as many Palestinians being released? Like, how did that math work?

isabel kershner

We’ve seen in the past very lopsided prisoner exchanges between Israel and Hamas and other Palestinian groups. So for example, when Hamas captured an Israeli soldier in 2006, Gilad Shalit, and took him into Gaza and kept him captive there for five years, in the end, Israel got him back in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, half of whom had been convicted of deadly terror acts. So in a way, Israel is used to paying more than one for one. And this is what the sides settled for.

sabrina tavernise

So tell us about the releases themselves. How does a hostage physically get out of Gaza?

isabel kershner

What we’ve been seeing since Friday is this nightly drama — [MUSIC PLAYING] — where a list is drawn up and agreed upon by Israel and Hamas. And the list is kept under wraps until it’s confirmed that these people actually are being freed.

speaker 6 Going home. Goodbye. speaker 7 Wake up. speaker 6 Good luck.

isabel kershner

And what happens is the Hamas armed men hand them over in Southern Gaza.

speaker 8 Wake up. [CHIMES] speaker 9 Oh. speaker 8 Wake up. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Wake up. [MUSIC PLAYING]

isabel kershner

So you’ve got these armed fighters, masked, wearing fatigues, handing over these women and children to Red Cross representatives.

speaker 10 The Israeli Army released a video showing the moment a bus carrying hostages released by Hamas crossed back into Israeli territory.

They’re put into Red Cross ambulances or vans and driven across the border into Israel from Egypt — [HORNS HONKING] [CHATTER] — where they received initial checkups to see if anybody needed emergency care. There were a couple of cases of hostages who were helicoptered actually straight to the closest hospital, to the Gaza Strip. One had a leg injury and needed surgery. And the other was an older woman, Elma Avraham, of 84 years old, who actually was in critical condition because she had not been given her heart medication that she needs to survive.

Are there any other stories, Isabel, that stand out to you in terms of the hostages who were released?

isabel kershner

Well, absolutely. There’s the girl Hila. And she’s 11 or 12 years old. But she appeared without her mother. And this was against the guidelines that had been agreed upon, that mothers and children should not be separated. There’s been speculation why her mother Raya did not come out of Gaza with her. It was said at one point that Hamas didn’t know where she was. Hamas doesn’t have all the hostages in its hands. Other armed groups have some of them, that they couldn’t locate her. But since she’s been back in Israel, her relatives, who’ve met with her, have said that, actually, she was being held with her mother. And so we’ve not had any official explanation. And we saw Avihai Brodutch’s family come back. And —

sabrina tavernise

Oh, wow.

isabel kershner

— the pictures just emerged today of his reunion with his wife and his children. And his wife and children came back with Avigail Edan, the neighbor’s daughter.

sabrina tavernise

The little girl.

isabel kershner

The little girl who’d been alone, who’d lost both her parents on October the 7th and had turned 4 in captivity on Friday. So she has captured the hearts of many people here. And she’s been reunited here with her grandmother. And she has two older siblings who survived October the 7th.

sabrina tavernise

And what have the reunions been like?

isabel kershner

Well, very emotional, from what we’ve seen. You know, it’s not just pure joy because many of these hostages who’ve been coming back to Israel have either left people behind in Gaza — so there are mothers with children who have left behind their husbands and the children’s father in Gaza. There are elderly women who’ve left their husbands behind in Gaza and many who’ve come out to find that some of their family members were killed on October the 7th, and they didn’t know that and only learned that as they got back here.

sabrina tavernise

And what about the Palestinian prisoners being released? How did those releases play out?

isabel kershner

So my colleague, Christina Goldbaum, who’s been covering the release of the Palestinian prisoners and detainees, has been describing very vividly the scenes every night in Ramallah — [MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHEERING] — where crowds have gathered outside the detention center where the prisoners and detainees are released from.

speaker 11 [ULULATING]:

isabel kershner

And great joy on that side — [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] — but again, mixed with a kind of sadness and concern because of the high death toll in Gaza.

speaker 12 [CRYING]: speaker 13 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

isabel kershner

Many of the detainees who’ve been coming out are young teens. For example, Christina’s written about Tarek Daoud, who’s 17. So he was accused of throwing stones at Israeli soldiers who were on a military raid in his neighborhood, as well as possession of weapons or explosive devices. But he wasn’t tried yet. And he’d been detained for a year. So his father described to my colleagues how he was glued to his television screen for days, waiting to see if his son Tarek would appear on one of the lists. And finally, his name did come up on Saturday afternoon. So his father drove to meet him in Ramallah and took him back to Qalqilya. And by the time they got there, it was dawn. And dozens of relatives and friends were there to greet him. And they ended up driving around the neighborhood in a 15-car motorcade.

sabrina tavernise

Do we have a sense of how much longer this ceasefire is going to last? Like, what’s going to happen?

isabel kershner

Well, the original deal was for four days, which would end today. But Israel, from the beginning, had proposed that if Hamas could come up with another 10 hostages per day, Israel would be willing to extend the ceasefire or the pause by another day. And that would be up to a total of 100 hostages. So that would be another five days of 10 hostages per day. And at first, we didn’t hear anything. They didn’t publicly respond to that proposition. But suddenly, last night the Hamas leadership announced that they were interested in seeking an extension. And very quickly, by today the sides have agreed to extend for another two days, at least, and see another 20 hostages come back. And that would mean another 60 Palestinian prisoners and detainees released. And I think what we’re going to see is Hamas trying to pull this string as long as it can and try and keep the ceasefire going as long as it can. Now, we’re already hearing the beginnings of reports that Hamas is now willing to begin to negotiate the release of captive soldiers. But it’s difficult to see how as long as Hamas is dangling this proposition of more hostages coming out, it’s difficult to see Netanyahu say, no, that’s enough. We’re going back to the war. So we’ll have to see how it plays out. I think from the perspective of many Israelis, there’s an urgency to getting as many hostages out and that the war can wait.

sabrina tavernise

Isabel, stepping back here, it seems like we’re at this point that in some ways Israel’s government and military was worried about, the point where the ceasefire starts to feel kind of inevitable and longer lasting. So what does this mean for Israel and its mission of eliminating Hamas?

isabel kershner

Well, we saw Netanyahu yesterday actually visiting the troops in Gaza for the first time, taking advantage of the pause. And he pledged to the citizens of Israel and to the soldiers that we will be going back to the war. Israel would continue until victory. And that meant eliminating Hamas rule in Gaza. Now, what that means, people are still not sure or clear about. How do you wipe out Hamas? Are you going to get rid of every single last Hamas fighter with a Kalashnikov? It’s a goal that many people see as a little ambiguous and fuzzy anyway. [MUSIC PLAYING] Nobody’s sure how this is going to end and what comes next. But for the time being, the government and the military are saying that they are absolutely determined at the end of this ceasefire to pick up where they left off.

sabrina tavernise

Isabel, thank you.

10,10,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/us/politics/israel-gaza-war-military.html,"The United States has warned Israel that it must fight more surgically and avoid further mass displacement of Palestinians in its war against Hamas to avoid a humanitarian crisis that overwhelms the world’s ability to respond, according to senior Biden administration officials.

The White House has told Israel that replicating the scale of its bombardment in northern Gaza as it makes an expected push into southern Gaza once the recent pause in fighting ends would produce a crisis beyond the capacity of any humanitarian support network, the officials said on Monday night. The United Nations has said the fighting has already displaced most of Gaza’s population of 2.2 million.

The statements are the Biden administration’s strongest warning to Israeli officials to date about the next phase of their military operation. For weeks, the White House has been careful to say it does not dictate how Israel conducts its military operations, but President Biden and senior members of his staff have grown more vocal as the humanitarian crisis has unfolded.

They also come as the administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues, said they were ramping up humanitarian aid during the cease-fire that took effect late last week, and expressed optimism that aid could continue even when fighting resumed.

Among other things, American officials have told the Israelis that any coming military operations should not hamper the flow of power and water or impede the work of humanitarian sites such as hospitals and U.N.-supported shelters in south and central Gaza.

The Israeli government was receptive to the requests, one official said.

The cease-fire, to allow for the exchange of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinians taken prisoner by Israel, has allowed for the first extended break in the violence since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas gunmen and other militant groups killed an estimated 1,200 people in Israel. Gazan health officials say at least 13,000 people were killed during the nearly 50-day Israeli bombardment and ground invasion that followed.

Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has made clear that he intends for Israel to continue fighting after the truce ends, though it was extended by two more days on Monday. On Tuesday, Hamas released 12 more hostages, including 10 Israelis and two Thai nationals, the Israeli military said.

The Biden administration officials said the United States was taking advantage of the extra time. On Tuesday, a U.S. Air Force C-17 aircraft delivered more than 54,000 pounds of humanitarian supplies, including medicine and food, to neighboring Egypt for distribution to Gazan civilians. The United States is planning additional flights in the coming days, officials said.

“The United States will continue to lead the humanitarian response in Gaza to further support those in desperate need,” the U.S. Agency for International Development said in a statement on Tuesday. It called on other nations to join what it described as a “woefully underfunded” global humanitarian effort.

Administration officials emphasized the extraordinary progress that has been made in aid delivery, though they acknowledged that the level of assistance was still not enough to support normal life in Gaza. The officials also said that the increase in aid, including much-needed fuel, was not contingent on hostage releases, offering hope that the shipments could continue when fighting resumed.

John F. Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said on Monday that since the pause in fighting had taken effect, Gaza had received its largest humanitarian convoy since the war began. The convoy brought the total number of aid trucks to over 2,000 since Oct. 21, he said.

Mr. Kirby said that the administration would “take advantage of every hour of every day that there’s a pause to try to help the people of Gaza.”

“Our team has prioritized getting this much-needed relief into Gaza to alleviate the suffering of Palestinian civilians there,” he said. “Of course, most of them have nothing to do with Hamas.”"
11,11,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hamas-hostages.html,"The deal came after an Israeli offer to continue the cease-fire by one day for every additional 10 hostages released, who would be exchanged for 30 Palestinians in Israeli prisons.

The Israeli hostages released on Monday were three women and eight children, all of them kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas-led assault on Israel on Oct. 7, when more than 200 people were seized and taken to Gaza.

They included Sharon Alony Cunio, 34, and her twin 3-year-old daughters, Emma and Yuli Cunio, three of the six members of their family who were taken hostage. David Cunio, the twins’ father and Ms. Cunio’s husband, is believed to still be in Gaza. Her sister and niece were released on Friday.

The French government said three of those released on Monday were dual Israeli-French citizens. A number of those kidnapped have dual nationalities, including about 10 Israeli-Americans, of whom only one, a 4-year-old girl, has been released.

Hamas said it had received a list of three women and 30 minors that Israel would release in return on Monday.

The exchanges so far have focused on Israeli and Palestinian women and minors. Dozens of Israeli soldiers as well as civilian Israeli men in their 70s and 80s are still being held captive in Gaza. In several cases, children have been released without their fathers, and wives without their husbands.

Family separations have been a stumbling block in the hostage negotiations.

Israeli officials have expressed concerns to Qatari mediators that some children were being released without mothers who were also being held captive, running counter to the agreement, according to an official briefed on the talks. The official said Hamas has said that in those cases, the mothers are being held by different groups, and it would take time to get them.

Late Monday, Israel’s Army Radio, citing the prime minister’s office, reported that the government had received a list of hostages held by Hamas who are expected to be released on Tuesday.

The swap of hostages and prisoners is being negotiated by the government of Qatar, where many of Hamas’s political leaders live, and which has long acted as an intermediary for nations that refuse to deal directly with Hamas."

Hamas and Israel make their 3rd prisoner-hostage exchange

Hamas released 17 more hostages yesterday, including one American — Avigail Idan, who turned 4 on Friday, nearly seven weeks after her parents were killed in the Oct. 7 cross-border assault on southern Israel.

Here’s what we know about the hostages.

The Israeli prime minister’s office said that 14 Israelis, including nine children, and three foreigners were released on the third day of the negotiated cease-fire. The terms of the deal — which began on Friday and involves the release of 50 hostages in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and minors in Israeli custody — has allowed for the longest break in fighting in Gaza since Oct. 7. It is slated to end on Tuesday.

Israel has offered to extend the pause by one day for every additional 10 hostages released, and Hamas later announced that it was seeking to extend the truce as well.

Here’s the latest.

Delays: Hamas threatened on Saturday to postpone the second trade, claiming that Israel had not allowed enough aid to reach northern Gaza. After an hourslong delay, the exchange went ahead, and Israel released 39 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The delay raised fears that subsequent releases would be similarly fraught."
14,14,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/23/world/europe/israel-hamas-ceasefire.html,"Israeli forces said on Thursday that they had detained the director of Al-Shifa Hospital, Dr. Mohammad Abu Salmiya, for questioning “following evidence showing that the Al-Shifa Hospital, under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control center.”

And on both sides of the border, families of the captives waited with terrible trepidation, counting down the hours, hoping their loved ones might be among those released and that nothing at the last minute would go wrong.

The family of Avigail Idan, a small child whose parents were murdered in front of their children by Hamas militants at a kibbutz during the Oct. 7 assault, hoped that they would be able to celebrate her fourth birthday with her on Friday.

“I find myself barely breathing through the last 24 hours,” her aunt, Tal Idan, said after the announcement of the agreement. “Every hour that goes by feels like forever.”

White House officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the five weeks of sensitive negotiations that had led to the agreement, said on Tuesday that they expected the final list of 50 hostages to to include the release of three Americans: two women and the child, Avigail, whose name has also been spelled “Abigail” in the U.S. media and who is a dual Israeli and U.S. citizen. But it wasn’t clear if they would be released in the first group on Friday.

In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where the Israeli military has been carrying out nightly raids, the siblings of Walaa Tanji, 26, began frantically preparing for her arrival when they heard she might be released from an Israeli jail. Having already had their hopes dampened the previous day, they nevertheless arranged to bring family members and rented plastic chairs to accommodate the crowds.

Israel detained Ms. Tanji over a year ago at her home in the Balata refugee camp on the outskirts of Nablus, along with two other women. Israel’s military accused the three of planning an attack on an Israeli checkpoint and said it had found firearms in a car they were using. Nagham Tanji, Walaa’s older sister, said that her sister was innocent and that she had yet to be charged or sentenced.

And in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians who have endured nearly seven weeks of intense airstrikes waited anxiously for the truce.

“I will live in safety, even if it’s temporary and short, without hearing explosions near or far,” Shadi Hijazi, a 23-year-old construction worker, said in a phone interview.

Qatar announced it would send a plane loaded with 41 tons of aid to the Gaza Strip, where an estimated 2.2 million Palestinians desperately need humanitarian aid and are running short of water, food and medicine. Several international humanitarian organizations said the four-day cease-fire window was too tight to address the dire situation.

The executive director of UNICEF, Catherine Russell, told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday that the organization was “positioned to quickly scale up the delivery of desperately needed humanitarian aid in Gaza.” But, she said, “this is far from enough” to meet the growing needs of Palestinians."

17,17,https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000009204510/blinken-israel-defense.html,"In my meetings today with the prime minister and senior Israeli officials, I made clear that before Israel resumes major military operations, it must put in place humanitarian civilian protection plans that minimize further casualties of innocent Palestinians. But Israel has the most sophisticated, one of the most sophisticated militaries in the world. It is capable of neutralizing the threat posed by Hamas while minimizing harm to innocent men, women and children. And it has an obligation to do. So the way Israel defends itself matters. It’s imperative that Israel act in accordance with international humanitarian law and the laws of war."
18,18,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-return-home.html,"It was a poignant moment for many. In the Hamas-led assault of Oct. 7 in southern Israel, armed assailants surged across the border from Gaza and killed about 1,200 people, the majority of them civilians, according to Israeli officials — making it the deadliest day in Israel’s 75-year-history. The assailants also took about 240 more as captives into the Palestinian coastal enclave.

“It is permitted to feel joy and also to shed a tear. That’s human,” said Yoni Asher, 37, in a video recording soon after he was reunited with his wife, Doron Katz Asher, 34, and their daughters, Raz, 4, and Aviv, 2. Ms. Katz Asher and the girls were kidnapped while visiting Ms. Katz Asher’s mother in Nir Oz, a pastoral kibbutz, or communal village, near the Gaza border.

“But I am not celebrating and I won’t celebrate until the last of the hostages are returned,” Mr. Asher said, adding, “From today, the families of the hostages are my new family.”

Many Israelis stayed glued to television screens all afternoon and evening, catching first glimpses of those being released through the windows of the Red Cross ambulances transporting them across the border from Gaza into Egypt, then watching their first steps as they emerged from captivity into freedom. The Israeli authorities only confirmed their identities once they had been liberated.

Astonished, the nation watched as Hanna Katzir, 76, a grandmother of six from Kibbutz Nir Oz who usually uses a walker, was helped on unsteady feet out of an ambulance.

Islamic Jihad, an armed Palestinian group that participated in the Oct. 7 assault, had recently claimed that Ms. Katzir died in captivity, and said it would provide evidence but never did.

Even Ms. Katzir’s relatives were surprised to hear that she was alive when the Israeli authorities informed them late Thursday that she was on the list to be freed on Friday, according to a niece, Dalit Katzenellenbogen.

Echoing the mixed feelings of many, Ms. Katzenellenbogen said soon after her aunt’s release that she felt “happiness for Hanna’s return from captivity but also concern about her physical and mental health.”

Like many of the hostages, Ms. Katzir, the daughter of Holocaust survivors, is returning to a very different life. Her husband, Rami Katzir, was killed in the attack on Nir Oz. Her son, Elad, 47, was also kidnapped and remains in Gaza. And like all the residents of the ravaged communities along the border, Ms. Katzir will have no home to go back to for the foreseeable future.

Twelve of the 13 Israeli hostages freed on Friday had been seized from Nir Oz. The 13th was one of five taken from Nirim, another kibbutz along the Gaza border.

Nir Oz was one of the worst hit communities. About a quarter of its roughly 400 residents were killed or abducted.

At a hotel in Eilat where many of the residents of Nir Oz are staying, after their evacuation from the border area, elation was tempered by a wider feeling of loss.

“There are kids here without parents, parents without kids, and grandparents with grandchildren but no parents,” said Larry Butler, 73, a Nir Oz resident who survived the attack.

Founded by the pioneers of socialist labor Zionism in 1955, seven years after the establishment of the state of Israel, the wheat and potato fields of Nir Oz stretch up to the security fence that Israel constructed around the Palestinian coastal enclave, and that was breached in about 30 locations on Oct. 7. Beyond the fence rise the apartment buildings, water towers and minarets of the Palestinian village of Abasan.

Elad Katzir was born in Nir Oz. A farmer in charge of irrigation systems and a member of the kibbutz’s fire crew and emergency team, he had long felt unprotected. After a deadly Israeli three-week offensive against Hamas in Gaza in response to Palestinian rocket fire, which ended in January of 2009 with a shaky cease-fire, he had a nagging feeling of something missed or incomplete.

Driving through the lush fields that month with this reporter, he would only stop the car behind clumps of trees or bushes as cover in case of sniper fire.

“I do not feel any victory,” Mr. Katzir said at the time. “I still do not feel safe.”

Ms. Katzenellenbogen, his cousin, who lives in Tel Aviv, said on Friday night that she remained concerned for Mr. Katzir and the other captives still in Gaza, and noted that Israeli soldiers were on the ground there.

“I hope the war will end soon,” she added, “for the Israelis and for the Palestinians who do not support Hamas.”

“We will have to learn how to keep living next to each other,” she said. “No one is going to disappear.”

19,19,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/arts/hunter-college-film-israel.html,"Hunter College has agreed to reschedule a screening of a documentary critical of Israel, following an outcry from faculty members and students who claimed that the administration’s earlier decision to cancel it violated academic freedom.

A screening of the documentary, “Israelism,” had been scheduled for Nov. 14 as part of a film series organized by a professor in the New York school’s film and media department. It would have been followed by a discussion with one of the directors and one of the film’s protagonists, a young American Jew who travels to Israel and the West Bank and discovers a reality very different from the story she was raised with.

But that morning, Hunter’s interim president, Ann Kirschner, announced that the screening would be canceled because of safety concerns.

“In the current climate, we seek to balance our commitment to free speech and academic freedom with the danger of antisemitic and divisive rhetoric,” Kirschner said in a statement."
20,20,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/26/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-netanyahu-gaza.html,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel visited his country’s troops in the Gaza Strip on Sunday, three days into a pause in fighting there, and vowed that “we are continuing until the end — until victory.”

“Nothing will stop us,” he said in a video statement in which he wore protective gear and was surrounded by Israeli soldiers.

It was not immediately clear exactly when Mr. Netanyahu conducted his visit — information about the trip was withheld by the government until he had exited the Palestinian enclave — or precisely where he was, although he most likely traveled to the northern part of Gaza Strip, where the Israeli military has established control.

The trip was Mr. Netanyahu’s first to Gaza since the Israeli ground invasion began almost a month ago, according to officials. Those who traveled with him included his national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi; his military secretary, Maj. Gen. Avi Gil; and the Israeli military’s deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Amir Baram.

Photographs released by the Israeli government showed Mr. Netanyahu — wearing a T-shirt, jeans and a khaki flak jacket and helmet — looking at a map, consulting with commanders and standing just inside a tunnel that his office said the Israeli military had recently exposed.

The pause, which began on Friday, is part of a deal that includes the release by Hamas of at least 50 Israeli hostages in exchange for at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and increased aid for Gaza. Israel has offered to extend the pause by one day for every additional 10 hostages released. Hamas announced on Sunday evening, after Mr. Netanyahu’s visit, that it was seeking to extend the truce, which was slated to end on Tuesday.

“We are making every effort to bring back our hostages and eventually we will return them all,” Mr. Netanyahu said. Israeli officials have said about 240 people were taken to Gaza as hostages by Hamas and its allies on Oct. 7 in an attack that also killed about 1,200 people.

Some analysts have argued that the longer the cease-fire, the harder it may be for Israel to go back to fighting. But the prime minister emphasized that rooting out Hamas remained a central objective for Israel.

“We have three goals in this war: Eliminate Hamas, return all of our hostages and ensure that Gaza will not go back to being a threat to the state of Israel,” he said.

He added: “We are convinced that we have the force, the strength, the will and the determination to achieve all of our goals for the war.”"
21,21,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/us/politics/israel-aid-senate.html,"The disagreements among Democrats simmered behind closed doors on Capitol Hill and at the White House on Tuesday. At the White House, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, huddled with roughly 20 Democratic senators who have raised concerns about how Israel might use U.S. assistance on the battlefield. Later, at a private party lunch in the Capitol, several of the same Democrats argued to their colleagues that any aid package should increase humanitarian assistance to Gaza and ensure that Israel do more to avoid civilian casualties.

“We want the president to secure express assurances from the Netanyahu government regarding a plan to reduce the unacceptable level of civilian casualties, and we want the Netanyahu coalition to commit to full cooperation with our efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen, the Maryland Democrat leading the effort, referring to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. “The bottom line is we need those express assurances. How we achieve that is something that we are discussing right now.”

Mr. Van Hollen spearheaded a letter this month to President Biden that was signed by half of the Democratic caucus and raised concerns about whether the weapons provided by the United States would be used in keeping with international law.

The Biden administration has requested $14.3 billion for Israel’s war effort against Hamas as part of a sweeping national security package that includes additional billions to speed humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip.

No Democrats have said they would not back the package. But several have worried that if left unchecked, Israel’s use of heavier, U.S.-supplied offensive weapons funded by a fresh infusion of American money could undermine efforts to minimize Palestinian casualties and distribute help to civilians under bombardment."
22,22,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/nyregion/hillcrest-high-school-jewish-teacher-protest.html,"New York City officials are investigating after hundreds of Queens high school students protested against a pro-Israel teacher, who was moved to another part of the building during the demonstration, the schools chancellor said Monday.

The recent episode at Hillcrest High School erupted after the teacher, who is Jewish, had changed a social media profile photo to an image of her holding up an “I Stand With Israel” sign, the chancellor, David C. Banks, said. On Nov. 20, as roughly 400 teenagers roamed the school in between class periods, the teacher was moved to a different floor, Mr. Banks said.

Mr. Banks said the teacher had been targeted for her backing of Israel and for “expressing her Jewish identity,” adding that it was “completely unacceptable.”

After TikTok clips of the raucous scene gained online attention and The New York Post published a story reporting that the teacher had hidden in a locked office, the events at the southeast Queens school became the latest high-profile flashpoint in the tensions over the Israel-Hamas war that have rocked public school districts and college campuses.

But on Monday, Mr. Banks said there had been “many rumors and misinformation” about what happened. The teacher “was never in direct danger” or barricaded into a room, he said, but was moved to a different floor of the building when the protest began.

“Violence, hate and disorder have no place in our schools,” Mr. Banks, who himself attended Hillcrest in the 1970s, said at a news conference.

Still, the chancellor also called for a measure of understanding, saying the war was a “very visceral and emotional issue” at Hillcrest, where about 30 percent of students are Muslim. “They feel a kindred spirit with the folks of the Palestinian community,” Mr. Banks said, adding that the “notion that these kids are radicalized” was irresponsible.

Within hours of first reports of the incident last week, Mayor Eric Adams condemned the episode as a “vile show of antisemitism.” Melinda Katz, the borough’s district attorney and a Hillcrest alumna, said it “both angers me and breaks my heart to see young people using violence to try to silence” supporters of Israel. And one Republican city councilwoman called for Hillcrest to “be shut down pending a full and thorough investigation.”

The incident at Hillcrest was a stark example of just how fraught the fallout from the war has been for school communities across the nation.

At times, videos of students marching through campuses or banging on classroom doors have gone viral — setting off swift firestorms. In San Francisco, for example, students said their peers and administrators had their personal information published online after a short clip of teenagers shouting “Palestine will be free from the river to the sea” during a school rally was viewed more than 17 million times on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

In New York City, the initial reports on the episode at Hillcrest — a large high school of roughly 2,500 students in Jamaica, Queens — were met with immediate criticisms from officials. The teacher who was targeted has not spoken publicly. She was not at the school on Monday, officials said, but is expected to return later this week.

Many local politicians said they worried that intolerance and antisemitism had been allowed to impede her from doing her job. “What’s going on overseas is not license for anyone to hate,” Eric Dinowitz, who leads the City Council’s Jewish caucus, said at a rally earlier on Monday that had been organized to respond to the Hillcrest incident. “We do not have a Department of Education that is acting with the urgency of the moment.”

Mr. Adams said in a statement on Saturday that the incident was “motivated by ignorance-fueled hatred, plain and simple.”

“It will not be tolerated in any of our schools, let alone anywhere else in our city,” the mayor added. “We are better than this.”

School officials said some of the students involved in the protest had received suspensions for their conduct, though the officials were barred from discussing individual cases.

On Monday, Mr. Banks and other city leaders attempted to quell the mounting online backlash against students at the school. On social media, some commenters had begun labeling the teenagers as terrorists or criminals and demanded harsh penalties for the full student body.

“To speak of every child in this school as antisemitic is simply wrong,” said Donovan Richards, the Queens borough president.

He added in an interview that because the Department of Education had not addressed the war in the Middle East head on, “you had this powder keg waiting to explode.”

In the aftermath of the incident, Hillcrest also attracted attention for other recent issues at the school — some of which the chancellor said had also been portrayed incorrectly online. A week earlier, four teenagers had been taken into police custody after they fought in school and injured several school safety agents, the police said. Mr. Banks said the brawl was “completely unrelated” to the incident last Monday.

Another 18-year-old student was also charged with aggravated harassment and making a threat of mass harm on Nov. 21, but the school’s principal said that it was also unconnected to the protest the previous day.

Outside Hillcrest on Monday, more than a dozen police officers and school safety agents stood on the front steps. In interviews, a half-dozen students, who asked that their names not be published, shared mixed feelings about what had taken place. Several were frustrated over how their school had been portrayed online. One called the episode unacceptable and said he worries for his safety if other incidents occur.

Most of the teenagers said they believed that while some of their peers sought to protest the teacher’s post and express support for Palestinians, many of their classmates participated because they wanted to have fun or were curious about the commotion.

In interviews, students, teachers and local politicians briefed by the authorities on the demonstration described a chaotic scene during the protest, which occurred in the middle of the school day on Nov. 20. They also noted that student organizers had been making plans for a rally days before it occurred.

Around 11 a.m., some of the organizers sent out a message telling their peers the protest was on.

Hundreds of teenagers filled the school’s third floor — and many did not return to classrooms when the 11:11 a.m. bell rang for their next class. Some waved Palestinian flags, and one carried a large microphone. Others rushed toward the classroom of the Jewish teacher, who was removed and taken to another section of the building. At around 11:20 a.m., school safety agents contacted their sergeant, asking for help with a “disorderly group of students.”

About 25 officers were sent to help, and all of the teenagers eventually returned to their classrooms, police officials said.

One student later warned a teacher that the protests would continue as long as the teacher remained on staff — and on Nov. 22, the school was placed under lockdown as rumors spread of another planned demonstration.

Two teachers at the school, who spoke on condition of anonymity since they were not authorized to speak publicly, said they believed their school mishandled its response to the initial incident.

Some Hillcrest students had openly discussed their plans in the lead-up to Nov. 20, the two teachers said. By the weekend beforehand, they said, the Jewish teacher had learned she could be a target and informed a union representative and the principal.

But those details were not shared with the full staff, the two teachers said, adding that they felt blindsided when chaos erupted. Both said they wished for more robust communication. And they questioned whether the protest could be have been better controlled with more preparation.

Muhammad Ghazali, the student government president for the school’s senior class, said at the news conference he was disappointed with how the events unfolded, adding that the “entire Hillcrest community was hurt and broken” because of how some students behaved.

“It didn’t turn out the way it should have been,” he said. “It was meant to be a peaceful protest from the very beginning. But some of these students lack maturity.”"
23,23,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/world/middleeast/israel-hostage-deal-families.html,"The deal for a hostage release brought both hope and agony on Wednesday to families of captives held in Gaza.

Uncertainty over the agreement — including over who would be among at least 50 hostages set to be released, and whether more would follow — was straining the emotions of relatives who have campaigned for the release of their loved ones in the 46 days since they were abducted during the Hamas assault on southern Israel.

Israel has said that about 240 people were taken hostage to Gaza, and it remained unclear which of them would be released under the cease-fire deal announced overnight. Cease-fires in previous conflicts between Israel and Hamas have proven fragile.

Hours after the deal was announced, families said they had received no official information from the Israeli authorities. The government said in a statement that women and children would be released, raising the possibility that families could be separated — for example, by leaving behind fathers who were taken captive with their children. At least 36 Israeli civilians ages 18 and under are being held in Gaza along with 13 of their mothers.

“I am feeling like yesterday and the day before, only worse,” said Yael Engel Lichi, the aunt of Ofir Engel, a 12th grader from Jerusalem who was kidnapped on Oct. 7 from Kibbutz Be’eri, where he was staying with his girlfriend, Yuval Sharabi, 17, and her family.

People have been calling to congratulate the family since Tuesday night, Ms. Engel Lichi said on Wednesday morning. But, she added, “We don’t know anything. No official has been in touch to tell us anything.”

“We are on the point of collapse,” she added."

26,26,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/23/nyregion/thanksgiving-israel-war-jewish-families.html,"There will be turkey at Marci Rosa’s family Thanksgiving in New Jersey, and stuffing and sweet potato and leek gratin. But also kasha varnishkes, a Jewish grain dish with roots in Eastern Europe, where her in-laws survived the Holocaust.

All across the country, families like Ms. Rosa’s are gathering on Thursday to nosh, to catch up and perhaps to bicker a little. But this year, with Israel at war and the world sharply divided over questions of justice, some Jewish families are finding that what it means to be a Jew is also on the Thanksgiving table.

Seated around one table will be members of a family whose stances toward Israel since the Hamas terrorist attacks on Oct. 7 and the Israeli military response have sent them to different ideological poles.

At one end is Ms. Rosa’s mother, Esther Rosa, 95, who recalls Thanksgivings during World War II with one seat left empty — her brother was fighting for the United States against the Germans — and is steadfast in her belief in Israel’s right to defend itself. At the other is her daughter, Becca Gertler, 25, who is outspoken in her support for the Palestinians, thousands of whom have been killed in the war. Somewhere in the middle is Ms. Rosa herself, a self-described liberal from Brooklyn who is in her 60s, and who regularly criticized Israel’s policies in the past, but now sees it — and Jews like her — as under threat.

Though the family is no stranger to heated debates, according to Ms. Rosa’s nephew, who is hosting the dinner, this kind of tension is new. “With my family, with politics we kind of know where those lines were drawn years ago; you know what to say if you want to press someone’s buttons,” said the nephew, who asked that his name not be used because of the contentiousness of the subject.

“You are going into a family dinner with a polarizing topic, not knowing where anybody stands,” he said. “I don’t think we’ve ever done that — I don’t think any family has ever done that.”

Raging family debates at Thanksgiving are as traditional as cranberry sauce. For generations, Americans have sat down to dinner divided over politics and taxes, Republicans and Democrats, the Giants and the Jets. At a time when things like protests against Israel’s policies and the tearing down of missing persons signs can feel like personal attacks, some American Jews are experiencing the revelation of differing values across the family Thanksgiving table with acute pain.

These types of identity- and values-based conflicts are the most intractable, according to Tricia S. Jones, a professor at Temple University and director of the Center for Conflict Management and Media Impact there. “They are so much a definition of who we are and need to be that it is very difficult for us to accept an alternate story from anyone — particularly from those we love,” she said.

Dr. Jones added: “You’ve got people who deeply love one another, and want to understand where their loved ones are coming from, so pretending away the differences and the pain also isn’t workable.”

There are 21 members of the extended Rosa family coming for Thanksgiving, but one matriarch will be absent: Judith Gertler, 89, Ms. Rosa’s mother-in-law, a Holocaust survivor who endured the Ravensbrück concentration camp in Germany as a little girl, and who lives in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. She has dementia and is too frail to make the trip to New Jersey. With the support of Mrs. Gertler’s doctor, the family has kept all news of the Oct. 7 attack from her. She found refuge in Israel after the war, Ms. Rosa said, and the family was afraid the news would trigger post-traumatic stress."
27,27,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/26/world/middleeast/freed-israeli-hostages-captivity.html,"A mother released from captivity in Gaza with her young son told relatives that they had slept on chairs pushed together. An 85-year-old grandmother from a different family described counting the days to keep track of time.

On Sunday, two days after the first group of 13 hostages was released and brought back to Israel, details began to emerge of the nearly 50 days they and others released on Saturday spent as captives of armed groups in the Palestinian enclave, via conversations with relatives.

The freed hostages have not spoken directly to the news media and most are still being treated in private areas of Israeli hospitals. Much of the information about where, and how, they were held remains classified.

Relatives who have spoken or met with some of the released hostages said all seemed to have spent their weeks in captivity totally cut off from the outside world, and to have returned thinner than before.

“They were eating, but not regularly and not all of the time,” said Merav Mor Raviv, a cousin of Keren Munder, 54, who was released on Friday along with her son, Ohad Munder-Zichri, 9, and her mother, Ruth Munder, 78. “They ate a lot of rice and bread,” Ms. Raviv said, adding that Keren told her that both she and her mother had lost about 6 to 8 kilograms, or 13 to 18 pounds.

Ms. Raviv related that the Munders had slept in a reception room on improvised benches they fashioned by pushing three chairs together, and that when they wanted to go to the bathroom they would have to knock on a door and wait — sometimes for up to two hours.

Adva Adar’s grandmother, Yaffa Adar, 85, was among the hostages released on Friday. She noted that her grandmother had lost weight and was aware that she had been held for nearly 50 days because she had kept count.

Ms. Raviv and Adva Adar spoke to reporters on Sunday via a video call organized by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a nongovernmental group set up to support the hostages and their families, and Media Central, an Israeli nonprofit group that provides services to journalists.

In an indication of how isolated the hostages were, Ms. Raviv said, Ruth Munder learned only after being released that her son, Roi, had been killed during the Oct. 7 assault.

But the Munders also received some better news. Ms. Raviv said that Ruth had assumed her husband, Avraham Munder, was killed in the attacks but was told upon her release that he had survived and been taken separately to Gaza.

Ms. Raviv said the Munders “didn’t have a clue” about the public campaign for their release and the fact that their faces and names are now known all over Israel.

The uncle of two hostages who were among those freed late Saturday — Noam Or, 17, and his sister Alma, 13 — told the BBC on Sunday that they, too, were unaware until their release that their mother, Yonat Or, had been killed in the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks.

“They have some difficult stories to tell of the way they were captured and treated,” Ahal Besorai said of his nephew and niece. He said he had spoken with them on a video call at the hospital where they are staying.

The Or siblings were taken hostage with their father, Dror, who is believed to still be held in Gaza. Mr. Besorai said Noam and Alma were held separately from their father."
28,28,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/nyregion/new-york-coffee-shop-israel.html,"For several days this month, New Yorkers stood in a line that snaked down Lexington Avenue and around the corner of East 71st Street, waiting up to 90 minutes to order a drink at Caffè Aronne. Members of the city’s Jewish community, spurred by messages on social media, turned out in droves to support a coffee shop owner who had said that his employees had walked out to protest the company’s support for Israel during the war with Hamas.

The cafe’s owner, Aaron Dahan, 25, stood on the sidewalk on Nov. 7, reflecting on the spectacle that had unfolded. “Our morning shift decided to come in, unlock the store, open up and leave,” he said. “Put us in a bit of a pickle.”

The story was two things at once: a display of solidarity but also an illustration of the current divide in a city that is shaped by both its progressive ideals and its Jewish culture. It was irresistible fodder for Instagram and beyond. The Daily Mail wrote about it, as did The Jerusalem Post. A few days later, a first-person essay under Mr. Dahan’s byline was published in The New York Post with the headline: “All of N.Y.C. helped when my pro-Hamas staff quit Caffe Aronne.”

But the initial accounts of what happened between the staff and the owner of the Upper East Side coffee shop were not the whole story. On the day that the conflict burst into public view, just one of two scheduled morning-shift workers walked out. The other stayed and made espresso drinks for hours. As the situation went viral on social media, other staffers resigned.

Interviews with five former employees, and a review of text and email messages, indicate that employees were uncomfortable with the way that their boss, who lost a family member in the violent Hamas incursion on Oct. 7, had turned their workplace into what they described as a “political space.” Suddenly, just by showing up for work, they said they were being forced to align with one side of a divisive conflict that some of them knew little about.

They said the owner was insensitive to the safety concerns that followed his displaying fund-raising fliers, Israeli flags and posters of kidnapped Israelis. At least one woman, working alone at night, said she was harassed by customers angered by the display; others reported a variety of uncomfortable interactions with customers about the war.

Now, the cafe’s former employees say they are stunned to be accused of supporting Hamas and terrorism. They said they are worried about being recognized in the neighborhood and are disappointed by their dramatic break from an employer whom most of them had liked and respected.

Mr. Dahan disputes their accounts. “It’s a very simple story,” he said. “It’s a Zionist, pro-Israel man who owns a coffee shop with a staff whose political views and morals didn’t align.”

He also accused some of his former employees of harboring antisemitic views. “Somebody on the staff told me the signs in the window, the hostage signs, are all artificial intelligence that the Israelis and Jews put together in order to justify the killing of babies,” he said.

Last week, Terrence Oved, a lawyer for Caffè Aronne, said in a statement that Mr. Dahan believed the cafe’s former employees had made a “deliberate attempt to inflict maximum financial damage on Caffè Aronne and force it to close in retaliation for proudly displaying the Israeli flag and standing firmly with its people.”

“It backfired,” the statement said. “What started as a setback ended as a setup for an astonishing display of solidarity, love and support.”

In many ways, Caffè Aronne has become an unlikely microcosm of a city where tensions over the war are palpable — in mass protests and smaller daily interactions — and where well-intentioned discussion can veer quickly into angry ideological debate.

Paul Gastelum, 22, had worked for Mr. Dahan for nearly a year. He said the two men were in discussions about the possibility of Mr. Gastelum’s helping to open a Caffè Aronne outpost in his hometown of Tucson, Ariz., when he quit earlier this month. “I always knew that something positive would happen to bring the community into the cafe,” he said. “But it came at the expense of us being labeled something completely false.”"
29,29,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/world/middleeast/israeli-raid-two-children-dead-jenin.html,"Two children were shot dead by Israeli soldiers during a raid in the city of Jenin in the northern West Bank, on Wednesday, the Palestinian health ministry and a local official said.

The Palestinian Authority’s news agency, Wafa, said the two were Adam al-Ghoul, 8, and Basil Abu al-Wafa, 15.

Mohammed Sabbagh, the head of a leadership council in Jenin, said two members of armed groups were also killed during a raid by Israeli forces that began Tuesday night. Mr. Sabbagh said Israeli forces had surrounded the gunmen’s homes before they were killed. He added that Israeli forces had been searching homes in some parts of the area raided. That area, known as the Jenin refugee camp, was established in 1953 to house Palestinians displaced in the founding of Israel, and has become an urban environment known for fierce opposition to Israel.

Asked to comment on the raid, the Israeli military said “a number of suspects hurled explosive devices” toward its soldiers. “The soldiers responded with live fire toward the suspects and hits were identified,” it added.

Wafa said that Israeli forces had also made a number of arrests at the camp, and that the Israeli forces’ bulldozers had demolished some infrastructure, including water, electricity and sewage networks.

Israeli forces also killed seven Palestinians, including two minors and at least one gunman, in the occupied West Bank over the weekend, Reuters reported. The Israeli military said in a statement at the time that “five terrorists have been eliminated” and that it had detained 21 people.

Tensions have risen in the West Bank since Hamas launched terrorist attacks from Gaza, the Palestinian territory it controls, on Oct. 7, in which 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel and roughly 240 were taken hostage, according to Israeli officials. Israel retaliated with bombardments and a ground invasion in Gaza, and more than 13,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gazan health authorities.

Since Oct. 7, Israeli security forces have carried out daily raids in the occupied West Bank and increased restrictions on Palestinian residents in some areas of the territory. Violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers in the West Bank has also reached record highs, according to the United Nations. Israeli forces have arrested hundreds of Palestinians, according to Palestinian and Israeli accounts.

30,30,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-prisoners-deal.html,"After more than six weeks of war, the Israeli government and Hamas announced Wednesday morning that they would uphold a brief cease-fire in Gaza to allow for the release of 50 hostages Hamas captured during its assault last month on Israel.

The decision, first announced by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office in a WhatsApp message, includes a pause of at least four days in the fighting in Gaza. If it holds, it would be the longest halt in hostilities since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks prompted Israel to begin its bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza.

“The Israeli government is committed to the return of all abductees home,” the government said. It added: “Tonight, the government approved the outline for the first stage of achieving this goal, according to which at least 50 abductees — women and children — will be released for four days, during which there will be a lull in the fighting. The release of every 10 additional abductees will result in an additional day of respite.”

In its own statement on Telegram, Hamas affirmed the deal, saying, “After many days of difficult and complex negotiations, we announce, with the help and blessing of God, that we have reached a humanitarian truce.”

Hamas added that the 50 Israelis would be freed in exchange for the release of 150 Palestinian women and detainees under 19 held in Israeli jails.

I’m Thomas Friedman, and I’m the Foreign Affairs columnist of The New York Times. And I’ve been here since 1981. [MUSIC PLAYING] I’ve just spent nine days in Israel and traveling through part of the West Bank, just to try to understand what’s been the political and strategic impact of Hamas’s onslaught on Israeli settlements on October 7. On the last night I was there, I was watching the news basically through my phone and saw that Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Gallant were giving a press conference.

archived recording (benjamin netanyahu) [SPEAKING NON-ENGLISH]:

thomas friedman

And the headline that came out of the press conference was that Netanyahu was saying Israel will control Gaza after this war and that there’ll be no room for the Palestinian Authority, which has been Israel’s partner in controlling the West Bank since the Oslo Accords were signed.

archived recording (benjamin netanyahu) [SPEAKING NON-ENGLISH]:

thomas friedman

What Netanyahu is saying, if you strip it away, is that 7 million Israeli Jews will control 5 million Palestinians, 3 million in the West Bank roughly and 2 million in Gaza, in perpetuity. And that is not sustainable, except under political conditions that would rhyme with apartheid. So I thought, wow. It only took a couple of days for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to completely reject Secretary of State Blinken and the American vision. Earlier that week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to reporters in a news conference in New Delhi, India, and laid out, really, for the first time, some kind of political horizon that the United States feels has to be part and parcel of the conclusion of this conflict whenever it will come.

archived recording (antony blinken) No forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, no use of Gaza as a platform for launching terrorism or other attacks against Israel, no diminution of the territory of Gaza, and a commitment to Palestinian led governance for Gaza and for the West Bank and in a unified way.

thomas friedman

And so this was a pretty big, titanic clash between the United States vision and the Israeli vision. And as I stood in line at El Al to fly home, that was all I was thinking about. How is this story going to end? I was relieved when President Biden laid out an American vision for two states, for two people, putting a political horizon out there in an essay in the Washington Post. And President Biden understood that for America to continue its support for Israel’s military operation in Gaza, the United States has to be articulating its own vision and encouraging Israel to have a vision for the morning after that gets us back to the idea of two states for two people. Now, no one thinks this is going to happen overnight or in one giant leap. There’s going to have to be a process where the Palestinian Authority does have to be upgraded in its military, its policing capacity, its institutional capacity. And there has to be a framework based on 1967 boundaries for Israel and Palestinians negotiating how this two-state solution would come about where Palestinians are able to assume greater and greater self-rule consistent with Israel’s security and consistent with what surely will have to be land swaps where the block of Israeli settlements already existing in the West Bank will be transferred to Israel ultimately in return for Israeli territory of equal size being transferred to Palestinians. So I just think it’s time for the United States to be saying to Israel, we’re going to help you militarily, but we do not want to see another nail, another piece of lumber, another yard of cement being poured for a new settlement in the West Bank. And if there’s part of that sentence you don’t understand, come back to us and we’ll clear it up. We are tired of you, with one hand, asking for our security assistance and, with the other, building settlements that are designed to basically make it impossible for the very two-state solution that we think you need that we certainly need as your ally and your Arab partners need. Netanyahu is on record supporting an American concept of a two-state solution, and also a vision of Gaza that says if Hamas is gone, Israel would actually expand Gaza by giving it land in the Israeli Negev Desert. A lot of this was laid out in former President Donald Trump’s own peace plan back in 2020.

archived recording (donald trump) I delivered to Prime Minister Netanyahu my vision for peace, prosperity, and a brighter future for the Israelis and Palestinians. archived recording (benjamin netanyahu) Mr. President, I believe your peace plan strikes the right balance where other plans have failed. I’ve agreed to negotiate peace with the Palestinians on the basis of your peace plan.

33,33,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/world/middleeast/hamas-tunnel-al-shifa-hospital-gaza.html,"The Israeli military sought on Wednesday to bolster its assertions that Hamas uses tunnels beneath Gaza’s largest hospital, releasing a series of videos that it said showed “dozens of meters of a tunnel system” beneath the complex of Al-Shifa Hospital.

Israeli and American officials have said that Hamas uses hospitals to provide cover for its military operations, accusations that Hamas and hospital administrators have denied. Israel, under increasing international pressure to prove those claims, has released several videos to press its case, showing elements of its cautious exploration of underground structures the military identifies as Hamas tunnels. The videos so far — including those released on Wednesday — have not shown conclusive evidence of a vast network of tunnels.

One video released this month included a military spokesman showing weapons that he said were found at Al-Shifa. Another showed a section of a tunnel that The New York Times verified was recorded at Al-Shifa.

That tunnel resembled the one seen in a video released on Wednesday. In that video, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, is shown holding a flashlight as he and a group of soldiers traverse a tunnel with an arched ceiling that he describes as being underneath Al-Shifa’s complex.

The videos released on Wednesday also show at least two toilets, a small alcove with a sink and a room with exposed wiring. Admiral Hagari says in the video that the room, and an electrical panel in another part of the tunnel, are connected to electricity sourced through the hospital.

In the video, the admiral also shows a room that he called a “hideout,” with two cots and a wall-mounted air-conditioning unit that he says is connected to an engine outside a hospital building.

The Israeli military said that Hamas had likely emptied the rooms as Israeli forces advanced. Admiral Hagari says in the video that Hamas tried to seal and destroy portions of the tunnel ahead of the military’s arrival.

In another video released on Wednesday, Admiral Hagari enters a home that he says is near Al-Shifa’s complex and served as a classroom.

One group of leaders led by Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defense minister, sought to delay the cease-fire and release of 50 hostages in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel because of the fear it would slow the momentum of Israel’s invasion, allow Hamas to regroup and draw international attention away from the remaining 190 people held in captivity in Gaza.

Another group, which included David Barnea, the head of Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, who led the negotiations for Israel, argued that the deal was better than none and that the invasion could continue after the brief cease-fire, according to four senior security officials who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.

The first group initially took the upper hand, persuading Mr. Netanyahu to delay a cabinet vote originally planned for Nov. 14, according to three of the officials. They hoped that more military pressure might give Israel more influence at the negotiating table, allowing more hostages to be freed.

But the second group eventually won out, leading Mr. Netanyahu to hold the vote early Wednesday, setting the stage for a four-day truce and prisoner exchange that could begin this week. A senior defense official from the first group said that its members had changed their minds because the terms that Israel was able to obtain in the signed deal were significantly better than those that existed a week ago.

Mr. Netanyahu’s office, the Israeli military and the Mossad all declined to comment."
35,35,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-war-strategy.html,"The Israeli military’s seizure of Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest medical complex, is central to the military strategy at the heart of the ground invasion: Eradicate Hamas and free roughly 240 hostages taken during the Oct. 7 surprise attack.

That strategy has unfolded over the past three weeks as more than 40,000 Israeli soldiers encircled Gaza City, where Israeli officials say Hamas commanders were concentrated. The soldiers then attacked fighters and bunkers, all while targeting a vast tunnel network that Israeli officials say enables Hamas forces to hide and carry out operations. Israeli officials also assessed that striking so deeply in the heart of Gaza City would pressure Hamas to reach a deal on hostage releases.

Israel has long accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields in the densely populated Gaza Strip, and says the terrorist group positioned underground military facilities near homes, schools, mosques and hospitals throughout Gaza. Al-Shifa became Exhibit A in this narrative, as the Israeli military claimed Hamas used a vast maze of tunnels underneath the hospital as a base.

So far it is not clear that the Israeli strategy is working.

U.S. military officials said their Israeli counterparts tell them to expect more weeks of clearing operations in the north before Israel prepares a separate initiative in southern Gaza, widening the offensive.

The Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said late Friday that its troops would continue their offensive “in every place that Hamas is, and it is in the south of the strip.”

And although the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said in a video statement on Monday that Israel had “accelerated our activities against the tunnels” and that Hamas militants had lost control in the north and were fleeing south, military analysts said Mr. Gallant’s statements raised many questions."
36,36,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/23/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostage-deal-cease-fire-explained.html,"A deal between Israel and Hamas for a temporary cease-fire appeared to take effect on Friday. Here is a closer look at the agreement, mediated in part by Qatar, and how it is expected to play out.

What’s in the deal?

The agreement is for at least a four-day pause in hostilities. During that time, at least 50 women and children — from the roughly 240 people that Israeli officials say were abducted on Oct. 7 — were expected to be exchanged for 150 Palestinian women and minors imprisoned in Israeli jails.

The deal also includes an increase in humanitarian aid for Gaza, but Qatar’s foreign ministry did not release details. Hamas said Thursday that 200 trucks carrying relief supplies and four fuel trucks would enter the territory each day during the four-day pause. Israeli officials did not immediately comment.

Israel said its warplanes would not fly over southern Gaza for the duration of the cease-fire, and would not fly over the northern part of the territory for six hours each day.

How is it being carried out?

The pause had been scheduled to begin at 7 a.m. Gaza time (midnight Eastern) on Friday, Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman, Majed al-Ansari said Thursday, which Hamas confirmed. Mr. al-Ansari said a first group of 13 hostages would then be released starting at 4 p.m., in exchange for an undisclosed number of Palestinian prisoners.

In general, both Israel and Hamas have signaled that roughly 30 Palestinians will be exchanged for every 10 Israeli hostages.

Each day of the pause, Israel and Hamas will receive lists of the hostages and prisoners to be released, with Qatar passing them between the two parties, according to Mr. al-Ansari. He said that the International Committee of the Red Cross would be designated to receive the hostages, though he gave no further detail on the group’s role or where the hostages would cross the border.

The Israeli government has said that the hostages would be freed in four groups during the truce, each with at least 10 people.

An Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity on Wednesday said hostages turned over by Hamas would be taken to hospitals, and the seriously injured transported by helicopter. Those under 12 will be met at the border by their families, the official said, while older hostages will meet their families at hospitals, where they will also be debriefed by security services.

The official said the first Palestinians to be released from Israeli prisons will be allowed home only after the first tranche of Israeli hostages are freed.

Who are the Palestinian prisoners?

The Israeli government this week published a list of 300 names — all people 18 years old and younger or women — of Palestinian prisoners being considered for release. It was not immediately known who would be among the 150 to be released.

All the names on the list were described as “security prisoners,” or people who had been arrested in connection with offenses against national security. The prisoners are accused of offenses including supporting terrorism, acts of violence and throwing stones. There are also several charges of attempted murder. Most of the prisoners on the list had not been convicted of the charges.

There were 32 women and girls listed, including two 18-year-olds and a 15-year-old. Of the boys, 144 are 18 years old and 123 are between 14 and 17.

Who are the hostages being freed?

The Israeli prime minister’s office said it had received an initial list of names of the hostages who would be released and had contacted their families. It did not specify how many names were on that list.

At least 36 children and teenagers, ranging in age from infancy to the final year of high school, are being held in Gaza, and little is known about their whereabouts or well-being. Some, but perhaps not all, of them are expected to be among the hostages released in the coming days.

White House officials said on Tuesday that they expected the agreement to include the release of three Americans: two women and a toddler.

What happens after the cease-fire?

Israel has said that it will restart fighting after the truce ends and that it still intends to force Hamas from power in every part of Gaza. But some analysts say that it could prove difficult for Israel to regain momentum, particularly if Hamas dangles the possibility of further hostage deals — and if Israel’s partners push for a longer truce.

Emily Hand, an Irish Israeli, was kidnapped from a sleepover at a friend’s house in Kibbutz Be’eri and turned 9 while in captivity.

Her family initially believed she had been killed in the attack, but was later informed that she was kidnapped. Her older sister, Natalie Hand, told Israel’s Channel 12 that the family had cried for Emily when it was informed she had been killed.

“We were told that she had been murdered; we were in mourning,” she said. Then, “on Oct. 31, they told us that it was highly likely that she had been abducted.”

Speaking at a news conference at the Israeli Embassy in London recently, her father, Thomas Hand, said, “I’m going to pull every little string that I can for my own daughter, and hopefully that helps the rest as well.”

Ireland’s president met with Mr. Hand in recent weeks.

Maya Regev was at the Tribe of Nova music festival on Oct. 7 when Hamas attackers infiltrated Israel and massacred hundreds of young festivalgoers. Her brother, Itay, with whom she attended the festival, is still believed to be held in Gaza.

Their father, Ilan Regev Derby, described in October being haunted by the last conversation he had with Ms. Regev, which he recorded on his phone. She called as the gunmen closed in.

In one Hamas video, Itay is shown, hands bound, in the back of a pickup, alive. Another friend they attended the festival with, Omer Shem Tov, is also still believed to be held in Gaza.

Mirit Regev, Maya’s mother, expressed the mixed feelings of many families in a statement on Sunday:

“I’m excited and happy that Maya is on her way to us now. Nonetheless, my heart is split because my son, Itay, is still in Hamas’s captivity in Gaza,” she said, adding, “I am going to hug Maya so hard. We will not stop until Itay and all the hostages get back home.”"

You can tell the difference between the happy, joking, laughing boy he was, and who he is now. For a little bit there, it felt like every day he would come back and be released, and at least he would be here, even if all the others aren’t. And then we realized that wasn’t going to happen in the next few days. And that led to another just wave of agony. People I knew, I saw at every family gathering and at school, and they’re just gone. I mean, it’s not something that should ever happen to somebody, especially at that age. I can’t think of anything other than getting the hostages back."
39,39,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/world/middleeast/brics-summit-israel-gaza-war.html,"The BRICS group of developing countries — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — held a virtual summit on the war in Gaza on Tuesday, articulating divergent positions on the conflict that together reflected the reluctance of some nations outside the world’s largest industrialized democracies to fall in behind Washington’s support for Israel.

Several other nations that have been invited to join the BRICS group next year also attended the conference — Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates. A joint statement released by the group on Tuesday called for the release of all civilians who are being illegally held captive, as well as a humanitarian truce that would lead to a cessation of hostilities. The U.N. secretary general’s office signed on to the statement.

“We condemned any kind of individual or mass forcible transfer and deportation of Palestinians from their own land,” the statement said.

But the statement obscured subtle differences among the positions of the BRICS members. South Africa voiced stronger criticism of Israel than China, Brazil and Russia did, while India took a quieter approach.

In his speech to the conference, President Xi Jinping of China called for a cease-fire and an end to what he called collective punishment by Israel of people in Gaza. Mr. Xi, who was speaking by video, said the international community should take steps to stop the war from spreading. China last month vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution that stated that Israel had the right to defend itself.

President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who also called in his speech for a cease-fire, said BRICS states, along with countries in the region, could play an important role in finding a political solution to the conflict.

Moscow has expressed muted support for Israel after an attack on Oct. 7 in which Hamas killed around 1,200 people, most of them civilians; Mr. Putin did not call Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to express condolences until many days later.

President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, the summit host, also said Israel’s conduct in the war violated international law, repeating his strong criticism of the Israeli government, even as he said BRICS could help resolve the conflict.

“The collective punishment of Palestinian civilians through the unlawful use of force by Israel is a war crime,” he said. “The deliberate denial of medicine, fuel, food and water to the residents of Gaza is tantamount to genocide.”

Last week, South Africa referred Israel to the International Criminal Court. This week Israel recalled its ambassador to South Africa, while South Africa’s parliament voted to shut down the Israeli embassy.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India did not address the gathering, and it was unclear whether this reflected a shift in the country’s position on the war in Gaza.

Shortly after the Oct. 7 attacks, Mr. Modi posted on X, formerly Twitter, that India stood in “solidarity with Israel.” Late last month, India also abstained from a U.N. General Assembly resolution calling for a humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza, arguing that the text did not condemn Hamas.

The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, called the war a “humanitarian catastrophe” but avoided using the word genocide as he has in the past. He said Hamas’s terrorist attacks, while “barbaric,” did not justify the use of “indiscriminate and disproportionate force against civilians.”

“The innocent pay the price for the insanity of war, especially women, children and the elderly,” he said.

Avigail, who is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States, was kept with the four members of the Brodutch family with whom she was kidnapped on Oct. 7. The Brodutches were the Idan family’s neighbors at the Kfar Aza kibbutz, and Avigail had hidden with the family after her parents were shot.

According to the aunt, Tal Idan, the five hostages were kept in aboveground apartments, changing locations at least once. They were given a piece of pita with za’atar, a Middle Eastern spice mixture, each day to share.

While Avigail was in captivity, her hair was cut because she had developed a significant case of lice, Ms. Idan said in an interview this week. “She was covered in it. It took quite an effort to help her get rid of some of it the first night,” she said.

“It was lovely curly hair. And now it’s all gone. But it will grow again.”

When Avigail was released on Sunday, she was met at the border in Israel by her grandmother and an aunt. A military helicopter took them to a pediatric hospital near Tel Aviv. The military gave her a set of small, pink noise-canceling headphones to put over her ears.

Avigail’s family was relieved to learn that she was not alone during her captivity, and was looked after by Hagar Brodutch as she also cared for her own three children. “We are so grateful for Hagar,” Ms. Idan said, calling the 40-year-old “our guardian angel.”

Since the Oct. 7 attacks, Ms. Idan and her husband have helped care for Avigail’s siblings, Michael, 9, and Amelia, 6, who were not kidnapped. Now, she said, the children must adjust to a life without their parents.

“For all three of them, the focus is helping them get a new life — being able to feel safe again and being able to sleep for the entire night and not having nightmares,” she said."

Elon Musk traveled to Israel and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, touring the scene of a Hamas attack in a visit that appeared aimed at calming the outcry over his endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory on X, the social media platform he owns.

Dozens of major brands suspended their advertising on X after Mr. Musk this month agreed with a post that accused Jewish communities of pushing “hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.” The flight of advertisers threatened to cost X tens of millions of dollars, and the White House denounced Mr. Musk for “abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate.”

On Tuesday, after arriving in Israel, Mr. Musk wrote on X that “actions speak louder than words.” Wearing a flak jacket, he toured Kfar Aza, an Israeli kibbutz where dozens of people were killed during the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7.

Video shared by Mr. Netanyahu’s office showed the two men, accompanied by security personnel, walking through the village in the rain and inspecting the blackened ruins of a house. Mr. Netanyahu said on X that he gave Mr. Musk the tour “to show him up close the crimes against humanity committed by Hamas.”"
42,42,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/world/middleeast/abu-toha-palestinian-poet-gaza.html,"A celebrated Palestinian poet and essayist who founded the Gaza Strip’s first English-language library was released by Israel on Tuesday, two days after he was detained as his family was fleeing to southern Gaza on foot.

The poet, Mosab Abu Toha, was taken to a detention center in the Negev desert in southern Israel, said Diana Buttu, a family friend who spoke to him soon after he was released in Gaza at the same spot where he was first detained. She said he was likely freed because of public pressure, including from publications like The New Yorker magazine, which Mr. Abu Toha has contributed to, and the free speech organization PEN America.

“He was interrogated and he was actually beaten,” Ms. Buttu said. “They hit him in the stomach. They hit him in the face several times.”

The Israeli military confirmed that he was among several civilians taken in for questioning and he was then released. It did not immediately comment on the allegations that he had been beaten.

Dozens of other families who have arrived in central and southern Gaza have reported that their sons, husbands and fathers, who they said had no connection to armed Palestinian groups, have vanished after being stopped by Israel’s military along the evacuation route for those fleeing northern Gaza.

The Israeli military said it had apprehended 300 people during the ground invasion that began more than three weeks ago and said that they were connected to armed groups, adding that they “were brought into Israeli territory for further interrogations.” Those interrogations had led Israeli forces to the locations of underground tunnels, warehouses and weapons in Gaza, according to the military.

Mr. Abu Toha told Ms. Buttu that he was taken on Sunday along with more than 100 other Palestinians in Israeli military vehicles and driven into southern Israel, all while they were blindfolded. He did not see anyone else being released at the same time as he was, Ms. Buttu said.

“As he was leaving, the Israelis were bringing more people in,” she added.

After his release, he had to make his way down south along the evacuation road until he reached the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah, Ms. Buttu said. He roamed the streets until he saw someone he recognized and asked about his family, who arrived in the town on Sunday.

Mr. Abu Toha, 31, his wife, three children and his brother-in-law had left a school where they were sheltering in northern Gaza on Sunday and joined thousands of others walking south with what few possessions they could carry, according to his wife, Maram Abu Toha, and her brother, Ibrahim May.

The family was on a State Department evacuation list and they were making their way to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt in southern Gaza on Sunday when Mr. Abu Toha was taken, the relatives said. But when he was released on Tuesday, the Israelis had taken his and his family’s passports, Ms. Buttu said.

Israeli forces have taken over much of northern Gaza and ordered residents to move south as part of an air and land assault that followed the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that controls Gaza. Of Gaza’s 2.2 million residents, more than half have been displaced since the start of the war, according to the United Nations.

Human rights organizations say they are trying to ascertain how many Palestinians from Gaza have been detained and where they are being held.

“Reports of Israel detaining scores of those fleeing raises further serious concerns,” said Omar Shakir, Human Rights Watch’s Israel and Palestine director. “Civilians may only be detained when absolutely necessary for imperative reasons of security.”

Recounting the events of Sunday when her husband was detained, Ms. Abu Toha said that as the family walked past Israeli troops and tanks, soldiers called out to dozens of the men and ordered them to approach for questioning. Their families were forced to keep walking, she added, echoing similar accounts by other Palestinian families.

When they called on Mr. Abu Toha, he was carrying his 3-year-old son Mustafa, his wife said.

“I was in front of him by three meters and they told him, drop the kid and come toward the military,” Ms. Abu Toha said. “Mustafa was calling out to his dad.”

She ran back to get her son, she said, risking being shot by Israeli soldiers.

“Walk quickly or else I will shoot you,” she said a soldier yelled at her. “And then really, as we walked a bit, he started shooting on the road and the wall.”

The Israeli military did not respond to questions about reports that it was shooting at or toward evacuees.

Mr. Abu Toha’s family had no information about his whereabouts since he vanished on Sunday and was not even certain that he had been detained until they saw him on Tuesday.

In 2017, Mr. Abu Toha opened the English-language Edward Said Library in northern Gaza."

From New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.” [MUSIC PLAYING] I’ve gone back and forth on whether to do an episode on why the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has failed and failed and failed. My worry is that immersing in past failure can become just a way to justify present action or worse, justify present refusal to keep trying. Peace processes don’t work until they do. Israelis and Palestinians and, for that matter, Americans are trapped in arguments over their past. Sometimes, it’s the ability to forget, not the ability to remember that is necessary to forge a future. But I can see in the conversations I’m having and the emails I’m getting that what did or didn’t happen in this or that negotiation, it really lingers in people’s minds. So I wanted to at least try and do an episode tracing the shape of the successes — and there have been some — and failures until now. My guest today is Aaron David Miller. Miller was a negotiator and an adviser on the American side in the many Middle East peace processes the United States attempted to host to influence, to manage from 1985 to 2003. So he worked on this under Ronald Reagan, under George H.W. Bush, under Bill Clinton, under George W. Bush. He’s now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. And he’s the author of the book, “The Much Too Promised Land,” which is, I think, the best single volume history I’ve read of the various peace efforts. One thing this conversation helped clarify for me, we talk about deals in terms of compromises and concessions as if there are some perfect formula out there that if only we discovered it, it could end the conflict. But deals are, first and foremost, about deal makers who can deliver, who have the desire to deliver, who have the political support among their own constituents to deliver. One thing I can tell you having looked at this is there are no end of ideas out there for what an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement could look like. There are standard ideas. There are weird ideas. There are ambitious ideas. There are modest ideas. But what we don’t have, what we perhaps have never had on both sides at the same time are political leaders who want a deal and who can make and sell a deal, and who can enforce it once it is inked. I don’t think the work of the next generation is necessarily coming up with a new framework for a deal. It is building and supporting the political leaders and political movements that could actually do a deal. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING] Aaron David Miller, welcome to the show.

aaron david miller

Ezra, it’s a pleasure to be here.

ezra klein

You write that only three American leaders really belong in the Israeli-Arab peace hall of fame: Henry Kissinger, Jimmy Carter and James Baker. And so I want to go through them in turn. What did Henry Kissinger achieve? And why did he achieve it?

aaron david miller

All three of them and Kissinger, I think, understood this better than anyone else, that breakthroughs in this conflict or diplomacy in general are usually an interaction between opportunity and human agency. Kissinger understood that when, in fact, the region manifested itself in large amounts of pain, it created a sense of urgency, which, if married to gain, could — there’s nothing inevitable about this, nobody ever lost money betting against Arab-Israeli peace. Kissinger understood in the wake of the Oct. Yom Kippur War and the trauma that the Israelis suffered 2,800 dead, thousands of Egyptians and Syrians dead, that there was opportunity here. Kissinger had the deviousness, the sense of strategy that if he embarked on a journey and stuck with it, he might actually lay the basis and the groundwork for what became an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.

archived recording (richard nixon) We, in the United States, can be proud of the role that our government has played, and particularly, the role that has been played by Secretary Kissinger and his colleagues. This, I would say, is the first significant step toward a permanent peace in the Mideast.

aaron david miller

And it was a combination of a sense of opportunity married to what every good negotiator must have. And that is the capacity to act, slam shut the notebooks, threaten to walk out of the room with respect to both sides. And Kissinger would be the first of these three who wrestled with the Israelis. Actually decided in the spring of 1975, when he felt the Israeli government was balking over the terms of the second disengagement agreement with Egypt, he actually called for a reassessment of U.S. policy, summoning of our ambassadors in the region back to Washington. It was theater, but it seemed to help press the Israelis to accept the terms of disengagement agreement. So it was a combination of ample amounts of honey to gain Israel’s confidence, with ample amounts of vinegar, pressure at various times in order to push both the Israelis and the Egyptians closer to an agreement.

ezra klein

One thing that struck me about the story you tell about Kissinger was a sense of respect between the Americans and in this case also, one of the Arab leaders, which is Sadat of Egypt. Kissinger stops the Israelis from destroying a major part of the Egyptian military when they have it encircled. And there is, in this period, a, I don’t want to call it an equality, but there is a deeper sense of negotiating between equals in the region than there will be later when the negotiations take up with the Palestinians. I’m curious for your reflections on how that might have mattered here.

aaron david miller

I think it mattered greatly. The fact is when you’re dealing with established states, which have institutions, which have structure, the issues become much more tractable than in the case of a situation in which you have a nonstate actor — namely the Palestinian national movement — without much structure, without much discipline, pursuing violence and terror alongside of negotiations. It becomes much harder, and the existential issues were absent in the Israeli-Egyptian peace process, which I think turned it, in many respects, into a real estate deal, which it is certainly not when it comes to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Yes, real estate is a component, but it is much more than that.

ezra klein

I think it’s a good place to move to Jimmy Carter. So tell me a bit about his commitment to the issue, and what he achieves, and what his orientation is on it.

aaron david miller

When I interviewed Carter for this book, he said, I think it was at the age of three that he became interested in the biblical proposition and in Israel. I mean, Carter was a rare — the rare American leader, the only one, frankly, who was not pushed into peacemaking by the urgency or the exigencies of a situation. He chased after it. It was Carter’s single-mindedness, his focus, and the moral and ethical frame that he attached to resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict that enabled him to create the intensity of effort that was required both at the first Camp David in Sept. of 1978 and then, against the advice of his advisers, to embark on a spring trip early in 1979 to iron out the last remaining details of an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.

archived recording (jimmy carter) When we first arrived at Camp David, the first thing upon which we agreed was to ask the people of the world to pray that our negotiations would be successful. Those prayers have been answered far beyond any expectations.

aaron david miller

That sense of morality, of course, has followed Carter throughout his career and has made him an extremely controversial former American president willing to weigh in quite aggressively on foreign policy, generally, but on the Arab-Israeli conflict in particular. There are a lot of detractors of Jimmy Carter. And it brought home to me the sense that if you’re going to be a serious peacemaker — and Kissinger and Carter were serious peacemakers, each accomplished something quite different, Kissinger, three disengagement agreements, Carter, an actual Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. Nobody’s going to plant a tree in your honor. You are going to end up riling and fighting with Israelis, and by extension, the American Jewish community.

ezra klein

Well, he does get a Nobel Peace Prize.

aaron david miller

He does.

ezra klein

It’s something.

aaron david miller

Yeah, and he deserves it. But to this day — I interviewed Carter for my book on the presidents. To this day, I don’t think he fully understands why the American-Jewish community was so unforgiving of him, given his efforts.

ezra klein

Well, isn’t one answer to this — and this becomes, I think, important as we move through the story, but isn’t one answer that Carter, in terms of his relationships, in terms of his identification with the players in the conflict, is very close with Sadat. He does not find Menachem Begin, the Israeli leader, nearly as congenial. They do not have as deep of a relationship. From then on, I think it’s fair to say, you exclusively have presidents for whom the Israeli side is far more compelling than anyone on the Palestinian side, anyone on the Arab side. But for Jimmy Carter, he’s willing to play much more hardball because he does not naturally feel the sense of identification, not with — he does with the land of Israel, with Jerusalem, with the religious conflict here, but with the leadership of Israel itself, he talks about meeting Sadat as the best day of his presidency. He is very angry, oftentimes, at the Israeli leadership. I mean, there is something distinctive about Carter, which also makes the fact that he is the one who makes the biggest step towards Israel’s security a little bit ironic.

aaron david miller

Yeah, one qualification. Carter made it clear to me, and I think I write about it in the book, that he believed Begin came the farthest distance. And he understood that for Begin, this was a huge stretch. In many respects, a much more unnatural stretch than it was for Sadat. But you’re quite right, Ezra, about the changing nature of Israel’s Arab interlocutors, with one exception, and that was the heroic figure of King Hussein, who, like Sadat, understood the huge value of public diplomacy in an effort to reach out and capture the hearts and minds of Israelis.

ezra klein

Let me try to pull out two pieces of texture on this moment. One is that for almost the entirety of Camp David, Begin and Sadat are not talking to each other face to face. You have Jimmy Carter shuttling between different rooms they’re sitting in because he thinks if they’re brought together, it’ll blow up the negotiations. He’s got to move back and forth. I just think that’s a very striking detail that they’re not sitting at a table. And also, at the same time, there’s no centralized Palestinian voice there. There’s no Yasir Arafat sitting in the third room. So it’s just this very different era when the conflict is understood as between Arab countries, Egypt, and Syria, and Jordan, and Israel. And sure, there’s a Palestinian problem, there is this people caught in the middle, but they’ve not yet even been invited into negotiations over their own fate.

aaron david miller

Yeah, there’s no doubt about that. And I think Sadat concluded that the only way he could regain sovereignty over all of Egypt plus the dismantling of all Jewish settlements in Sinai would be to do a separate deal. And Carter wrestled with this because I think he understood the importance of engaging the organizational embodiment of Palestinian nationalism. That’s what the P.L.O. was in those days. Carter understood this but wasn’t prepared — and couldn’t — bring the P.L.O. into the negotiations. And frankly, had he tried, I suspect that Begin would not have been able to make the concessions and decisions that he was able to make on Sinai. Palestinians became a real issue in the negotiations during the first Bush administration.

ezra klein

So let’s talk then briefly about the first Bush administration and what they achieve under Bush 41 and James Baker, whose style in the book, listening to your travels with him, you really delight in James Baker. And I also think what he achieved here is a little fuzzier and harder to know from the outside. So what does James Baker get done? And why is he the one who can get it done?

aaron david miller

Baker and Bush, because the two go together, example of a situation in which the president of the United States empowered the secretary of the United States. I don’t think, even — no matter how close Tony Blinken is to President Biden, the relationship between Bush and Baker, even though Bush is older, was is an organic one. Bush helped Baker through the death of his first wife. And the two of them were as close as any American president and secretary of state could have been. I remember, I was in Baker’s office once, and he was on the phone with somebody. And the conversation went something like this: If you don’t give me what I need, I’m not going. I just can’t go. I mean, I need that authority. Now I don’t think that there have been any secretaries of state that can have that kind of conversation with a president. And I think that relationship was critically important to Baker’s success. But Baker was the best negotiator that I had ever worked for. Baker was not necessarily a strategist. He was a brilliant tactician. He was a great actor. And we saw him act on any number of occasions. I worked for a half a dozen secretaries of state. I traveled with a half a dozen. I like them all. And they all had their strengths. But when we landed, whether it was Damascus, Cairo, Jerusalem, wherever, you got off that plane, you got into a meeting, you saw Baker’s interlocutors sitting on the edge of their chairs, wondering what he was going to ask them for. Could they measure up? That toughness was, in essence, derivative of the fact that he knew that the White House had his back. And that was not always the case with secretaries of state and their presidents or the National Security Council. I remember once in Jerusalem with Powell, he had been undercut in the White House, pushed back on a statement that he had made. And he came out of the meeting, and he looked at me. And he took his fist, and he stuck it in my stomach. And Powell was great. He deployed these Yiddishisms every now and then. He grew up in the Bronx around Jews. And he said, Aaron, they got me in the kishkes. And I thought to myself, this would never have happened, working for Baker. There was a Vulcan mind meld between the president and the secretary. And that, more than anything else, I think, highlighted and reinforced Baker’s tremendous diplomatic skills. In the Arab-Israeli issue, it took a while to get Baker interested in this. He’d say, I’m not touring around. Don’t ask me to go out there. We got to have something to do. He did a lot of telephone diplomacy. So it took nine trips to get to Madrid.

archived recording (george h.w. bush) We come here to Madrid as realists. We don’t expect peace to be negotiated in a day or a week or a month or even a year. It will take time. And both the Secretary of State, Jim Baker and I, will play an active role in helping the process succeed.

aaron david miller

He got the Israelis to sit down with the Israeli-Jordanian delegation. He got Palestinian representation at Madrid. P.L.O., no. West bankers and Gazans, yes. You saw the beginnings of Israeli-Syrian negotiations during that period. And you saw the roots of what would be described as the multilateral negotiations, Israel and a number of regional parties discussing issues like security, water, the environment. And when you step back and look at Madrid, the real significance, in every decade of the last half century of the last century, there has been a major Arab-Israeli war, ‘48, ‘56, ‘67, ‘82. The ‘90s came and went without a major Arab-Israeli confrontation. And I’m persuaded that that decade was warless in large part because of the notion that Baker fabricated at Madrid. Baker eliminated the excuse that the Arabs and the Israelis had used for years as to why there couldn’t be an agreement because there was nobody at the other end of the table to talk to. Baker would create a figurative table, which I think lasted for most of the decade.

ezra klein

But what’s so interesting to me about that is that even at that table, I mean, we’re here in the ‘90s already, it’s the first time you have Palestinians at that table, that’s the ‘90s. It’s not the Palestinians we will end up thinking of as on the other side of the table. It’s not the P.L.O. — that even quite recently, what was happening at the table, the construction of a partner to negotiate with was very unformed. And even the presence of a kind of Palestinian authority, to use that in a colloquial term, not in terms of the official P.A., that’s new. I mean, the ‘90s are not that long ago. And even under Baker and Bush, you don’t have the group speaking that you eventually will. I mean, you have this great story in the book of talking with Yitzhak Rabin, and him walking through why there’s nobody to negotiate with on the Palestinian side, and clearly, beginning to work himself towards the question of if he’s going to negotiate with Yasir Arafat and the P.L.O. But the people who think it’s always been this Israeli-Palestinian negotiation, it’s really very recent.

aaron david miller

It’s a fascinating point because it speaks to the structural problems on the Palestinian side. Also, obviously, the psychological difficulties of bringing a more authentic representation of Palestinian nationalism into the negotiations. That story, Ezra, was a story that I told when Rabin had come for his first meeting with Bill Clinton in the spring of ‘93. And we met at The Washington Hilton. I’ll never forget it. And despite the nonsmoking sign, Rabin is sitting there, chain smoking and having an analytical discussion with us about how to deal with the Palestinian issue. And by his body language, it was absolutely clear to all of us that he had come to the conclusion that the only way to deal with this was not through Jordan or the West Bank or Gaza. He had to engage the organizational embodiment of Palestinian nationalism. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

Also is such an important accord, I mean, there’s been all this talk about the 30th anniversary of Oslo, and why did it fail. And it still is the framework that gets talked about and pulled. What do the Oslo Accords say or do that makes them such an important framework for so many decades?

aaron david miller

Most of what is known as the Oslo Accords lie bloodied, battered, and broken somewhere. But there are two important elements which have endured. One is the mutual recognition package that brought Israel for the first time into a direct acknowledgment, recognition and negotiation with the organizational embodiment of Palestinian nationalism, the P.L.O. That relationship, the capacity of both sides to look one another in the eye and to sit with one another as authentic, genuine expressions of the needs of both sides is critically important. Second is the reality that Oslo brought the Palestinian issue from the Palestinian diaspora into the center of Palestinian life in part of historic Palestine in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. And in doing so, it forced Palestinians to begin the tortuous process of creating self-governance and Palestinian institutions under extremely difficult circumstances, to say the least. But again, it’s real and it’s authentic. In that sense, Oslo succeeded, I think, in at least defining the nature of the problem.

ezra klein

One thing that struck me — there is, to me, the most indelible image of the entire U.S. Israeli-Palestinian peace process. [APPLAUSE]

archived recording (andrea miller) It was nothing short of breathtaking. Two veteran Warriors of Middle East battlefields joining a young American president in the first step toward peace. And at Arafat’s instigation, a handshake between two men who had been bitter enemies for decades.

ezra klein

Rabin and Arafat shaking hands on the White House lawn. Bill Clinton is next to them, beaming, thrilled. And what is so ironic about that image is that America had almost nothing to do with it. So can you tell me what is happening in that image?

aaron david miller

By the spring of ‘93, it was clear that there was an Oslo channel. We were being briefed up to a point, not about Israeli P.L.O. reconciliation, mutual recognition, which became part of the Oslo Accords, but we knew there was a channel. And we even had some sense that it could have been a decision making channel. And I remember, I was on vacation with my family in the west coast of Florida. I got a call from the State Department Op Center saying, you better come home quickly. Secretary is going to go out to California, where he’s going to meet the Israeli foreign minister and the Norwegian foreign minister. And rushed back to Washington. And what unfolded then was quite remarkable, a request by Peres that the United States host what would then become the signing ceremony. And Peres initially said, why don’t you — why don’t you assume credit and responsibility?

ezra klein

Just for listeners, who is Peres?

aaron david miller

Shimon Peres, who was then foreign minister under Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister. Why don’t you assume credit for this? And Christopher, to his credit, a decent human, said, absolutely not. But they asked the administration if they would host the signing ceremony. And that event on a cloudless, hot Washington day, Sept. 13, 1993, was etched in my mind, watching those three, a beaming Clinton, a very pleased Arafat, and a quite uncomfortable Rabin. The prime minister was some degree shy. I thought that I was in a galaxy far, far away. And I reached the conclusion, galactic misjudgment, that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process negotiations had reached a point of no return. And there was no going back. And caught up in that moment, I couldn’t understand fully that unlike Madrid, unlike the disengagement agreements, unlike the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, we were embarking on an enterprise so complicated, so fraught with political risk and existential risk for those who participated in it, that this would end up with twists and turns — cruel, hopeful twists and turns — along the way. On reflection now, I think I understand where the analytical problem was. And that’s this, that the issues on the table, borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees, what the Israelis wanted recognition of Israel as a nation state of the Jews, and the end of all conflict and claims, those six issues were unbelievably complicated and would prove to be impervious to Israeli-Palestinian agreement, and clearly impervious to American mediation. We were able to be effective brokers of an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. We were an effective broker of the process to Madrid when it came to the Israeli-Palestinian issue. There was at least one complicating factor. That was our greatest asset and our greatest liability, which was the extraordinarily close relationship that we had with the state of Israel. Because of our close identification with Israel, because of the domestic politics, we could not manage to play that role. We tried, and this is a disagreement that I’ve had with my colleagues. I wrote an Op-Ed in ‘05 in The Washington Post titled “Israel’s Lawyer.” I had resurrected that term out of Kissinger’s memoirs for Baker. He loved it. He kept saying, don’t make me Israel’s lawyer. I ain’t going to be Israel’s lawyer. I admitted in that op ed that I know a lawyer when I see one. And far too often during the Clinton administration, myself included, far too often, we acted as Israel’s lawyer, when, in fact, our client was not Israel or the Palestinians, it was an agreement. That’s what our client was, whether or not that was the determinative factor in not being able to reach an agreement, maybe it was the degree of difficulty of the issues themselves. And that is not a position that is uniformly agreed between me and many of my colleagues who participated in this process, but it is my view that because of the nature of our special relationship, it was extremely difficult for any American president or secretary of state to play the kind of role that would have been necessary in order to reach an agreement.

ezra klein

What comes next in a lot of people’s minds is Camp David. And I think the Israeli narrative and probably, the dominant American narrative is that at Camp David of an Israeli leader, Ehud Barak, who’s willing to offer a serious deal. Bill Clinton is there. He’s putting his power, his prestige, his time into negotiating this. And Arafat basically just walks away at the end. And more than he walks away, the Second Intifada begins, which really marks the end of the peace process in important ways. But before we get to that, what was offered at Camp David? How do the narratives of the various sides differ? And do you think any of those offers could have been accepted and sold to the respective constituencies?

aaron david miller

The Camp David summit was, in my judgment, even though I argued for it at the time, ill-advised, ill-conceived and ill-managed. And as a consequence, we ended up in a situation where a 14-day summit ran us, not the other way around. And let me make it clear: Ehud Barak went farther at Camp David than any Israeli Prime Minister had ever gone. There’s no question about it. Arafat came to Camp David to survive. He warned the president and Madeleine Albright that a summit that was not properly prepared would not succeed. Worried constantly, although assured by Bill Clinton that he would not be blamed, he came to Camp David, determined to defend Palestinian positions, what I call “the narrative,” with very little sense of, A, either making a counteroffer to the ideas on the table, or number two, to put forward a Palestinian proposal of his own. What Barak was prepared to accept at Camp David was this: Israel would be allowed to annex 9 percent of the West Bank. And in exchange, Palestine would have sovereignty over roughly 1 percent of pre-1967 Israel, but with no indication of where that 1 percent would be. On the very highly sensitive issue of refugees, the proposal only spoke of a satisfactory solution to the problem. Even on Jerusalem, where most of the detail was provided, there were a lot of gaps. So no Palestinian leader — I’ll repeat it — no Palestinian leader could have accepted that proposal and survived. Remember what Arafat’s models were. Sadat, 100 percent of Sinai and the dismantling of all Jewish settlements. And Barak is offering Arafat 91 percent and the 1 percent territory, which would have been taken out of Israel proper but not defined where it was or what it would be. Arafat could not have accepted this. The notion — and I’ve said this a million times to anybody who will listen — the notion that we were this close, thumb and first finger, a quarter of an inch, a 1/16 of an inch apart, the notion that close at Camp David and that Arafat walked away is simply wrong. We were this close. And I extended my arms out as far as I possibly could. That was not Arafat’s transgression. It was that he wouldn’t counter, nor would he offer a proposal, that diverged at all from the Palestinian narrative, which was 100 percent of the West Bank control over everything in East Jerusalem and some solution to the refugee problem that would have not just included the return of Palestinians to a Palestinian state, but to Israel proper. And I think that, in many respects, is a much more valid criticism of Arafat’s behavior at the summit than basically to say that he walked away from a formal proposal that could have led to a conflict-ending agreement.

ezra klein

We’ve discussed the way Arafat’s elevation in international negotiations to leader of the Palestinians sole voice for the Palestinian people is very recent at this point. I mean, the P.L.O. was — is an important organization. But until the handshake in ‘93 on the White House lawn, who you call when you are calling to make a deal with the Palestinians was much less settled. And when I read your book and when I read other histories of this, that strikes me as still a big part of the problem, which is to say that Arafat, it sounds like, and you can tell me if you think this is true or false, didn’t really have the authority to make the deal. He could not himself. He did not have the power or the control over Palestinian society, the institutions to make a counteroffer, sell it, and enforce it. But for all that he wants to be the negotiator, he is aware of his own politics. And he does not have the authority to make the kinds of offers Barak does, and which is to say, in a way, that the ground wasn’t ready for this. When Israelis say they did not have a partner for peace, that they are right. And Barak’s view that you could have a big deal settlement was, at this point, and maybe still we’ll talk about that, wrong.

aaron david miller

Look, if Arafat couldn’t do this deal or any deal with the moral authority that he had and with legitimacy that he had even presiding over a fractious Palestinian national movement, then I’m not entirely persuaded any Palestinian leader could do this deal. But again, remember, Ezra, we were at the beginning of a process. This was, to date, the only negotiation where you had an empowered American president willing to do whatever he could do six months before he left office. An Israeli — risk-ready Israeli Prime Minister who put things on the table that we had never heard before, and that surprised most of us. And a Palestinian leader who had authority, stature and who was viewed by most of the international community as the primary address for negotiations with Palestinians. The critique on Arafat, and after spending hundreds and hundreds of hours with him, I’m not sure we really fully understood who he was. People would say, what do you mean you didn’t understand who he was? You should have grasped this from the beginning that he presided over a pseudo revolutionary movement. He was the Monadel, the Struggler. And that he didn’t have the capacity to make the transition because he lived in a world, in a political world for decades that was so unlike any of his counterparts. And that we really never understood or maybe we didn’t want to understand because in essence, he was the address, and he had delivered during the early phases of the Oslo process, and even Rabin, who was no fan, to say the least, of Yasir Arafat, respected that Arafat had made some very tough decisions. The last time I saw him officially was in March of 2002. And the Israelis had surrounded his mukataa in his conference room, where he had met many times before, windows blacked out, doors barricaded. The only light in the room was candlelight. And there he was in this darkened candlelit room with his forbidding black machine pistol on the table, in full view, talking about martyrdom and how it was critically important that, if necessary, he would die in the defense of Palestine. That was my last official image of Yasir Arafat. And I left that meeting, wondering whether or not, based on who he was and his life story, did he have the capacity to deliver? And now, on reflection, looking back with the Palestinian national movement, looking like literally like Noah’s Ark, I mean, there are two of everything: two statelets, two constitutions, two sets of security services, two sets of patrons. Hamas is staying, at least for the moment, and Abbas presiding over 40 percent of the West Bank, 18th year of a four-year term, I wondered, if you can’t do the deal with Arafat and you can’t do the deal without him, what does that say about Palestinian leadership going forward?

ezra klein

To me, even having read accounts on both sides, it always does feel like the tell is the absence of Palestinian counteroffer. And I think this is very important to Israelis and the way they think of their role in the conflict. Yes, many of them agree the occupation is bad, it’s immoral, it’s deforming Israeli society, it’s terrible for the Palestinians. But they say, we have no partner for peace. We tried. And we’ve tried a number of times. There’s a later offer from Olmert. And there’s no partner because nobody ever comes back. As hard as the issues is, even with a maximalist position, nobody ever comes back from the Palestinian side and says, here is my unreasonable thing that you certainly won’t agree to, but at least here, I’m putting it out in writing. And maybe it’s because of Yasir Arafat’s background and life history, or maybe it’s because they don’t have the domestic political capital at home to survive that because they’ll — Hamas will then take advantage of the failure. Whatever it is, I think that the story you tell here — as balanced as the way you try to tell it is — it does affirm to me the Israeli story, which is that there has never been a partner, there’s never been a counteroffer, there’s never been somebody on the Palestinian side willing to say, this is what we would accept, even if it’s not what you would accept, and then work from there to where you’d have to go. I mean, what am I getting wrong here?

aaron david miller

Well, we could elaborate a little. But there’s no question that if you took a look at your trajectory of offers from Camp David, to the Clinton parameters, to the Taba negotiations, to the Ehud Olmert / Abbas negotiations, in which Olmert offers 6.5 percent to be annexed and then offers the Palestinians 5.9 percent of territory to offset that, and then you move on to the Kerry proposals of 2013, 2014, there’s no doubt that that trajectory validates — invited a man or woman from Mars down to observe this situation, and the conclusion would be, whatever the asymmetry of power, however just the Palestinian claim that we have to settle for only 22 percent when in fact, we wanted all of historic Palestine. So any departure from that 22 percent we won’t accept. But the reality is there was no counteroffer, either at Camp David, the Clinton parameters. Abbas never responded to Olmert. And he left the carry proposals 2013, 2014 on the table. There’s no question that even the most ardent critic of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank would have to acknowledge that, in effect, when you make the perfect the enemy of the good, you get neither the perfect nor the good. So I guess I would argue that, on balance, had there been a counteroffer or had the Palestinians put a proposal on the table and pressed the Israelis, maybe the outcome would have been different.

ezra klein

Let me ask you something, because I’m just some guy with a podcast, reading history books. But you have had, for decades, deep contact and relationships with Yasir Arafat, with many on the Palestinian negotiating teams, surely, you’ve said to them, where’s your counteroffer? If only for your own P.R., why are you not coming back here with something? And they don’t want to be seen, and they reject being seen as the ones who collapsed these negotiations. They don’t want to be seen by the International community to be unwilling to negotiate. What do they say to you?

aaron david miller

The Palestinian negotiators that we dealt with actually were quite intrigued and interested in alternative proposals. There was a lot of internecine conflict between the negotiators, and Arafat played on that, playing one against the other. But I think those Palestinians who understood the chairman actually were prepared to be much more flexible. And had it been left to the Israeli and Palestinian negotiating team during those years, the odds of reaching an agreement, I think, would have been much higher. But they were captives of a system, and there was no way, given the way that system was structured, that you could have seen any serious challenge. No one could have gone to Arafat and said, look, boss, you can’t continue to behave this way, not a chance. And I think that was a huge factor in trying to understand and intuit why Arafat was simply not — he could not be moved from the 22 percent solution, which was a near-perfect narrative which would have required the Israelis to make significant compromises on core issues while leaving the Palestinian position more or less intact. There are those who believe that there was Palestinian flexibility at Camp David. They were prepared to agree to swaps, for example. The Israelis wanted 4 percent or 5 percent to be annexed in order to deal with the demographic and security realities, including incorporating settlements and settlement blocks in Israel proper. Palestinians were prepared to accept swaps. But I don’t see how you could have come closer than what Ehud Olmert offered them, which was virtually adding everything up to 100 percent. It was part of Arafat. It was part the structure of the negotiations. It was part the mistrust and absence of confidence. It was part the failure of the interim process, which turned everything into a negotiation. Palestinians were put on probation. But in the end, what is leadership?

ezra klein

You often hear this question: Is the problem here in 1967 — or is it 1948? Is the problem for the negotiations for Palestinians, at least within the negotiation, are they willing to take a deal that is about the territory Israel gained West Bank and Gaza in ‘67? Or is the problem the founding of the state of Israel and, as such, that there is no resolution?

aaron david miller

Well, clearly, in the case of Hamas, which is the organizational embodiment of an idea, which is the elimination of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state, that is clearly the case. Do I believe that it is conceivable, possible, that a Palestinian leader could emerge that would agree to a deal based on the Clinton parameters and any other adjustments that would meet both Israeli and Palestinian needs and requirements? Do I believe that this process could only occur through a negotiation and that, in essence, what the last month has demonstrated with a terrifying ferocity, it has shattered, in my judgment, any illusion that anyone has ever had that Israelis and Palestinians could somehow coexist peacefully in either a one state reality, which is what we have now, or some sort of binational state, where Israelis and Palestinians live happily ever after under one roof? No. The only solution to this conflict is separation through negotiation. There must be a way to address the proximity problem, which is what separates this negotiation from Israel’s relationships with Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, the Abraham Accords for sure. Separation through negotiation. I think it was Twain who said that proximity breeds contempt and children. But for sure, it’s going to continue to breed terror and violence. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

Let me take the Israeli perspective on this for a moment. And there’s a lot in the last 10 or 15 years of Israeli politics I am profoundly critical of and disgusted by. But I think if you’re an Israeli hearing this, there is nobody to have that negotiation with. You’re not going to have it with Hamas. As you say, they’re an embodiment of the idea that Israel must be destroyed. Abbas has functionally no support. He’s unbelievably unpopular from everything we can tell, even if you could make a deal with Abbas. There’s no reason to think Hamas would abide by it. There are other players like Islamic Jihad and other even more extreme players circling. So when you talk about negotiations, I mean, if you couldn’t have a negotiation in the end with Arafat for whatever reason, the situation seems dramatically worse now. And so the idea that there is any pathway here that is negotiation seems almost like a category error, that nobody has the control over the situation on the Palestinian side, the support nobody speaks with enough authority that there is a deal to be made. And so I think — you talk often in the book about the way Israelis often see Americans as naive about Palestinians, about Arabs, that we’re over here, and we like to put things in our frameworks of negotiations, and diplomacy, and liberal democracy, and got a great scene where Rabin just waves his hand and says, you don’t understand the Arabs. You talk about a flight with Netanyahu where he says, you can afford to give the Arabs the benefit of the doubt from the safety and security of Washington. Out here in our neighborhood, we can’t and won’t. And for them, even if you had more moderate, more open-minded leadership than Netanyahu, that there’s no buddy on the other side of the table that’s fake. It’s a Washington construction.

aaron david miller

I don’t think anybody in their right mind could argue with that assessment. I mean, we began this conversation with trying to answer the question as to why we haven’t had an Israeli-Palestinian conflict ending agreement. In my judgment, the sun, the moon, and the stars were never aligned. And they are certainly not aligned now because what you need, you do not have. But I don’t and will not surrender to the forces of hopelessness and despair to basically argue that it simply cannot be. You need at least four things. Number one, you need leaders on both sides who are masters of their politics, not prisoners of their ideologies. You do not have that. Number two, you need a sense of real ownership, the profound piece of philosophy that in the history of the world, nobody ever washes a rental car is critically important because people care about what they own, and there’s no ownership. Every breakthrough, every one, without exception, was preceded by or conducted without the presence of the United States. And you do not have that sense that Israelis and the Palestinians have to do this because it makes sense for them. Number three, you need effective mediation, if not from the U.S., then by another party that is prepared to apply ample amounts of honey and assurance, and a lot of vinegar and pressure when it’s necessary. And finally, you’re going to need an organizing framework in which both sides can see the outlines of where this is headed, an end state. We don’t have any of those things.

ezra klein

One thing I think a Palestinian might say here is it might be the case that Israel has not had a partner able to deliver on a peace deal. But it’s also the case that Israel has not been strengthening the position of the kinds of partners who might be able to deliver on a peace deal. They didn’t spend the last 10 or 15 years making Abbas look better, making his relative moderation deliver for Palestinians. Instead, they’ve actively undermined him. They made him a security subcontractor, but at the same time, they let settlers run wild, building settlements and functionally annexing parts of the West Bank, there’s been a lot of violence there, that whatever was true 15 years ago doesn’t, at this point, Israel also bear some responsibility for acting in a way that you could argue strengthened Hamas. I mean, Netanyahu has talked about trying to keep the two sides divided. And certainly, not acting in a way that made it look to Palestinians like their more moderate leadership could actually deliver for them.

aaron david miller

Well, I think that’s 100 percent correct. I think the Israeli strategy, certainly the strategy of Mr. Netanyahu, was what I call the three-state solution. He was perfectly comfortable with Abbas in control of 40 percent of the West Bank while the Israelis control percent in area C in which the Palestinians have no political civilian or security control. And Hamas stand in Gaza and the state of Israel. As long as the Palestinians cannot claim a monopoly on the forces of violence within their society, and they cannot, which is the ultimate element of credibility and legitimacy of a state, then there was no way, without one gun, one authority, one negotiating position that the Palestinian National Movement could ever present itself as a credible, legitimate interlocutor. And as a consequence, that was just fine with an Israeli government that was far more interested in what I call the 22 state solution to the Israeli Arab-Israeli conflict, 22 members of the Arab League, than it was in the two state solution. So yes. And everything that the government has done with respect to delegitimizing the Palestinian Authority, creating a situation through expanded settlement activity, land confiscation, certainly, in the last 10 months, where the government guidelines basically articulated an unbreakable link between Israel and the term they used, Judea and Samaria. So there’s no question about it.

ezra klein

Let’s say we are somewhere in the future, not super far in the future. But Netanyahu has fallen because he is widely loathed in Israel right now. Benny Gantz is now prime minister. Let’s say, Joe Biden is still president. And Gantz and Biden are sitting down. And they’re thinking about number one on your list there, that you actually need leaders on both sides who are masters of their craft. And I’m not saying Biden and Gantz are necessarily those leaders on the American or Israeli sides, but that one precursor to anything ever being possible is a stronger Palestinian leadership, a leadership that has proven through success or something else that it is worthwhile for the Palestinian people, and so has developed support in a way that the current Palestinian Authority or Hamas has not. What do you do? Is that in their power at all? I mean, in some ways, it’s a ridiculous question, the Palestinians don’t want Israel’s help in creating a leadership. But if you’re going to try to create conditions for something like that to emerge, if that was your goal for the next 10 years, just in 10 years to have somebody to negotiate with, what do you do? What would you advise them to do?

aaron david miller

Are leaders born or do they emerge in response to crisis and/or opportunity? Where did Volodymyr Zelensky come from? How do you produce a de Klerk and a Mandela? Nobody believed apartheid would end the way it did. Nobody. And yet, it ended largely because of Mandela and de Klerk. That kind of leadership existed certainly in the Arab-Israeli context, with a Begin and a Sadat, and even Arafat in his initial incarnation. But they’re all gone now. And legitimizing Palestinian leadership certainly requires elections. But even then, can you have elections that make any sense and produce leaders when you have this perverse dance between the occupier and the occupied?

ezra klein

I mean, elections are how you got Hamas.

aaron david miller

Yes, that’s right. And you haven’t had legislative elections or presidential elections, certainly, not presidential elections since 2005. But you’re going to need new leadership. And where does that come from? Marwan Barghouti, who is serving five lifetime sentences in an Israeli jail. Oct. 6, the Arab Barometer, in conjunction with Khalil Shikaki’s polling organization, took a poll, this was a day before Oct. 7, and asked 790 respondents who they would vote for president. 12 percent said Abbas. 24 percent said Ismail Haniyeh, leader — political leader of Hamas. 33 percent, 34 percent said Marwan Barghouti. I can’t answer that question, Ezra. And in not answering it, we’re not being able to answer it and not being able to see the emergence of a Palestinian leader who has both the street cred, the legitimacy and the authority, I don’t see it happening.

ezra klein

Should Israel release Barghouti?

aaron david miller

It’s been considered numerous times by the Israelis. And I don’t know, in view of what’s happened over the last four months, whether any act that Palestinians or Israelis can take in the short term that that would create a different environment. I mean, you’re going to be dealing with two traumatized communities. And there will be a political reckoning on each side. Israel has an institutional set of arrangements that will allow that political reckoning to have some sense of structure. People will resign. There may be another election or a new government constituted in place. But the course correction is not going to be toward a center-left government. More likely, it’s going to be toward a center-right government. And on the Palestinian side, what does the future hold for them? If Hamas survives, even if residual elements survive to create an insurgency in Gaza, over time, Palestinian National Movement will remain, as I mentioned it before, like Noah’s Ark. Abbas is 88. At some point, he will pass from the scene. Maybe there will be a collegial leadership that’ll emerge, several individuals. It is my contention, and this is why I tend to — at least on this piece, I tend toward hopelessness and despair on this issue is because of the absence of leadership. I don’t see how Israelis and Palestinians even manage this process without leaders of such stature who are admired with authority to make the kinds of decisions required. If I was depressed before this conversation began, I’m thoroughly depressed now because the clarity of what’s coming seems to me to be so inescapable.

ezra klein

I want to go back to something about the leadership, which is, my colleague, Tom Friedman, who is forgotten more about Israel and Palestine than I will ever know, recently put out a column where he said, it’s time for a Biden plan — that at least, put something down on paper, make it public, and force different players on different sides to show where they are, Abbas, Netanyahu, Gantz, whoever you want to think about as a possible decision maker here. Do you think that would be productive?

aaron david miller

I love Tom, and we talk and argue about this stuff all the time. Look, a Biden plan might improve American credibility. It would certainly put the U.S. on record as proposing at least where we stood. But a plan without a pathway to actualize it becomes just another rhetorical — it’s a substitute for a peace conference, which we actually don’t need, and failure costs. So do I think, for American interests, it would be important to put something out, both as a recognition that the United States still believes in a diplomatic process and an end state that could, if Israelis and Palestinians were prepared to rise to the challenge, moderate or perhaps, one day, end the conflict? Yeah, I think that’s fine. But it comes along with a huge responsibility. And that is to actually do things to bring Israelis and Palestinians closer to a point where in fact, they could accept such a plan.

ezra klein

Well, let me end on that question because we have just knocked down or mired in complexity lots of things different people could maybe do. Who could do what in your view? What would be moves, be they by Abbas, by other players in the Palestinian set of regimes, by Israelis, by Gantz, by Netanyahu, by Biden, by Blinken, by Saudi Arabia, by the Europeans, who can do what? What is an actual lever, somebody with power, in this could pull that would be productive?

aaron david miller

You’re talking about something that could actually be done in the moment? Now?

ezra klein

Yes. Not for — not — or in the coming months. I’m not talking about a plan. I’m not somebody — I keep saying this on the show, I do not believe in solutions here right now. I think we are in a way pre-solutionary space. I think talk of two state deals is ridiculous. But there is better and there is worse. There are actions. There’s increments. You can always do something. What should somebody do?

aaron david miller

Well, for openers, I would argue that the current Israeli government, for their own interests, ought to do everything they possibly can to ensure that you don’t have settlers engaging in vigilantism and forcing Palestinians off of their land, harassing, and even killing them. And the Biden administration has pressed the Israelis, but it still continues. I mean, I think the numbers are at least over 1,000, maybe more Palestinians, have literally been forced off of their land. And while we have this conversation, elements of the Israeli government, particularly, Bezalel Smotrich, are busy at work, trying to continue to pursue, literally under the cover of this distraction in Gaza, a policy toward the West Bank which is annexationist in everything but name. That process continues. But I can’t give you an Rx or a prescription. Mahmoud Abbas is capable of doing almost nothing right now, in large part, because he’s perceived to have done nothing in order to alleviate Palestinian suffering in Gaza and can’t even protect his own constituents in the West Bank. So I mean, I wish I could answer that question. I can’t.

ezra klein

I appreciate that honesty. We’re not a show that tries to peddle on false hope. I think that’s a place to end. So always our final question, what are three books you would recommend to the audience?

45,45,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/us/politics/biden-thanksgiving.html,"Workers swept wet leaves off the cobblestone streets around blustery downtown Nantucket on Wednesday morning as the island prepared for a shopping run by its most famous annual visitor: President Biden.

Mr. Biden and Jill Biden, the first lady, arrived on the exclusive island off the coast of Massachusetts late Tuesday for their traditional Thanksgiving week visit. The couple was whisked directly from Nantucket Memorial Airport to a $34 million home of a billionaire friend, David Rubenstein, where the family will stay through Sunday.

The home of Mr. Rubenstein, a co-founder of the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, is on 13 acres of beachfront property with sweeping views of Nantucket Harbor.

The island has been bustling with activity awaiting the first family’s arrival. Earlier this week, a C-17 aircraft landed to deliver vehicles and security equipment. Secret Service agents and White House staff members have filled the hotels and were meandering through local boutiques.

Still, the president’s visit has a more subdued feel this year than in years past as rain fell and the wind whipped through Nantucket on Wednesday, delaying a potential pre-Thanksgiving visit downtown. Many locals also pointed out that Mr. Biden has been coming to the island for some 40 years, and that this is his third visit as president.

They’re used to it by now.

“It’s like: ‘The Bidens are here. OK, cool,’” said Suzanne Bennett, who manages Nantucket Bookworks, a local bookshop where Mr. Biden has popped in on previous walks in town. Ms. Bennett said she hadn’t done much of anything to prepare for this year’s likely Biden family visit, and described the morning routine as business as usual."
46,46,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/us/politics/israel-pause-humanitarian-aid-gaza.html,"President Biden and his aides are using an agreement for a brief halt to hostilities in Gaza to push the Israeli government to take broad measures aimed at lessening the harm to Palestinian civilians, including setting up safe areas, allowing in more medical aid and permitting larger deliveries of fuel, U.S. officials say.

American and Qatari officials are also pushing their Israeli counterparts to consider extending the planned four-day pause in fighting if Hamas pledges to free more hostages beyond the 50 now promised. The agreement, whose details were still under negotiation, has terms for extending the pause.

Israel continues to dismiss calls for a longer-term cease-fire accompanied by political negotiations, despite growing U.S. and international concern about the civilian deaths and humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

The American officials, who say they support Israel’s right to defend itself, expect Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet to continue the military campaign in Gaza that began after the Hamas terrorist attacks nearly seven weeks ago, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 240 others abducted.

Mr. Biden called Mr. Netanyahu on Wednesday to discuss the hostage release agreement, and also spoke with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the president of Egypt, according to White House statements summarizing the calls. U.S. officials had been traveling among those three nations to help forge the hostage agreement.

Mr. Biden discussed with Mr. Netanyahu the pause, “which will allow for surging in much-needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza,” according to the White House summary. Mr. Biden also spoke about the need for “maintaining calm” along the Israel-Lebanon border, where Israel and Hezbollah have been striking at each other, and in the West Bank, where at least 190 Palestinians have been killed in violence since Oct. 7, either in encounters with the Israeli military or extremist Israeli settlers.

In their call, Mr. Biden and the Qatari emir “reiterated the importance of protecting civilian lives, respecting international humanitarian law and increasing and sustaining humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza,” according to the White House.

The two also talked about setting the conditions for “the establishment of a Palestinian state” — a goal that Mr. Biden says is the best solution to the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

American officials say the death toll in Gaza — more than 12,000, about 40 percent of them children, according to the health ministry there — is too high, and has turned many nations against Israel’s tactics and undercut public support for the country in the United States. And the U.S. officials are worried about the Israeli military’s expected offensive in southern Gaza, where many of the enclave’s two million people have sought shelter.

As it pummeled Gaza City in the north, the Israeli government told residents to go to southern Gaza, and many did so. But Israel has continued to carry out airstrikes across the south with large munitions: 1,000- to 2,000-pound bombs.

U.S. officials say they have told their Israeli counterparts that an offensive in the south with high civilian casualties would further isolate Israel in the court of global opinion, including among its Arab neighbors, who have sharply denounced the ongoing violence and called for a long-term cease-fire.

“We have made clear to them, as we have made clear publicly, that we think they should not commence with further activities in the south until they have taken the proper steps to account for the humanitarian needs there,” Matthew Miller, the State Department spokesman, said at a news briefing on Tuesday.

Mr. Miller estimated that several hundred thousand people had moved from northern Gaza to the south, adding: “Before any military offensive begins there, we would want to ensure that those people are properly protected.”

The Biden administration has so far refrained from imposing conditions on military aid to Israel, which is by far the greatest leverage that the U.S. has in that relationship. Israel has asked for more bombs and at least 24,000 assault rifles, which has raised concerns among some American officials since the far-right minister overseeing Israel’s national police, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has been arming civilian militias.

Mr. Biden is also asking Congress to approve a $105 billion package of mainly military aid for Ukraine and Israel — with the latter amounting to $14.3 billion.

American and U.N. officials have begun a push to persuade the Israeli government to allow for the creation of safe areas in the south, which in theory would be entire neighborhoods that have been relatively undamaged by strikes so far and would be safe from attacks, U.S. officials say.

David Satterfield, the U.S. special envoy for humanitarian aid, is in the region and is negotiating with Israeli officials over the safe areas, a U.S. official said, with the hope that the planned four-day halt to the fighting gives the Americans enough of a window to get an agreement.

In anticipation of the deal to release hostages and prisoners, the U.S. Agency for International Development positioned humanitarian aid in Egypt for swift delivery into Gaza for once the fighting pauses. U.S. officials say their top goals include providing fuel that would help generate electricity for Gaza’s hospitals, water desalinization, bakeries and sewage pumping, necessary to prevent cholera outbreaks.

At the request of U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, Israel agreed late last week to allow 140,000 liters of fuel into Gaza every two days. Under the hostage release agreement, that amount is supposed to increase to 120,000 liters per day for the duration of the pause. But U.S. officials say that is meager given the enormous need, and they are pressing Israel to allow in a much greater amount.

Under the agreement, Israel is also supposed to allow into Gaza 200 trucks loaded with aid per day during the pause, which would include medical supplies and food, twice as much as what they had been permitting. As with fuel, U.S. officials say they are pushing the Israelis to allow in more. The Israeli cabinet can vote to approve any number.

In an interview with National Public Radio on Wednesday, Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, said the agreement should allow for more transit through multiple border crossings into Gaza that he asserted had been under regular shelling from Hamas.

Mr. McGurk, who had just returned from the Middle East after playing a central role in the hostage negotiations, suggested that the four-day pause might be extended, saying that “you can do more with more time.”

“And the onus for more time right now is on Hamas,” he added. “So if Hamas produces additional hostages — and they have given indications to Qatar and to the Egyptians that they will, they’re prepared to do that — the pause here will continue.”

Martin S. Indyk, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, said he believes that President Biden remains opposed to a cease-fire, as he has said many times, on the grounds that it would amount to a victory for Hamas.

But, he added, “the dynamic that they’ve put in play here is interesting; it’s not that they expect the pause will turn into a cease-fire” lasting weeks or longer.

“It’s that the structure of the pause is such that if Hamas wants to continue to avoid more Israeli military action, they’re going to have to pay for it in terms of releasing more hostages — but getting more Palestinian prisoners in return,” he said.

In his call with Mr. Sisi on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said he “affirmed that under no circumstances can Gaza remain a sanctuary for Hamas where they can threaten Israel and Palestinians alike and imperil any pathway to a durable peace,” according to the White House summary.

But Mr. Biden also reiterated that “under no circumstances will the United States permit the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank, or the besiegement of Gaza, or the redrawing of the borders of Gaza,” the White House summary said.

Some Israeli officials have asked the United States to request that Egypt and other Arab nations take in refugees from Gaza, but Mr. Sisi and other Arab leaders have firmly said no — a message that Mr. Blinken has conveyed to Israel.

Officials in the region expect intensive diplomacy to continue, with potential visits in the near future by Mr. Blinken and other senior U.S. officials. In a statement late Tuesday, Mr. Blinken thanked Egypt and Qatar for the roles they played in the hostage deal.

The deal was the fruit of seeds planted in a meeting Mr. Blinken had with Qatari leaders in Doha on Oct. 13, when those leaders told Mr. Blinken that Hamas, which has a political office in Qatar, was willing to free some hostages for a pause in hostilities, a U.S. official said.

“While this deal marks significant progress, we will not rest as long as Hamas continues to hold hostages in Gaza,” Mr. Blinken said Tuesday in a statement. “My highest priority is the safety and security of Americans overseas, and we will continue our efforts to secure the release of every hostage and their swift reunification with their families.”"
47,47,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-al-shifa-hospital-hamas.html,"Israel’s claims that Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that controls Gaza, operated from within the sprawling Al-Shifa complex have been central to its defense of its military campaign in Gaza. Israel says the soaring number of civilian deaths — more than 11,000 people, according to the Gazan authorities — has been caused in part by Hamas’s decision to hide its military fortifications and command centers inside civilian infrastructure like Al-Shifa.

The United States has backed Israel’s assertions that Al-Shifa Hospital was used by Hamas’s armed wing, with John Kirby, the U.S. National Security Council spokesman, telling reporters on Thursday that U.S. intelligence agencies had reached that conclusion independently.

“We have our own intelligence that convinces us that Hamas was using Al-Shifa as a command and control node — and, most likely, as well, as a storage facility,” CNN quoted Mr. Kirby as saying.

On Thursday the Israeli military said troops were using scanners at the hospital to search for “underground infrastructure” while under fire. The need for the scans highlighted the difficult reality of the military campaign.

Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said on Tuesday that Israeli forces now controlled “the aboveground area” of northern Gaza. On Thursday, he said in a video statement that Israeli troops had “completed the capture and clearing of the entirety of the eastern part of Gaza City.” Yet, thousands of Hamas members could still be ensconced in tunnels under the Israeli positions.

The Israeli military’s release of a video on Thursday of what it said was a tunnel used by Hamas inside the Al-Shifa complex shows an area of excavated ground and an underground passage and door around two to three meters deep. The New York Times confirmed that the passageway was at the northern perimeter of the sprawling complex.

But it was unclear from the video what purpose the passageway served or how far it extended. Israeli forces appear to have destroyed a small structure and dug an extensive area of ground to uncover it, an analysis of satellite imagery and video showed. The structure appeared to be around the size of a domestic car garage with a canopy extending from it."
48,48,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostages-families.html,"As Israel and Hamas indicated that they were preparing a cease-fire to free 50 hostages, some families of those abducted to Gaza last month were grappling with conflicting emotions: a growing optimism that their loved ones would return that was chilled by a gnawing fear that the deal might collapse — or worse, that they might be left behind.

“If we’ve been on a roller coaster, now we’re going up,” said Gili Roman, whose sister Yarden Roman was taken hostage from Be’eri, a Gaza border kibbutz, during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7. “The fear is that the higher we go, the farther we’ll fall. There’s a lot of anxiety.”

The Israeli government and Hamas announced Wednesday morning that they would uphold a brief cease-fire in Gaza to allow for the release of some of the roughly 240 hostages held by Hamas and other militant groups.

The Israeli decision, announced by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office in a WhatsApp message, would allow for a pause of at least four days in the fighting in Gaza. If it holds, it would be the longest halt in hostilities since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks prompted Israel to begin its bombardment and subsequent ground invasion of Gaza.

Less than an hour later, Hamas announced in a statement on Telegram that it had agreed to a four-day cease-fire that would allow for 50 hostages to be exchanged for 150 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

Yifat Zailer — whose cousin Shiri Bibas was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz along with Ms. Bibas’s husband, Yarden Bibas, and their two red-haired children, Ariel and Kfir — said her anxious wait for news has been tinged by the hope that she might soon see her loved ones and the fear something might go awry."
49,49,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/us/politics/obama-biden-letter-israel.html,"More than 100 former members of the Obama and Biden administrations have sent a letter to the White House praising President Biden’s “moral clarity, courageous leadership and staunch support of Israel,” in an effort to defend Mr. Biden’s policies amid roiling dissent within the administration.

The letter backs the president’s request for $14.3 billion in new security assistance for Israel and affirms his opposition to a cease-fire, challenging anonymous demands from hundreds of officials across the Biden administration that Israel halt its military offensive in the Gaza Strip.

It was signed by several prominent Democratic figures, including Ron Klain, Mr. Biden’s former chief of staff; Lawrence H. Summers, who directed the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama; Colin H. Kahl, who recently departed as under secretary of defense for policy; and Michèle A. Flournoy, who held that job in the Obama administration.

The list of officials also includes 19 former ambassadors, such as Joseph W. Westphal, who was the U.S. envoy to Saudi Arabia under Mr. Obama.

The total number of signatories, 137, is smaller than the more than 500 behind a letter sent to Mr. Biden on Monday demanding he support an immediate cease-fire to limit civilian casualties in Gaza. Israel’s government and Mr. Biden have rejected such a step as incompatible with Israel’s goal of destroying Hamas. The newer letter was delivered to Mr. Biden on Tuesday with 115 names, but its organizers continued to collect signatures until Friday.

Organizers of the letter supporting Mr. Biden argued their missive should carry more weight because it publicly discloses the names of all those who signed and the group includes many former senior officials with experience in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The earlier letter of dissent was delivered to Mr. Biden with a signature count but without names, although the signatories are known to that letter’s organizers. The same arrangement was used for a similar open letter to Samantha Power, the U.S. Agency for International Development administrator, which has attracted more than 1,000 anonymous signatures.

Halie Soifer, a former adviser to the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in the Obama administration who helped organize the letter of support for Mr. Biden, said she believed that dissent within the administration had “been blown out of proportion” and that anonymous letters “call into question the message,” in part because it is impossible for White House officials and the public to judge the seniority and expertise of those who sign them.

But some critics of Israel’s military operation in Gaza say they feel unsafe revealing their identities. The message to Ms. Power explains that “we sign this letter anonymously out of concern for our personal safety and risk of potentially losing our jobs.”

Dozens of State Department officials have also sent at least three diplomatic cables to Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken urging the United States to exert more pressure on Israel to limit civilian casualties and call for a cease-fire. Those internal cables are signed by name but have not been released to the public.

Hundreds of congressional staffers have also signed multiple open letters calling for the United States to restrain Israel, including by calling for a cease-fire. At a staff walkout outside the Capitol this month, dissenting aides wore masks to conceal their identities.

U.S. officials say that dissenters must understand that working in government often means carrying out policies with which a person disagrees — and that, if doing so becomes morally intolerable, the person should resign their position.

Only one Biden official is known to have resigned in protest over the war in Gaza: Josh Paul, who served as the director of congressional and public affairs for the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs for more than 11 years. In a letter explaining his departure, he criticized the administration’s “blind support for one side” in the conflict.

Ms. Soifer, now the chief executive of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said the letters and other demonstrations of dissent might create the impression that Mr. Biden’s policies are more unpopular than they really are.

She cited an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted early this month that found that half of Democrats approved of Mr. Biden’s handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ms. Soifer also noted that most Democrats in Congress were “completely aligned” with his policies.

At the same time, a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted this week found that 77 percent of Democrats believed Israel should call a cease-fire and seek to negotiate, in contrast to Mr. Biden’s view."
50,50,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/world/middleeast/jerusalem-shooting.html,"At least three people were killed and six others wounded when two Palestinian gunmen affiliated with Hamas opened fire near a bus stop on the outskirts of Jerusalem on Thursday morning, according to the Israeli authorities.

Israel has been on high alert since the Hamas-led attacks last month. The shooting on Thursday was the deadliest to hit the capital since Israel launched a retaliatory war against Hamas in Gaza, and came just as a fragile truce between the two sides was extended.

Israel’s Shin Bet security service said that the gunmen were Palestinian brothers from East Jerusalem who were affiliated with Hamas, the armed group that controls most of Gaza, and that both had been jailed for what it called “terrorist activity.” In a statement, it identified them as Murad Nimr, 38, and Ibrahim Nimr, 30.

Hamas said the men were members of its armed wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades. In a statement on the Telegram messaging app, Hamas — which the United States and many other nations classify as a terrorist group — called the attack “a natural response” to Israel’s “brutal massacres” in Gaza.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Tel Aviv on Thursday as part of a diplomatic push by the Biden administration to extend the truce in Gaza. He said the attack was a reminder “of the threat from terrorism that Israel and Israelis face every single day.”

“My heart goes out to the victims of this attack,” Mr. Blinken said, adding, “We’re thinking of them, we’re thinking of their families, their loved ones, and we mourn their loss.

Benny Gantz, an Israeli politician and member of the country’s wartime emergency government, said the deadly shooting only strengthened Israel’s resolve “to continue the fighting with might and determination against the murderous terrorism which threatens our citizens.”"
53,53,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/world/israel-lebanon-al-mayadeen-journalists-killed.html,"As cross-border clashes intensified between Israel and the armed group Hezbollah, three people, including two television journalists, were killed in an Israeli strike on Tuesday in southern Lebanon, Lebanese officials said.

The Lebanese military and Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister blamed Israel for the attack. The Israeli military said the episode was under review, adding that its soldiers were responding to a Hezbollah threat and that they subsequently became aware of reports that journalists in the area had been killed by Israeli forces.

Al-Mayadeen, a pan-Arab network based in Beirut, said in a statement that Farah Omar, a reporter, and Rabih Al-Maamari, a cameraman, were killed in the attack. A third civilian was also killed in the strike, which took place about four miles from the Israeli border near the Lebanese town of Tayr Harfa, according to Lebanon’s state-run news agency.

The journalists were killed shortly after a live broadcast, Al-Mayadeen said. A video filmed by Mohammed Zinati, a reporter with the local media organization Sawt Beirut, and a photograph of the immediate aftermath showed three bodies lying beside a shallow crater and shrapnel damage to a nearby tree and wall.

Marc Garlasco, a former Pentagon senior intelligence analyst who reviewed the images, told The New York Times that a small hole visible inside a crater and the damage to the tree and wall was “prototypical of a Spike NLOS crater,” a weapon fired only by Israel’s military and not Lebanese forces, he said. “The small cubic fragments in the tree are exactly what I look for,” Mr. Garlasco said.

Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, blamed Israel for the killings, saying in a statement: “This attack proves once again that there are no limits to Israel’s crimes.”

Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia, said it retaliated swiftly to the strike by targeting Israeli soldiers with guided missiles and by hitting an Israeli military base with Grad rockets.

The Lebanese militant group also claimed responsibility for a separate missile attack on a factory in northern Israel belonging to Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, a weapons maker owned by Israel’s Defense Ministry. The militia said it was in response to an Israeli airstrike last week that the country’s military said targeted an “advanced” surface-to-air missile system that had downed an Israeli drone.

The Israeli military said that there were “a number of launches from Lebanon,” but offered no specifics.

Casualties are mounting on both sides of the border, which has grown increasingly volatile since Hamas — which, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran — carried out its devastating terror attacks against Israel on Oct. 7. Israel has responded with airstrikes and a ground invasion of Gaza, and Hezbollah has stepped up its cross-border attacks in solidarity with Hamas, raising fears of a wider regional conflict.

On Monday, Hezbollah claimed responsibility for a powerful cross-border rocket attack on an Israeli military base, prompting a sustained Israeli response that targeted Hezbollah positions, but also caused heavy damage to civilian homes, according to photographs verified by The New York Times.

Also Tuesday, an Israeli strike killed a woman in the southern village of Kfar Kila, and four other people traveling in a car near the southern city of Tyre, according to Lebanon’s state-run news agency.

The chairman of Al-Mayadeen, Ghassan Bin Jedo, questioned the timing of the journalists’ deaths, noting during an interview aired by the network that the Israeli government last week banned its broadcasts after some officials accused it of being a Hezbollah mouthpiece.

The journalists for Al-Mayadeen are the latest to be killed in the escalating violence in Lebanon. Last month, a Reuters videographer, Issam Abdallah, died in a missile strike fired from the direction of Israel.

A total of at least 50 journalists have been killed amid the Israel-Hamas war, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, making it one of the deadliest periods for reporters since the media watchdog first began gathering data in 1992.

In the darkness at Al-Shifa Hospital on Thursday night, it was unclear where the shaft led or how deep it went, although the military said it had sent a drone down at least several meters. Electrical wiring was visible inside, along with a metal staircase.

Colonel Tsury acknowledged the pressure on Israel to show evidence of Hamas activity at the hospital, but said it might be days before troops descended into the shaft. He added that soldiers were methodically searching the complex and had discovered weapons, explosives and computers.

Another military official said Israeli troops had captured and interrogated a Hamas operative at the hospital, but offered no further detail.

Israel has the backing of the Biden administration in its assertion that Hamas is operating under the Al-Shifa complex. Senior U.S. officials said on Friday that they remained confident that Hamas and Palestinian militants have been using hospitals as command centers and ammunition depots, based on intercepted communications between fighters operating in the territory.

At the same time, the Biden administration has cautioned Israel not to conduct airstrikes against Gaza’s hospitals, where thousands of Palestinians continue to take refuge.

Amid pressure from European allies and a resolution by the U.N. Security Council calling for greater aid to civilians in Gaza, Israel on Friday agreed to permit two tankers of fuel to enter the Gaza Strip on a daily basis. The fuel will be used to run desalination and sewage plants, Israeli officials said.

The decision followed a request by the Biden administration and was described by Israel’s national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, as a way to prevent the spread of disease among civilians and Israeli soldiers.

“We want to prevent the spread of epidemics,” Mr. Hanegbi said. “We don’t need epidemics that will hurt the civilians and our soldiers who are there. If there’s disease, the fighting will stop. We will be unable to continue given the humanitarian crisis and the international outcry.”

Until Friday, the Israeli authorities had permitted almost no additional fuel to enter Gaza since the Oct. 7 attacks.

The United Nations World Food Program warned on Thursday that the entire population of Gaza — 2.2 million, half of them children — was in need of food assistance and at risk of starvation because of a collapsed food supply chain and insufficient aid delivery.

“We are already starting to see cases of dehydration and malnutrition, which is increasing rapidly,” Abeer Etefa, a spokeswoman for the program, told reporters at the U.N. “People are facing immediate possibility of starvation.”"
55,55,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/world/middleeast/al-shifa-hospital-israel.html,"What Israel finds — or doesn’t — in the hospital could affect international sentiment about the invasion and influence the negotiations taking place on freeing more than 200 hostages being held by Hamas.

Eighteen hours after the raid on the hospital began, the Israeli military released photos and video that it said backed its assertions. It distributed images of 13 guns that it said its soldiers had discovered in the hospital, as well as a statement saying that it had found a military command center in the hospital’s M.R.I. unit.

In a video taken at the hospital, a military spokesman, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, displayed caches of guns, ammunition, protective vests and Hamas military uniforms, some of which, he said, had been hidden behind M.R.I. machines and others in nearby storage units.

The New York Times was unable to verify the provenance of the weapons and equipment in the images or assess the claim of the command center’s existence. Apart from a gunfight outside the hospital at the start of the raid, there were no reports of clashes with Hamas gunmen at the site.

In a statement, Hamas dismissed the Israeli account as “a fabricated story that no one would believe.”

Should the Israelis in the end be unable to come up with compelling evidence that the hospital was used to house troops, store weapons and command fighters, they may find that the time left to achieve their stated goal — removing Hamas from power — has been curtailed. Israel’s targeting of Al-Shifa has already drawn global concern; a failure to prove the raid’s necessity could make Israel’s international partners less supportive of further Israeli operations in Gaza.

A spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council, John F. Kirby, rejecting Hamas claims that the United States had given the raid on Al-Shifa a “green light,” said Wednesday that Israel had not alerted the White House ahead of time.

The war began on Oct. 7, after Hamas led a terrorist attack on Israel, killing an estimated 1,200 people and kidnapping roughly 240 others, according to Israeli officials. In the 40 days since, Israel’s counterattack — by air, sea and land — has killed more than 11,000 people in Gaza, including more than 4,600 children, according to health officials in Gaza.

Israel is pushing to oust Hamas from power and re-establish control over a territory that it occupied in 1967; in 2005, it disbanded its settlements there. Since 2007, when Hamas took full control of the narrow coastal enclave, Israel, in unison with Egypt, has maintained a tight blockade on Gaza.

Initially, at least, the raid on Wednesday seemed to pass without major bloodshed.

Israeli soldiers briefly exchanged fire with gunmen outside the hospital before entering, a senior military official said.

The hospital director, Mohammad Abu Salmiya, said in a broadcast interview with Al Jazeera that the soldiers had destroyed a wall of the hospital compound before entering, shattering several windows and wounding people inside with shrapnel.

“We can see the tanks before our eyes and we can see the soldiers walking inside the hospital,” he said."

Some families were split up, with women and children sent home as male relatives remained behind — including Abraham Munder, 78, Ohad’s grandfather.

“We’re happy, but we’re not celebrating. There are still other hostages in captivity,” Roy Zichri, Ohad’s brother, said in a video statement. “We need to keep up the struggle until all the hostages are freed — every last one,” he added.

Yaffa Adar, 85, had been captured in Nir Oz was taken on a scooter toward the Gaza Strip by her captors in one of the assault’s most iconic images. She was freed on Friday, while one of her eight grandchildren, Tamir, is still being held in Gaza, according to her family.

“One stone is now removed from our heart, but we are still missing parts of it,” said Moran Aloni, whose sister and niece were freed on Friday, but who still has several other relatives held hostage in Gaza.

Prof. Gilat Livni, who is overseeing the treatment of the returned child hostages at the Schneider children’s hospital, said the four Israeli children who had returned were “overall in generally good condition” despite the trauma they had been through.

“Both the mothers and the children are speaking, telling stories and sharing their experiences,” Professor Livni told reporters, calling it “astonishing and emotional.”

But the returned hostages now require a prolonged period of physical and mental rehabilitation, said Hagai Levine, a physician who is advising the families of hostages held captive in Gaza.

“It’s a long process of restoring a sense of trust, control, and functioning, after they were in a situation where they had no control over their fate,” said Dr. Levine, adding that many of the freed hostages had no home to which to return, complicating their recovery.

Before the temporary cease-fire, Hamas had freed four Israelis, citing “humanitarian reasons.” Dr. Levine met at least two of them: Judith Raanan, a dual Israeli-American citizen, and Yocheved Lifshitz.

“I was impressed by their ability not only to recover, but to offer help to other families,” Dr. Levine said. “But the process is long, and there’s definitely trauma” to be dealt with, he added."
57,57,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/opinion/bernie-sanders-israel-gaza.html,"There have been five wars in the last 15 years between Israel and Hamas. How do we end the current one and prevent a sixth from happening, sooner or later? How do we balance our desire to stop the fighting with the need to address the roots of the conflict? For 75 years, diplomats, well-intentioned Israelis and Palestinians and government leaders around the world have struggled to bring peace to this region. In that time an Egyptian president and an Israeli prime minister were assassinated by extremists for their efforts to end the violence.

And on and on it goes.

For those of us who want not only to bring this war to an end, but to avoid a future one, we must first be cleareyed about facts. On Oct. 7, Hamas, a terrorist organization, unleashed a barbaric attack against Israel, killing about 1,200 innocent men, women and children and taking more than 200 hostage. On a per-capita basis, if Israel had the same population as the United States, that attack would have been the equivalent of nearly 40,000 deaths, more than 10 times the fatalities that we suffered on 9/11.

Israel, in response, under the leadership of its right-wing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under indictment for corruption and whose cabinet includes outright racists, unleashed what amounts to total war against the Palestinian people. In Gaza, over 1.6 million Palestinians were forced out of their homes. Food, water, medical supplies and fuel were cut off. The United Nations estimates that 45 percent of the housing units in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed. According to the Gaza health ministry, more than 12,000 Palestinians, about half of whom are children, have been killed and many more wounded. And the situation becomes more dire every day.

This is a humanitarian catastrophe that risks igniting a wider regional conflagration. We all want it to end as soon as possible. To make progress, however, we must grapple with the complexity of this situation that too many people on both sides want to wave away.

First, Hamas has made it clear, before and after Oct. 7, that its goal is perpetual warfare and the destruction of the state of Israel. Just last week a spokesman for Hamas told The New York Times: “I hope that the state of war with Israel will become permanent on all the borders, and that the Arab world will stand with us.”

Second, Israel has done nothing in recent years to give hope for a peaceful settlement — maintaining the blockade of Gaza, deepening the daily humiliations of occupation in the West Bank, and largely ignoring the horrendous living conditions facing Palestinians.

Needless to say, I do not have all of the answers to this never-ending tragedy. But for those of us who believe in peace and justice, it is imperative that we do our best to provide Israelis and Palestinians with a thoughtful response that maps out a realistic path to addressing the reality we face today. Here are my thoughts as to the best way forward and how the United States can rally the world around a moral position that moves us toward peace in the region and justice for the oppressed Palestinian population.

To start, we must demand an immediate end to Israel’s indiscriminate bombing, which is causing an enormous number of civilian casualties and is in violation of international law. Israel is at war with Hamas, not innocent Palestinian men, women and children. Israel cannot bomb an entire neighborhood to take out one Hamas target. We don’t know if this campaign has been effective in degrading Hamas’s military capabilities. But we do know that a reported 70 percent of the casualties are women and children, and that 104 U.N. aid workers and 53 journalists have been killed. That’s not acceptable.

There must also be a significant, extended humanitarian pause so that badly needed aid — food, water, medicine and fuel — can get into Gaza and save lives. If Wednesday morning’s deal — in which 50 Israeli hostages are to be freed in exchange for a four-day pause in fighting — is honored, it is a promising first step that we can build upon, and hopefully work to extend the pause. Meanwhile, the United Nations must be given time to safely set up the distribution network needed to prevent thirst, starvation and disease, to build shelters and evacuate those who need critical care. This window will also allow for talks to free as many hostages as possible. This extended pause must not precede a resumption of indiscriminate bombing. Israel will continue to go after Hamas, but it must dramatically change its tactics to minimize civilian harm.

If long-suffering Palestinians are ever going to have a chance at self-determination and a decent standard of living, there must be no long-term Israeli re-occupation and blockade of Gaza. If Hamas is going to be removed from power, as it must be, and Palestinians given the opportunity for a better life, an Israeli occupation of Gaza would be absolutely counterproductive and would benefit Hamas. For the sake of regional peace and a brighter future for the Palestinian people, Gaza must have a chance to be free of Hamas. There can be no long-term Israeli occupation.

To achieve the political transformation that Gaza needs, new Palestinian leadership will be required as part of a wider political process. And for that transformation and peace process to take place, Israel must make certain political commitments that will allow for Palestinian leadership committed to peace to build support. They must guarantee displaced Palestinians the absolute right to return to their homes as Gaza rebuilds. People who have lived in poverty and despair for years cannot be made permanently homeless. Israel must also commit to end the killings of Palestinians in the West Bank and freeze settlements there as a first step toward permanently ending the occupation. Those steps will show that peace can deliver for the Palestinian people, hopefully giving the Palestinian Authority the legitimacy it needs to assume administrative control of Gaza, likely after an interim stabilization period under an international force.

Finally, if Palestinians are to have any hope for a decent future, there must be a commitment to broad peace talks to advance a two-state solution in the wake of this war. The United States, the international community and Israel’s neighbors must move aggressively toward that goal. This would include dramatically increased international support for the Palestinian people, including from wealthy Gulf States. It would also mean the promise of full recognition of Palestine pending the formation of a new democratically elected government committed to peace with Israel.

Let’s be clear: this is not going to happen on its own. Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud party was explicitly formed on the premise that “between the Sea and the Jordan [River] there will only be Israeli sovereignty,” and the current coalition agreement reinforces that goal. This is not just ideology. The Israeli government has systematically pursued this goal. The last year saw record Israeli settlement growth in the West Bank, where more than 700,000 Israelis now live in areas that the United Nations and the United States agree are occupied territories. They have used state violence to back up this de facto annexation. Since Oct. 7, the United Nations reports that at least 208 Palestinians, including 53 children, have been killed by Israeli security forces and settlers. This cannot be allowed to continue.

Mr. Netanyahu has made clear where he stands on these critical issues. So should we. If asking nicely worked, we wouldn’t be in this position. The only way these necessary changes will happen is if the United States uses the substantial leverage we have with Israel. And we all know what that leverage is.

For many years, the United States has provided Israel substantial sums of money — with close to no strings attached. Currently, we provide $3.8 billion a year. President Biden has asked for $14.3 billion more on top of that sum and asked Congress to waive normal, already-limited oversight rules. The blank check approach must end. The United States must make clear that while we are friends of Israel, there are conditions to that friendship and that we cannot be complicit in actions that violate international law and our own sense of decency. That includes an end to indiscriminate bombing; a significant pause to bombing so that massive humanitarian assistance can come into the region; the right of displaced Gazans to return to their homes; no long-term Israeli occupation of Gaza; an end to settler violence in the West Bank and a freeze on settlement expansion; and a commitment to broad peace talks for a two-state solution in the wake of the war.

Over the years, people of good will around the world, including Israelis, have tried to address this conflict in a way that brings justice for Palestinians and security for Israel. I, and some other members of Congress, have tried to do what we could. Obviously, we did not do enough. Now we must recommit to this effort. The stakes are just too high to give up."
58,58,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/world/middleeast/released-hostages-israel-gaza-hamas.html,"After nearly seven weeks in captivity, 13 Israeli hostages abducted by Hamas and other groups during the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel were released on Friday as part of a deal that paused the fighting in the Gaza Strip.

The 13 — all women and children — were returned to Israel. Five other hostages had been released or rescued earlier in the fighting.

Twelve of those newly released were among roughly 75 people who had been kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7. One of the 13 was among those taken from Kibbutz Nirim.

In addition, 10 Thais and one Filipino were freed, but details about their identities have not been released."
59,59,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostage-negotiations.html,"After weeks of negotiations, officials from Israel and Hamas said early Wednesday that they had reached an agreement for a brief cease-fire in Gaza and the release of 50 of the about 240 hostages taken by the armed group on Oct. 7.

The Israeli decision, announced by the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said that his government had approved the “framework” for a hostage release over four days, during which there would be a pause in the fighting. Less than an hour later, Hamas said in a statement that it had agreed to a cease-fire and to free hostages in exchange for the release of 150 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

Qatar, the lead mediator of the talks, said on Thursday the cease-fire in Gaza would begin at 7 a.m. local time Friday.

Here’s what we know about the agreement:

A four-day cease-fire would be the longest halt in fighting since Oct. 7. During the pause, women and children will be released over four days. Israel said that it would extend the cease-fire by a day for every 10 additional hostages released by Hamas. A pause would bring some measure of relief to Gaza’s 2.2 million civilians, more than two-thirds of whom have been displaced and pushed to the limits of survival with diminishing supplies of food and water.

Israel said 50 women and children would be freed in the “first stage” of the hostage release. The Israeli government had publicly taken a hard line on hostages, saying repeatedly that there would be no cease-fire until captives are released. One Israeli official said that some in the government had wanted all the hostages to be released at once. In closed-door talks, though, there appears to have been wiggle room in Israel’s stance. Israel said that the agreement announced early Wednesday was the “first stage” toward its goal of bringing all the hostages home.

Hamas said 150 Palestinian prisoners would be released and that more aid would be allowed into Gaza. Hamas had previously said it was seeking a full cease-fire and the release of all Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, and added as a new condition the delivery of fuel to Gaza’s collapsing hospitals. On Wednesday, the group said in its statement that “a humanitarian truce” had been reached, pursuant to which hundreds of trucks with aid and fuel for humanitarian needs would be let into the territory during the cease-fire. It added that despite the truce, “Our hands will remain on the trigger.”

Hostages are expected to be released later Friday. Majed al-Ansari, a spokesman for Qatar’s foreign ministry, told reporters that some hostages would be released starting at 4 p.m. on Friday.

60,60,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/us/march-for-israel-washington-dc-rally.html,"Demonstrators from across the United States gathered on Tuesday on the National Mall in Washington in a vast show of solidarity with Israel as it wages war in the Gaza Strip in response to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.

The rally, called the March for Israel, was intended by organizers to respond to critics of Israel, where about 1,200 people were killed in the attack, and meant as a loud signal to U.S. politicians not to waver in support for Israel as calls grew for a cease-fire. In speeches by lawmakers invited to address the rally, there were no signs of such wavering.

“We ache with you, we stand with you and we will not rest until you get all the assistance you need,” said Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and, as Senate majority leader, the highest-ranking Jewish elected official in the country.

Following Mr. Schumer in a bipartisan lineup of speakers was Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana and the new speaker of the House. “The calls for a cease-fire are outrageous,” he said, setting off a “No cease-fire” chant from the crowd. “Israel will cease their counteroffensive when Hamas ceases to be a threat to the Jewish state.”

The march was arranged in a matter of days by the Jewish Federations of North America and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Schools, synagogues and community centers sent buses of attendees. By the time speeches began, the Mall was crowded with people from Los Angeles, Houston, Miami, Boston, Philadelphia and other places around the country, waving American and Israeli flags and holding signs declaring support.

Over the course of the event, tens of thousands of people had converged on the Mall, the national park that sits between the U.S. Capitol and the Washington Monument. The U.S. Park Police, which has jurisdiction, does not provide official crowd estimates, nor does the city’s Metropolitan Police Department.

Tamara Wilkof, 71, was among the hundreds who had come to Washington on around two dozen buses from Cleveland. “It’s definitely a unity message,” she said, adding that she believed people had been galvanized by the surge in antisemitism since the attack. A fellow marcher mentioned that a Jewish cemetery in the Cleveland suburbs was vandalized with antisemitic graffiti last weekend."
62,62,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/12/opinion/israel-gaza-war-crimes.html,"Israel’s response to the horrifying Hamas attack on Oct. 7 has caused widespread protest among its critics and soul-searching among some of its supporters. The deaths of thousands of Palestinian civilians in a ferocious bombing campaign and an increasingly intense ground war in the Gaza Strip cry out for a careful examination of the moral basis for Israel’s actions.

The most prominent moral framework that applies is “just war” theory, which has guided Western thought for centuries and forms the intellectual framework for international law on the use of force. Based on works by thinkers ranging from Roman philosophers to modern-day jurists, just-war theory offers a time-honored set of criteria to consider whether and how force should be used — though it is admittedly impossible for any analysis to be absolutely impartial.

The standard elements used in assessing whether a war is just are just cause, right intent, legitimate authority, net benefit or likelihood of success, last resort, proportionality of means and noncombatant distinction. Ideally a state should meet all of the criteria, but the case for a just war can still be made even if a few of the benchmarks are weak.

While Israel easily has just cause and constitutes a legitimate authority, its case is far weaker regarding the other five criteria. In addition, the fact that Hamas has violated these principles does not absolve Israel from an obligation to live up to higher moral standards.

While applying these standards to Israel is ultimately a theoretical exercise, a perception that it falls short could have major practical effects, potentially damaging Israel’s diplomatic standing and trade and the world economy while strengthening support for its enemies. If Israel is widely seen to have committed war crimes, a trial could be held at the International Criminal Court in The Hague — though Israel does not recognize its jurisdiction — or Israeli soldiers could be arrested and tried in any of the nations that have adopted universal jurisdiction to prosecute such crimes.

To determine how just or unjust are Israel’s current actions, let’s examine each criterion and the evidence, based on the approach in my scholarship examining some 20 conflicts.

On the first measure, just cause, Israel would seem to have plenty of that, given its inherent right to self-defense, as provided for in the United Nations Charter. Even Israel’s declared aim of eliminating Hamas — though perhaps more properly formulated as destroying the fighting capacity of Hamas — seems well justified, especially as rockets continue to fly into Israel. Certainly, the rescue of Israeli hostages held in Gaza is a meritorious goal.

Right intent, the second criterion, means that force should be used to help establish peace in the long term, rather than in pursuit of a short-term or politically self-serving gain or in an act of vengeance. Though some might argue that Israel is fighting to establish peace in Gaza from a position of strength and dominance, Israeli actions can easily be questioned. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governments have scant history of genuinely seeking peace, even with the more pliable Palestinian Authority and even with the road map of the Oslo Accords. Israel recognized the United States-backed two-state solution, but the current government has made no progress toward carrying it out, and several ministers actively oppose such a plan. Instead, the steady growth of settlements has resulted in the de facto confiscation of Palestinian land.

The Israeli government does satisfy the criterion of having legitimate authority. The government was democratically elected, even if Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition has sought to undermine the checks and balances provided by the Israeli judiciary.

The criterion of net benefit, weighing the gain against the harm, would include the potential gain of removing Hamas from power or at least neutralizing its capacity to attack Israel in the short term. The war might also provide new opportunities for the Palestinian Authority or some other transitional administration to govern Gaza, and eventually free and fair elections. Israel might also be able to rescue the hostages held by Hamas. However, the enormous loss of Palestinian lives will most likely create intergenerational rage against Israel and catalyze recruitment for extremist groups. Even if Hamas is effectively disarmed and loses control of Gaza, more extremist groups are likely to spring up.

Further, there is a great risk of a wider war, with fire already being exchanged over Israel’s borders with Lebanon and Syria, and escalating violence in the West Bank. Damage to Israel’s foreign relations is also likely: the suspension of peace talks with Saudi Arabia and possible withdrawals from the Abraham Accords, which Israel recently signed with certain Arab states with the goal of normalizing relations.

So the downside of Israel’s war outweighs any benefit.

The criterion of last resort is key to all just-war considerations. Force should be used only when all other means have failed or would be clearly ineffective. Israel sees no other way to neutralize Hamas and rescue the hostages. But it has forsworn direct negotiations out of hand, and it is not considering a peace process for Gaza. Mr. Netanyahu has dismissed Hamas’s proposed deals for the release of hostages. He has said that he does not want to negotiate with Hamas, though we know that negotiation with adversaries, however distasteful, has often proven successful.

Proportionality of means is an important principle to uphold during fighting. Civilian casualties and damage in Gaza have been far in excess of any military advantage gained by Israel and thus not proportionate. Demanding the almost immediate evacuation of half the population of over two million to the southern part of the Gaza Strip is unrealistic, especially as corridors of travel are extremely hazardous. Israel has attacked Gaza, including the southern part, with ferocity. The death toll of many thousands is climbing alarmingly.

Noncombatant distinction is another major criterion for a just war. Civilians should not be targeted. Israel can rightly claim that its ground invasion helps Israeli forces better distinguish Hamas fighters from civilians. Israel accepts the risk of sending in soldiers instead of carpet bombing to destroy Hamas. Furthermore, the extensive labyrinth of tunnels underground, probably holding hostages, need to be cordoned off and searched. But engaging in urban warfare is exceedingly difficult and leads to soldiers killing civilians, especially as Hamas fighters hide among the population. The ethics of using force to overcome the use of human shields is debated among international human rights lawyers, but any future trials of both Israeli and Hamas fighters can examine each specific situation.

In any case, a law-abiding combatant must find ways to reduce civilian casualties to a bare minimum.

Israel claims it is not deliberately targeting civilians, but this is hard to reconcile with the extreme level of death and destruction in the first month of its response, including bombings that destroy entire apartment buildings. Furthermore, significant human suffering has resulted from shortages in electricity, water, food, fuel and medical supplies in Gaza because of Israel’s blockade. Humanitarian aid has been stifled for weeks. A U.N. agency said that more than 100 of its employees have been killed and at least one U.N. school has been bombed.

Just-war theory reinforces the human instinct to not only preserve human life but also lament its loss, and to try to find solutions. Israel’s conduct will be judged not only by theorists but by the nations and peoples of the world as well. It will also help determine Israel’s place in history. Hopefully, that prospect will turn the Israeli government toward peace, and solutions other than war."
63,63,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/world/middleeast/hostages-hamas-israel-captivity.html,"Hostages freed by Hamas are experiencing bursts of euphoria followed by emotional crashes as they emerge from weeks of paralyzing fear in captivity, according to Israeli relatives who spoke to journalists at the Israeli Embassy in London on Tuesday.

“Everything is just so fragile,” said Limor Sella-Broyde, 40, whose cousins Judith Raanan, 59, and Natalie Raanan, 17, were freed on Oct. 20.

She said the mother and daughter were in difficult psychological states as they recovered. “It’s an adrenaline rush and then a crash,” Ms. Sella-Broyde said. “They try to speak and then they get really tired.”

Three of Ms. Sella-Broyde’s relatives were killed by Hamas during the group’s terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7, while seven others were taken hostage from Kibbutz Be’eri.

Judith and Natalie Raanan, who are dual citizens of Israel and the United States, were the first hostages to be freed from captivity after negotiations involving the United States, Qatar and other nations. But for their family, any sense of relief remains out of reach because so many other members remain captive, and because the life they knew in the kibbutz has been shattered.

Ms. Sella-Broyde was part of a small group of Israelis brought to London this week to speak about their experiences related to the Oct. 7 attacks and to raise the profiles of the many other hostages who remain in captivity.

The event, sponsored by an Israeli charity, appeared designed in part to refocus public attention on Oct. 7, at a time when much of that attention has shifted to Israeli airstrikes and military operations in Gaza that have caused thousands of civilian deaths.

But the Israelis who spoke on Tuesday were reluctant to give details of the ordeals their family members had gone through in Gaza or describe their medical conditions after being released, citing a desire to protect their privacy.

Ms. Sella-Broyde said that she was nervous about broaching difficult topics with Judith and Natalie Raanan. “They are broken,” she said.

Another member of the group who spoke, Shahar Mor, 52, said that four of his family members had been kidnapped on Oct. 7. Three of them, including Ohad Munder Zichri, 9, have since been released, but the family’s patriarch, Avraham Munder, 78, has not.

Mr. Mor said that when his relatives were first freed, the family members simply hugged one another. But he added that he was dogged by a feeling of horror at the events of Oct. 7 and by worry for Mr. Munder.

In captivity, Mr. Mor said, his relatives had subsisted mainly on pita bread, which became more scarce as the weeks went by, and they ate with their guards. One guard gave them a pack of cards, which helped to pass the time, he said.

Mr. Mor downplayed the significance of the gesture, arguing that one humane act by a Hamas guard should not distract from the group’s ruthlessness.

“Some of the captors are nicer; some are less nice,” he said. “It makes no difference.”"
64,64,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostage-deal.html,"Israel believes that Wednesday’s raid on Al-Shifa Hospital will put pressure on Hamas to finish a deal to trade dozens of Israeli captives for Palestinian prisoners, according to two senior Israeli officials.

Negotiations for a deal are underway, with the various players working on a framework of an agreement, according to the two Israeli officials, who are involved in the Israeli effort to release the hostages through a deal, as well as a third with knowledge of the matter. Under the proposal, Hamas would release 50 women and children abducted during the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks for roughly the same number of Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons.

The three officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations as did two other Israeli officials who discussed the hostage negotiations.

The deal, being negotiated by Qatari, Egyptian and American officials, would also include the cessation of hostilities for several days, a so-called humanitarian pause, four of the officials said.

Hamas confirmed the broad outlines of this agreement on Tuesday but blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel for delaying it.

“We want your children returned to you,” Osama Hamdan, a Hamas spokesman, told reporters on Tuesday in Beirut, “but the one who is obstructing you is Netanyahu and his war government.”

In addition to about 1,200 people killed in the Oct. 7 attack, there were also 240 hostages taken to Gaza, according to Israeli officials. After the attack, Israel declared war on Hamas, which according to health officials in Hamas-controlled Gaza has resulted in more than 10,000 deaths. Freeing the hostages — and ensuring their survival during the war — is one of Israel’s declared targets but also among its most tactically difficult and politically fraught challenges.

Despite movement from both sides toward a deal, Mr. Netanyahu must first present the proposal to his government for a vote.

Until prisoners are actually being exchanged, the situation remains fluid. The swap could be scuttled by hard-liners in Israel’s government who do not want to make any deal with Hamas, or who want Israel to secure the release of more hostages.

The deal was being worked out by officials from the tiny Gulf emirate of Qatar, which has hosted the Hamas political leadership in exile for years. The United States and Israel have long used Qatar as an intermediary to get messages to Hamas and to coordinate aid efforts in Gaza.

Hamas is willing to release at least 50 women and children, two of the officials said. Israel, they said, believes the total number of women and children that Hamas is holding is closer to 100 and is pushing for more hostages to be released in the deal, though so far without success.

Two of the Israeli officials said Hamas has not provided the names of the hostages it is willing to trade but that the sides have agreed that members of the same family would not be separated.

Under the proposal, some of the exchanges, they added, would take place at the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza — the only functioning entrance to the enclave and the site at which Israel has allowed foreign aid to enter the strip.

An earlier proposed agreement that would have seen the release of 50 hostages in exchange for a temporary cease-fire was derailed last month, at least in part, by Israel’s decision to send ground troops into Gaza after weeks of airstrikes. But Israel believes that by taking Shifa, which it says Hamas uses as a military command center and its patients as human shields, the militant group is deprived of a key asset and more inclined to trade hostages, according to officials. Hamas and hospital officials deny its use as a military facility.

Hamas previously released a small number of hostages in two rounds last month — an American mother and her daughter who also have Israeli citizenship, and later two elderly Israeli women.

The cease-fire, reached after weeks of painstaking negotiation with the help of Egypt, Qatar and the United States, had held for a few hours before word emerged that anyone had been released. Then came a flurry of announcements from Egypt, Qatar and the International Committee of the Red Cross, which helped receive hostages after their weeks in captivity in Gaza.

The hostages released included 13 Israelis, several children among them, as well as 10 Thais and one Filipino — reflecting the large number of foreign farm laborers in Israel, and the far-reaching effects of the Hamas attacks on Israel last month.

Not long after those hostages were declared free, Qatar’s Foreign Ministry said that 39 Palestinian women and minors imprisoned by the Israeli authorities had been released. All the hostages freed by Hamas were expected to be swiftly moved to Israel to receive urgent medical care.

The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said in a statement that the military and the country’s foreign intelligence agency, Mossad, had received a list of hostages slated to be released on Saturday, and that security officials were reviewing the list.

Israel has said that it would extend the cease-fire by a day for every 10 additional hostages that Hamas releases. Hamas has not commented directly on the offer but its top political official, Ismail Haniyeh, said his group was committed to making the truce work.

An extended pause in the fighting would give Gaza’s civilians the first sustained relief after nearly 50 days of relentless bombardment, which has shattered homes, debilitated hospitals and left more than two million people in desperate conditions.

But it would also allow both Israel and Hamas to try to better their positions for battles to come. Hamas, which has been battered by Israel’s bombardment and ground invasion, could try to regroup its forces and fortify the places it holds. Israel may be able to glean new intelligence during the pause, and so make plans for its next phase of the war. Israeli leaders have vowed to eradicate Hamas, and the group has said “our hands will remain on the trigger.”

The exchange of captives, and the arrival of the biggest aid convoy Gaza has received in weeks, was cautiously welcomed by President Biden and set off waves of emotion in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. Tension broke into relief for some families and anguish for those whose loved ones were not among those released.

Hundreds of people gathered late Friday outside the Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank, waiting for the first group of Palestinians to be released, and Israeli forces fired tear gas several times to keep people back from the gates."

“If we are ever going to bring peace to that region,” Mr. Sanders said in remarks that drew cheers and applause from the audience, “we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity.” He added, “That does not make me anti-Israel.”

The comment delighted liberal critics of Israel’s policies in the occupied West Bank and Gaza and alarmed mainstream Democrats, who were more accustomed to seeing presidential candidates compete to showcase their airtight alignment with the Jewish state. It was an early indication of what would become a profound divide within the Democratic Party over Israel, pitting young progressives and people of color against older, whiter and more pro-Israel voters, and it positioned Mr. Sanders, the progressive icon from Vermont, on the leading edge of it.

But years later, amid the latest war in Gaza that began after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking around 240 hostage, Mr. Sanders has found himself at odds with many of the same progressive activists and groups who powered his presidential campaigns and once revered him for his willingness to publicly question the actions of the Jewish state."
67,67,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-rhetoric.html,"Shock, grief and pain have cascaded across Israel since Hamas gunmen poured out of Gaza to kill an estimated 1,200 Israeli civilians and soldiers on Oct. 7. So have anger and a thirst for vengeance, which the country’s leaders are verbalizing in language that critics in Israel say often crosses the line into incitement.

“We are fighting human animals, and we are acting accordingly,” said Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, two days after the attacks, as he described how the Israeli military planned to eradicate Hamas in Gaza.

“We’re fighting Nazis,” declared Naftali Bennett, a former prime minister.

“You must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible — we do remember,” said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, referring to the ancient enemy of the Israelites, in scripture interpreted by scholars as a call to exterminate their “men and women, children and infants.”

Inflammatory language has also been used by journalists, retired generals, celebrities, and social media influencers, according to experts who track the statements. Calls for Gaza to be “flattened,” “erased” or “destroyed” had been mentioned about 18,000 times since Oct. 7 in Hebrew posts on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, said FakeReporter, an Israeli group that monitors disinformation and hate speech. The phrases were only mentioned 16 times in the month and a half before the war."
68,68,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-al-shifa-hospital.html,"It was the first of at least four strikes involving multiple munitions on different sections of the sprawling complex between 1 a.m. and 10 a.m. Friday morning. Al-Shifa’s director, Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, said in a phone interview that seven people had been killed and several others had been wounded.

Hours after the final blast, the Israeli military blamed unspecified Palestinian militants, saying a “misfired projectile” aimed at Israel Defense Forces troops deployed nearby had instead hit the hospital.

But at least three of the projectiles that struck it appear to have been Israeli munitions, according to pictures of weapons fragments collected and verified by The New York Times and analyzed by experts.

The strikes did not cause mass casualties, but Israel is under increasing international pressure to avoid targeting hospitals. Al-Shifa has emerged as a particular flashpoint: Israel contends it has evidence that the hospital sits on top of an underground Hamas command center and has been warning those still inside to evacuate, even as its troops have been actively working to surround the facility. Hospital officials deny Hamas operates there and have said patients are dying for lack of food, fuel and other supplies.

Israel’s assertion that Al-Shifa was actually hit by a Palestinian projectile echoed similar — and unresolved — claims and counterclaims following munitions that hit the courtyard of another Gaza hospital, Al-Ahli, nearly a month ago.

The evidence reviewed by The Times from Al-Shifa points more directly to strikes by Israel — whether on purpose or by accident is unclear.

In addition to the weapons remnants, an analysis of video footage shows that three of the projectiles were fired into the hospital from the north and south, contrary to the western trajectory indicated on a map released by the I.D.F., which it said was based on radar detections. A review of satellite images showed there were I.D.F. positions north and south of the hospital early Friday."

Day-to-day interaction between Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza has been drastically reduced by walls and fences in a push for physical separation.

Almost forgotten are the Palestine Liberation Organization’s recognition in 1993 of Israel’s right to exist in peace, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin’s determination to pursue that peace, a decision that cost him his life in 1995 at the hands of an extreme right-wing Israeli assassin who said he acted “on the orders of God.”

These were the ephemeral glimmerings of shared humanity, soon quashed.

In the intervening decades, Hamas and the ultranationalist religious Israeli right have each extended their influence. The conflict now involves fundamentalist religious ideologies, distinct in critical regards but equally convinced that all the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River has been deeded to them by God.

A political and military struggle between two national movements for the same land can be resolved by compromise, at least in theory. France and Germany settled their differences in Alsace-Lorraine. Peace came to Ireland. But absolutist claims of divine right to territory appear impossible to reconcile.

“The humanity of the other is less acknowledged for the simple reason that human contact has become rare,” said Yuval Shany, a professor of international law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Where there is contact, as between Israel’s Jewish and Palestinian populations, some measure of empathy stirs.

In 2014, during an earlier round of Israel-Hamas fighting, I stood in eastern Gaza City, gazing at tangles of iron rods, jagged outcrops of masonry and air thick with dust. At the time, a 9-year-old child in Gaza had memories of three wars in six years and needed no indoctrination in hatred.

Mahmoud al-Zahar, a co-founder of Hamas, whose charter calls for Israel’s destruction, told me in an interview that year: “Israel will be eliminated because it is a foreign body.” Referring to Israeli Jews, he said, “Why should they come from Ethiopia, or Poland or America? There are six million in Palestine. OK, take them. America is very wide. You can make a new district for Jews.”

The delusional fantasy that the enemy can be made to vanish has since grown. “On the Palestinian side, the ideal solution has become that Israel disappear,” Professor Shany said. “On the Israeli side, there is a desire for Gaza to go away, even if that means bombing it away. Of course, that is not a solution.”"
70,70,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/world/middleeast/israel-opposition-lapid-netanyahu.html,"Follow live news updates on the Israel-Hamas war.

Yair Lapid, who leads Israel’s parliamentary opposition, has said that he would join an Israeli government led by the right as long as it excluded the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and some of Mr. Netanyahu’s hard-line partners.

“Israel has lost faith in the prime minister,” Mr. Lapid told the Israeli network Channel 12 in an interview on Wednesday, adding, “We cannot allow ourselves to conduct an extended war with a prime minister that the public does not trust.”

Mr. Netanyahu “must go now,” Mr. Lapid said.

Israel’s political opposition has been fiercely critical of Mr. Netanyahu’s leadership and many have called for his removal in the past. But after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks that the Israeli government has said left more than 1,200 dead last month, most opposition parties rallied around the war effort.

One opposition faction — the National Unity alliance, led by Benny Gantz — joined the emergency wartime government under Mr. Netanyahu. Mr. Lapid, whose Yesh Atid party controls 24 of 120 seats in the Israeli Parliament, or Knesset, rejected an offer to also join.

But public anger against Mr. Netanyahu has mounted since the Hamas attack, with some accusing him of failing to prevent the surprise assault and of overseeing a sluggish government response.

Mr. Netanyahu has refused to say whether he bears any responsibility for the disastrous failure to prevent the assault. Other senior officials, including Israel’s finance minister and several top security chiefs, have publicly said that they failed in their duty to protect the country’s citizens.

Mr. Netanyahu briefly appeared to blame Israel’s security establishment in a post on social media roughly three weeks after the Hamas attack, saying that officials had failed to warn him of the danger. He later apologized for that comment, but has maintained that questions of responsibility should wait until after the war.

Under Mr. Lapid’s proposal, Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party would lead a “government of national reconstruction” after choosing a new leader.

The proposal is almost certainly a nonstarter for Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, who has weathered successive political crises, three criminal cases, and a year and a half out of office before he returned to power in late 2022. So far, no one in his Likud party has publicly discussed ousting him.

In a statement, Likud called Mr. Lapid’s remarks “saddening and shameful,” accusing him of playing politics during wartime and of attempting to replace Mr. Netanyahu with a government that would establish a Palestinian state."
71,71,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/us/politics/hostages-biden.html,"When it was all said and done, the deal to release some of the hostages held by Hamas came down to two critical phone calls ultimately forcing each side to make a tough concession.

The Israelis were insisting that it was not enough to free just 50 of the roughly 240 hostages. They had to have more, they said. At that point, President Biden had to talk Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel into accepting what was on the table and then keep working to recover the rest.

As for Hamas, according to senior administration officials, its leaders were demanding that the pause in fighting incorporated into the agreement last five days, even though the Israelis refused to agree to more than four. Mr. Biden told the emir of Qatar, who was serving as the intermediary with Hamas, that four was all they would get for now.

The path to the hostage deal was painful and painstaking, one marked by fitful progress, deep mistrust, terrible choices and moments when the whole thing was on the verge of unraveling. Neither side got exactly what it wanted. But if the agreement is carried out successfully over the next few days — and that is still an important if — it could serve as a template for further negotiations to free more of the hostages and extend the temporary cease-fire.

“Last night’s deal is a testament to the tireless diplomacy and determination of many dedicated individuals across the United States government to bring Americans home,” Mr. Biden said on Wednesday on X, the platform formerly called Twitter. “Now, it’s important that all aspects are fully implemented.”

This account is based on senior Biden administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid disrupting the channels of communication.

The effort to free the hostages extends back to the hours following the terrorist attack of Oct. 7, when Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people and captured the other 240.

Shortly after the attack, the government of Qatar, a small Gulf emirate that hosts some Hamas leaders but maintains close relations with the United States, approached the White House with information about the hostages and suggested the possibility of a deal to win their release. The Qataris asked that a small group of U.S. officials work secretly with them and the Israelis.

Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser, directed Brett McGurk, the White House Middle East coordinator, and Joshua Geltzer, then the deputy homeland security adviser who has since become the top lawyer for the National Security Council, to take the lead. To preserve secrecy, other agencies were kept in the dark about the initiative.

Mr. McGurk, who has wide contacts in the region, held early morning phone calls each day with the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, and then briefed Mr. Sullivan, who kept Mr. Biden informed. Mr. Sullivan stayed in touch with Ron Dermer and Tzachi Hanegbi, two of Mr. Netanyahu’s closest advisers."
72,72,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hamas-hospital.html,"The Israeli military said early Wednesday that its troops were carrying out “a precise and targeted operation” at Gaza’s largest hospital, a complex of buildings where thousands of Palestinian refugees had taken shelter, as part of the campaign “to defeat Hamas and rescue our hostages.”

The statement came a day after Israel, facing an international outcry over the increasingly grim conditions at besieged hospitals in the Gaza Strip, sought to bolster its case for further military action by releasing a video of what it said were weapons inside a children’s hospital in Gaza and accounts of sexual violence and other atrocities committed by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attacks.

A spokesman for Gaza’s Ministry of Health told Al Aqsa TV just before the raid that the Israeli military had warned that an operation at the main hospital complex in Gaza City, Al-Shifa, was imminent.

The Israel Defense Forces also posted a statement about its operation on social media on Wednesday. But it remained unclear how many troops were involved in the assault. In the statement, the Israeli military said that the aim of the raid was not to harm civilians, and the force that went into the hospital included medical teams and Arabic speakers.

“Israel is at war with Hamas, not with the civilians in Gaza,” the announcement said. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, spokesman for the Israeli military, said on social media that the military would transfer incubators, medical equipment and baby food to the hospital. He claimed that, before the raid, Israel had tried evacuate the hospital’s patients and the people who had taken shelter there, creating a safe route for them to leave.

The New York Times was unable to reach the hospital director or the spokesman for the Gaza Health Ministry to ask about Israel’s offer, the details of which remained unclear.

In a statement, Hamas said it was holding the Israeli army and President Biden “fully responsible” for the raid. It said the White House had given Israel “a green light” for the raid on Tuesday when a spokesman said American intelligence agencies supported Israel’s conclusion that Hamas uses hospitals for military purposes.

The White House did not immediately respond to Hamas’s statement.

Israel asserts that Hamas has dug a network of tunnels beneath Gaza’s hospitals, using the patients and workers inside them as human shields for its command centers and safe houses. Hamas and hospital officials have denied the accusations.

The White House on Tuesday supported Israel’s description of Hamas’s use of hospitals, though it declined to provide specific details. “We have information that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad use some hospitals in the Gaza Strip, including Al-Shifa, and tunnels underneath them to conceal and to support their military operations and to hold hostages,” the spokesman for the National Security Council, John F. Kirby, told reporters.

“We do not support striking a hospital from the air,” he added. “And we do not want to see a firefight in a hospital where innocent people, helpless people, sick people are simply trying to get the medical care that they deserve.”

To convince skeptics of its claim, Israel released videos on Monday and Tuesday from inside Gaza’s main children’s hospital showing what it said were weapons and explosives found there, and a room where, the military said, hostages had been kept.

“This is not the last hospital like this in Gaza, and the world should know that,” said Admiral Hagari. “It’s a crime.”

Israel released the videos after weeks in which protesters, for and against the military campaign, have demonstrated around the world and as the United Nations, aid groups and many countries have criticized Israel, called for a cease-fire and warned of calamity at the hospitals. In recent days, Mr. Biden has also urged Israel to use restraint around medical centers, saying, “Hospitals must be protected.”"
73,73,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/briefing/israel-gaza-hamas-strategy.html,"The invasion seemed imminent. In the hours after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Benjamin Netanyahu appeared ready to send his troops storming into Gaza. Instead, he chose a different strategy.

Israel’s initial ground invasion was slow and secretive, more of a crawl than a sprint. Gaza is tiny, about the size of Las Vegas. But Israel took days to cross the border, surround Gaza City and move in — a strategy that the country’s defense minister called “tightening the noose.” Even that fight has been halting, and White House officials said yesterday that Israel had agreed to allow daily four-hour pauses so civilians could evacuate. (Read what we know about the battle for Gaza City so far.)

Israel has slowed down to develop a plan that could accomplish two difficult — and competing — goals.

First, it wants to eliminate Hamas. The Israeli government sees the group as an intolerable threat on its border after the Oct. 7 attack, which officials say killed roughly 1,400 people. Hamas is committed to Israel’s destruction; one of its leaders recently promised to keep attacking until Israel was destroyed."
75,75,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-return-home.html,"When the cease-fire in Gaza took effect early Friday morning, Palestinians across the Gaza Strip prepared to go back to the homes they fled to see if they were still intact, to check on relatives left behind and in some cases, to finally bury their dead.

The skies above the besieged territory were free of Israeli warplanes for the first day in seven weeks, a brief respite from what has amounted to one of the most intense bombardments of the 21st century. But as some tried to return home to northern Gaza from parts farther south on foot, Israeli forces on the ground opened fire on them, according to witnesses, an Egyptian official and some of those injured.

The Israeli military would not answer questions about whether its forces shot and killed Palestinians trying to go back to their homes. But it said its forces were “stationed along the designated operational lines of the pause” in accordance with the agreement.

Ahead of the cease-fire, Israel had warned Gazans that it would prohibit them from trying to move from southern Gaza to the north during the cessation in hostilities.

For Gazans, not being allowed to return home even temporarily during a pause in the fighting fed their fears that Israel plans to displace them permanently, as happened in 1948 during the war surrounding Israel’s creation.

“Displacement of parts of Gaza’s civilian population is permitted only if required for the civilians’ security or imperative military reasons,” said Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch. “The civilian population needs to be able to return as soon as possible — permanent displacement is a war crime.”

Israeli forces invaded Gaza weeks ago and ordered residents of northern Gaza to move to the south of the small territory. The Israeli military now occupies much of the northern half of the strip, and some 1.7 million of Gaza’s 2.3 million Palestinian residents have been forced to flee their homes. The displaced are sheltering in schools, mosques, hospitals or with family and friends.

On Friday morning, Kareem al-Nasir, 30, joined thousands of other Palestinians trying to return from central Gaza to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip. But as they tried to make their way along a road on foot, he said, Israeli forces nearby opened fire on them. Mr. al-Nasir said he was shot in the leg and is now unable to walk.

An Egyptian official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, described the same scene, saying an Israeli tank fired at a group of Palestinians at an Israeli checkpoint south of Gaza City on Friday morning and killed two people.

“They said there is a cease-fire. What cease-fire?” said Mr. al-Nasir, back at the school in Deir al-Balah, a city in central Gaza, where he and his family have been seeking shelter since they fled their home in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza. “When we tried to pass, they shot at us and injured and killed us,” he added.

“People wanted to return to their homes,” Mr. al-Nasir said. “We wanted to go see our relatives, see the martyrs, see our homes.”

Video posted by local journalists in Gaza showed hundreds of Palestinians carrying bags and bedding items and walking along roads in the southern city of Khan Younis heading to homes in other parts of southern Gaza, at least temporarily.

Some were still trying to decide if they could make the trek safely.

Nayrouz Qarmout, a Palestinian author from Gaza City in the north, said she fled with her family to southern Gaza weeks ago. She said they had been trying to find out whether they could return.

“But as far as we understand, entering the area is prohibited,” she said.

Even those who know their homes have been destroyed by Israeli airstrikes want to return to see what they can find or salvage from the rubble, she said.

“People are attempting to see what remains of their homes or relatives,” Ms. Qarmout said. “They don’t know anything about what has happened to relatives after they lost all contact with them.”

Communication in Gaza has been difficult since the early days of the war after Israel bombed a telecommunications tower; it has occasionally been plunged into near-total phone and internet blackouts, either because of Israeli disruptions or a lack of fuel.

The cease-fire deal calls for more aid to be allowed into Gaza. Besides its devastating bombardment, Israel has also imposed a near-total siege on Gaza since the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that controls the territory. That has severely restricted the deliveries of food, fuel and medicine, worsening a humanitarian crisis for the population that predated the war.

A total of 230 trucks carrying humanitarian aid, medicine and fuel were scheduled to go in on Friday through the Egyptian border, said Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing.

“No one feels safe,” said Mohammad al-Masri, a local journalist who last week fled his home in northern Gaza to Khan Younis.

“I haven’t heard anyone say they will go back home. Everyone is afraid,” he said. “Because at any movement the cease-fire could fall apart.”

Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, said Mr. Trump’s rhetoric of intolerance — as evident today as it was during his presidency — had fueled the surge of bigotry confronting Jews and Muslims after Hamas’s brutal Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the fierce Israeli response in Gaza.

And Mr. Trump’s lopsided adherence to the wishes of Israel’s right-wing government, while widely praised in Republican circles, secured only the “low-hanging fruit” of Middle Eastern diplomacy during his presidency, Mr. Christie said, denigrating one of Mr. Trump’s chief foreign policy accomplishments.

He argued that Mr. Trump’s lack of “intellectual curiosity” and foreign policy ambition had led his administration to give up the pursuit of a more elusive peace between Israelis and Palestinians.

Mr. Christie delivered a scathing assessment of Mr. Trump’s Middle East policy in an interview as he traveled to Israel on Sunday for what proved an emotional one-day visit in which he toured a kibbutz, Kfar Azza, near Gaza, where 58 residents were butchered by Hamas terrorists last month. Mr. Christie watched raw footage of the attacks at a military base near Tel Aviv, commiserated with survivors and families in a hospital and conferred with Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, in Jerusalem."
77,77,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/us/politics/democratic-aides-congress-israel-hamas.html,"They say they have struggled to reconcile their personal convictions with their professional obligations, which by definition require that they keep their opinions to themselves and zealously advocate the position of the member of Congress who employs them. They have voiced their dissenting opinions in internal meetings and grappled with what to say on calls with constituents.

And many have concluded that they have no choice but to speak out — albeit most without using their names — in a remarkably open break from the cardinal Capitol Hill rule that holds that aides should stay in the background and never publicly contradict the boss.

“For a lot of people, this is a real red line,” said Jeremy Slevin, a senior adviser to Representative Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat who is among the few members of Congress in her party to have called for a cease-fire. “It’s so horrific what’s happening, and it’s so elemental to be able to oppose the bombing of a refugee camp, for example. And it feels like the conversation up here on Capitol Hill, it’s totally divorced from reality — from the reality on the ground in Israel and Gaza, but also from the reality of the views of their own constituents and staffers.”

Most lawmakers in both political parties are staunchly pro-Israel. There is typically little tolerance on Capitol Hill for harsh criticism of the Jewish state, which some members of Congress — particularly conservative Republicans — almost reflexively brand as antisemitic.

Some Democratic congressional aides have been outspoken on the record about their defense of Israel, in contrast with their co-workers who are challenging their bosses and who have generally felt compelled to stay publicly anonymous.

Adam Jentleson, the chief of staff for Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, recently wrote on X: “hamas just *broke a ceasefire* to slaughter innocents. some think hamas will now magically abide by a ceasefire. some of us think this is unrealistic & offers up more innocents for slaughter.”

Mr. Fetterman, a progressive Democrat, has vocally defended Israel and supported humanitarian pauses, but not a cease-fire.

In an email to staff members in late October, Mr. Jentleson reminded aides that while they were permitted to sign open letters anonymously, social media posts or comments that contradicted the senator’s positions were “prohibited.”

“You cannot use your status as a current Fetterman staffer to undermine John’s positions or otherwise make a public statement that is inconsistent with John’s views,” Mr. Jentleson wrote, adding, “As the saying goes, our names are not on the door.”

Aides typically play a significant behind-the-scenes role in advising and guiding lawmakers’ policy positions. But the large public displays of disagreement, including last week’s walkout at the Capitol and a wave of open letters to lawmakers, reflect a profound generational divide among Democrats about how far to go in criticizing Israel’s military campaign.

“I can’t think of a similar or comparable effort by staff,” said Mr. Slevin, who has worked in various jobs on Capitol Hill for the better part of a decade. “It’s unlike anything we’ve ever seen.”

In the last few weeks, hundreds of staff members have signed on to letters calling on members of Congress to endorse a cease-fire. Dozens have appeared at pro-Palestinian demonstrations, including one steps from the White House where some hoisted signs that read, “Congress, your staff demands a cease-fire.”

“The voices of members of Congress hold immense power — we have seen it firsthand,” read one such open letter, which was led by Jewish and Muslim aides and signed by more than 550 staff members as of Nov. 9. “We now ask them to use that power to protect civilians in imminent danger.”

The signers accused lawmakers of ignoring the plight of Palestinian civilians killed in Israel’s military campaign while focusing intently on the Israeli civilians killed and taken hostage in Hamas’s attack on Oct. 7. The health ministry in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, estimates that 11,000 civilians have been killed there over the last month.

“We have appreciated seeing nearly every member of Congress express quick and unequivocal solidarity with the Israeli people,” the letter said, “but we are profoundly disturbed that such shows of humanity have barely been extended to the Palestinian people.”"

She was weak and easily fatigued, and a buildup of painful scar tissue on her chest caused tightness, limiting her mobility.

The militants kidnapped Ms. Engelbert, 51, and her entire family, including her husband, Ronen Engel, 54, and their daughters, 18-year-old Mika and 11-year-old Yuval, snatching them from the safe room inside their home on the Nir Oz kibbutz and taking them to the Gaza Strip, where they have been held for over 40 days.

“The last I heard from my sister was on that black sabbath at 9:30 in the morning, and she spoke very quietly, and she said, ‘They’re inside the house,’” Ms. Engelbert’s brother Diego Engelbert said in an interview.

He has not received any information about his sister’s condition, and she has not been visited by the International Red Cross, he said.

“We don’t know if she’s getting any medical treatment, if anyone is taking care of her, if she is getting any pain relief or any of the medication she needs to keep the cancer from coming back,” Mr. Engelbert said.Early Wednesday morning, the family members of the hostages were given the best news they had received in the more than six weeks since their loved ones were seized.

The Israeli government and Hamas announced that they would uphold a brief cease-fire in Gaza to allow for the release of at least 50 hostages. But the deal will still leave hostages behind. Ms. Engelbert is one of about 240 who were abducted from Israel, many of whom need urgent medical attention.

The Israeli government said that those who would be returned home are “women and children,” but their freedom, according to an Israeli official, would not come before Thursday at the earliest to allow time for Israeli judges to review potential legal challenges to the agreement, which calls for the release of 150 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.

The hostages in Gaza range in age from infants to octogenarians, and include a Thai foreign worker who was nine months pregnant on Oct. 7 and may have given birth in captivity. There are many kibbutz members in their mid-80s who were taking medications for chronic conditions like high blood pressure, and younger adults who have both psychiatric conditions and medical conditions that can be fatal if left untreated.

And then there were those who sustained potentially life-threatening injuries in the raid itself, which killed an estimated 1,200 people, most of them civilians."
79,79,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire.html,"A four-day cease-fire between Israel and Hamas — the first extended break in almost seven weeks of war — will most likely not begin until Friday at the earliest, Israeli officials said on Wednesday night, as negotiators hammered out details of an agreement between Israel and Hamas that would pause the fighting to allow the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners.

The timing for the releases, which may also not begin until Friday, was released in a statement issued by the National Security Council through the Israeli prime minister’s office, and appeared to rule out the possibility that hostages could be freed on Thursday, as many of their families had hoped.

The timing on the cease-fire was disclosed by an Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the highly sensitive issue.

The new information underscored the fluidity of the negotiations between Israel and Hamas, which are being mediated by Qatar. Earlier Wednesday, Moussa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official, told Al Jazeera from Qatar that his group had agreed to a temporary cease-fire starting at 10 a.m. local time on Thursday, and an Israeli official had set out the same timing.

The two sides announced Wednesday morning — Tuesday evening in the United States — that they had agreed to the exchange and a pause in fighting, but spent much of the day working out tricky details about timing and methods. In an atmosphere of deep mutual mistrust, with a history of collapsed truces and without an intermediary attempting to keep peace on the ground, Palestinians and Israelis alike worried that the deal might yet fall through.

The deal calls for the release of at least 150 Palestinian women and teenagers jailed by Israel in exchange for at least 50 women and minors taken hostage during the Hamas assault in Israel on Oct. 7. Israel said its warplanes would not fly over southern Gaza for the duration of the cease-fire, and would not fly over the northern part of the territory for six hours each day.

But as if to highlight that there was no lull in the war yet, the Israeli military said on Wednesday that it “continued to fight in the Gaza Strip,” while Hamas said it had agreed to a truce, but “our hands will remain on the trigger.”"

But since the Hamas-led terror attack on Oct. 7 and the war in Gaza, most Palestinians have been banned from Israel and many fearful Thais have returned home, leaving growers to scramble for labor.

“My workers are gone because of the war; I’m panicking,“ said Gabi Swissa, 61, from his farm outside Kadima in central Israel. For decades, he has counted on Palestinians and Thais to plant, harvest and pack strawberries.

Mr. Swissa, a former soldier from an elite combat unit who suffers from PTSD, was in tears. Volunteers he had expected to help on his farm one day last week had not shown up.

The vision of a food-secure homeland has for decades driven Israel’s economic policies and shaped its self-image as a nation that made the desert bloom. But now, as the country is focused on fighting a war and rescuing hostages held captive by Hamas, it is also struggling to run the farms that underpin its identity.

“Israeli agriculture is in the biggest crisis since the establishment of the state in 1948,” said Yuval Lipkin, deputy executive director of the Ministry of Agriculture.

Since the outset of the war, he said, farms are lacking at least 15,000 workers."
81,81,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/19/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-back-channel-gershon-hamad.html,"It was an early flash of common ground between two men from markedly different backgrounds.

Mr. Baskin was born in 1956 to a Jewish family in New York. He studied Middle Eastern politics and history at New York University before emigrating to Israel in 1978.

Mr. Hamad was born in 1964 in southern Gaza and had no meaningful contact with Israelis as a child, even after Israel captured Gaza during the Arab-Israeli war of 1967.

Mr. Hamad trained as a vet in Sudan before joining Hamas in 1987, the year the group was founded, according to an interview with Mr. Hamad that Mr. Baskin published in his book, “The Negotiator.” In 1989, Mr. Hamad was arrested for his Hamas activism and spent five years in an Israeli prison.

As both men matured, they each developed an aptitude for mediation.

After arriving in Israel, Mr. Baskin worked as a community organizer in an Arab village. Then he began a career fostering relations between Arabs and Jews, running a research group that promoted solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and sometimes acting as a formal mediator.

While in prison, Mr. Hamad got to know Israelis for the first time. He learned Hebrew and English, and became a spokesman for inmates in their dealings with the prison authorities.

After his release, Mr. Hamad wrote for and edited several Hamas-run newspapers, earning a reputation as a moderate who encouraged Palestinian introspection and occasionally criticized Palestinian violence.

“I’m not interested in discussing the ugliness and brutality of the occupation, because it is not a secret,” Mr. Hamad wrote in an opinion article in 2006. “Instead, I prefer self-criticism and self-evaluation. We’re used to blaming our mistakes on others.”

The lives of Mr. Hamad and Mr. Baskin became entwined with the fate of Mr. Shalit, the captured Israeli soldier.

After their first phone call in July 2006, Mr. Hamad and Mr. Baskin began to phone and text each other regularly, sometimes several times a day.

Mr. Baskin wanted to save Mr. Shalit’s life. As a Hamas loyalist, Mr. Hamad wanted to exchange Mr. Shalit for hundreds of Palestinians jailed by Israel.

Though Mr. Hamad never said so publicly, Mr. Baskin also believed that Mr. Hamad privately hoped to help Mr. Shalit, a 19-year-old conscript. More generally, Mr. Baskin believed that Mr. Hamad secretly sought a peace deal with Israel.

“I am quite sure that if Ghazi were a much more senior leader in Hamas, he would move toward eventually recognizing Israel and peace,” Mr. Baskin wrote in his book in 2013.

Whether or not Mr. Baskin correctly understood Mr. Hamad’s motivations, the two men quickly established an unlikely rapport, one that was strengthened through years of intense contact but tested by the frequent violence between their two peoples.

“Gershon, u r good friend,” Mr. Hamad said during another round of violence, in a text that Mr. Baskin printed in his book. “But I’m very sad and upset & sometimes feeling have no words to say.”

Years passed. Hamas took full control of Gaza in 2007, ousting another Palestinian faction. Israel and Egypt placed the enclave under a blockade."
82,82,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/19/world/middleeast/gaza-infants-evacuation-israel.html,"Four days after it was seized by Israeli troops, the Gaza Strip’s largest hospital has become a “death zone,” the World Health Organization said, as 31 premature babies in extremely precarious health there were evacuated on Sunday.

Emergency medical workers from the Palestine Red Crescent Society and the W.H.O., a United Nations agency, transported the babies by ambulance from the hospital, Al-Shifa in Gaza City, to the neonatal intensive care unit of a hospital in the city of Rafah, about 25 miles away in southern Gaza.

Officials in Gaza and Egypt have said the babies will then be brought to Egypt for treatment, though the timing was unclear.

The infants have captured global attention, coming to symbolize what Israel’s critics call the recklessness of its assault, and the heavy toll that has fallen on the most vulnerable since the military began pounding Gaza. The military campaign began after the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7 that, the Israelis say, killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel.

The assailants also seized more than 200 others as hostages, the Israelis say, and took them back to Gaza. Negotiations aimed at releasing at least some of the hostages and observing a cease-fire were still underway Sunday night.

Since war began, more than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including more than 4,000 children, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory.

The storming of Al-Shifa last week was a critical moment for Israel as it sought to expose what it called a Hamas military hub there amid searing international criticism over the Israeli decision to raid a medical center. On Sunday, the Israeli military released new videos that it said supported its contention that Hamas had been using the hospital to shelter fighters and store weapons, and to plan attacks.



Both the Palestinian armed group and Al-Shifa officials have denied that Hamas had an underground command center there."
83,83,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/us/politics/chris-christie-israel.html,"Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey who is running for president, will go to Israel on Sunday, pressing what he sees as his foreign policy advantage in the race and challenging the other Republicans seeking the White House nomination to join him.

The trip will be his second to a war zone since opening his presidential bid. In August, he paid a surprise visit to Ukraine and met with that country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The details of his itinerary remain under wraps for security purposes, but his campaign said he would be conferring with Israeli officials, visiting a hospital treating survivors of the Oct. 7 massacre by Hamas, and touring the region around Gaza to meet with families still bereft over the attack last month that claimed the lives of around 1,400 in Israel, most of them civilians.

“If I’m going to continue to be a strong advocate for doing everything we need to do to defend Israel, I got to see it for myself,” he told voters in New Hampshire Thursday. “And if you really want to lead, you need to go over and show the people of Israel that one person running for president of the United States cares enough to get on an airplane and get over there and do what needs to be done to find out how we fix this problem.”

Another person in the race has already done that — the incumbent, President Biden. But the Republican front-runner, former President Donald J. Trump, has not."
84,84,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/world/middleeast/yehudit-weiss-hamas-hostage-israel.html,"Israeli soldiers have recovered the bodies of two hostages kidnapped during the Hamas-led attack on Israel last month from buildings near the Al-Shifa Hospital complex in Gaza City, the Israeli military has said.

The body of Yehudit Weiss, 65, a resident of Be’eri, a kibbutz near the border with Gaza, was found Thursday by troops who in recent days have taken control of much of the hospital, the largest in the Gaza Strip, according to the Israeli military. On Friday, the military said soldiers recovered the body of a second hostage, Corp. Noa Marciano, 19, in a building next to Al-Shifa hospital.

The Israeli authorities say that Hamas and other Palestinian groups took roughly 240 people hostage during the surprise attack on Oct. 7 that left about 1,200 dead in Israel. The ongoing hostage crisis — which involves dozens of dual nationals — has stunned the country and complicated Israel’s hopes of toppling Hamas in Gaza.

Israeli officials say the hospital complex hosts major Hamas facilities, some in underground bunkers, a claim that Hamas and hospital officials reject. The military has said the presence of the hostages’ bodies near the hospital is indicative that Hamas used the complex.

In its statement on Thursday, the military did not reveal how Ms. Weiss had died. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, told reporters that soldiers searching within and beneath the hospital complex had found weapons belonging to her captors near her remains.

“Yehudit was killed by terrorists in the Gaza Strip, and we didn’t manage to reach her in time,” he said."
85,85,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/opinion/israel-gaza-facts.html,"With the bilateral slaughter in the Middle East unleashing poisons that are worsening hatred worldwide, let me outline what I see as three myths inflaming the debate:

The first myth is that in the conflict in the Middle East there is right on one side and wrong on the other (even if people disagree about which is which).

Life isn’t that neat. The tragedy of the Middle East is that this is a clash of right versus right. That does not excuse Hamas’s massacre and savagery or Israel’s leveling of entire neighborhoods in Gaza, but underlying the conflict are certain legitimate aspirations that deserve to be fulfilled.

Israelis deserve their country, forged by refugees in the shadow of the Holocaust, and they have built a high-tech economy that largely empowers women and respects gay people, while giving its Palestinian citizens more rights than most Arab nations give their citizens. Israel’s courts, media freedom and civil society are models for the region, and there is something of a double standard: Critics pounce on Israeli abuses while often ignoring prolonged brutality against Muslims from Yemen to Syria, Western Sahara to Xinjiang.

Likewise, Palestinians deserve a country, freedom and dignity — and they shouldn’t be subjected to collective punishment. We’ve reached a searing milestone: In just five weeks of war, half of 1 percent of Gaza’s population has been killed. To put it in perspective, that’s more than the share of the American population that was killed in all of World War II — over the course of four years.

A great majority of those killed have been women and children, according to Gaza’s Hamas-controlled Health Ministry, and one gauge of the ferocity and indiscriminate nature of some airstrikes is that more than 100 United Nations staffers have been killed, which the U.N. says is more than in any conflict since its founding. Perhaps that’s because, as an Israeli military spokesman put it early in the conflict, “the emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy.”

“We are normal people, trying to live,” an engineer in Gaza told me by phone. He despises Hamas and would like to see it removed from power, but he says that Hamas fighters are safe in tunnels while he and his children are the ones most at risk: “We’re the civilians paying the price.”

Whichever side you are more inclined toward, remember that the other includes desperate human beings merely hoping that their children can live freely and thrive in their own nation.

The second myth is that Palestinians can be put off indefinitely, strung along by Israel, the United States and other countries. That was Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s strategy, his way of avoiding a Palestinian state, and it worked for a time — the way a pressure cooker works, until it explodes.

It’s difficult to know the counterfactual, whether a Palestinian state would have been better for Israeli security. But Palestinian statelessness in retrospect has not made Israel safe, and risks may increase if the Palestinian Authority collapses from corruption, ineffectiveness and lack of legitimacy.

Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, said that one of the Hamas attackers on Oct. 7 was carrying instructions for releasing chemical weapons, and that’s a reminder of the risk that terrorism experts have worried about for years of extremist groups turning to biological and chemical agents.

Israel has a right to feel anxious in any case, but I suspect that the best way to ensure its security may be not to defer Palestinian aspirations but to honor them with a two-state solution. This is not just a concession to Arabs but a pragmatic acknowledgment of Israel’s own interests — and the world’s.

The third myth is found on both sides of the conflict and is approximately: It’s too bad we have to engage in this bloodshed, but the people on the other side understand only violence.

I hear that from friends who support the war in Gaza and regard me as well-meaning but misguided, as a naif who fails to comprehend the sad reality that the only way to keep Israel safe is to pulverize Gaza and uproot Hamas at whatever human cost.

Hamas indeed understands only violence, and it has been brutal to Israelis and Palestinians alike — but Hamas and Palestinians are not the same, just as violent settlers in the West Bank do not represent all Israelis. I’m all for surgical strikes against Hamas and I would be delighted if Israel managed to end extremism in Gaza. But so far, I’m afraid that the ferocity and lack of precision in Israel’s attack have fulfilled Hamas’s goal of escalating the Palestinian issue and changing the Middle East dynamic (and Hamas is indifferent to Palestinian casualties).

In that sense, Hamas may be winning.

Five weeks into this war, I don’t see evidence that Israel’s military has degraded Hamas in a significant way, but it has killed vast numbers of civilians, put the Palestinian struggle on top of the global agenda, dissipated the initial torrent of sympathy for Israel, prompted people around the globe to march for Palestine, distracted attention from kidnapped Israelis and ruptured any possibility soon of Israel’s normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia.

My friend Roy Grow, an international relations specialist at Carleton College who died in 2013, used to say that a crucial goal of terror organizations was getting the adversary to overreact. He compared this to jujitsu, with terrorist organizations using their opponents’ weight against them — and that is what Hamas has done.

Each side has dehumanized the other, but people are complex and neither side is monolithic — and remember that wars are not about populations but about people. These are people like Mohammed Alshannat, a doctoral student in Gaza, who has been sending desperate messages to friends who shared them with me; he agreed to allow me to publish them as a glimpse into Gazan life.

“There was heavy bombing in our area,” he wrote in English in one message. “We run for our lives and I lost two of my children in the dark. Me and my wife stayed all night searching for them amidst hundreds of airstrikes. We miraculously survived an airstrike and found them fainted in the morning. Please pray for us. The situation is beyond description.”

“I see death a hundred times a day,” he wrote another time. “We defecate in the open and my children defecate on themselves and there is no water to clean them.”

If he survives the war, what will we Americans say to him and his children? How will we explain that we supplied bombs for this war, that we were complicit in his family’s terror and degradation?

If there is a path forward toward peace — whether in two states or one state — it will begin with all of us moving beyond stereotypes. Israelis are not the same as Netanyahu, and Palestinians are not the same as Hamas.

Seeking humanity in each side means demanding the release of Israeli hostages and calling out the dehumanization that leads people to pull down posters for kidnapped Israelis. It also means renouncing what Netanyahu called “mighty vengeance” that transforms entire neighborhoods of Gaza into rubble, with bodies buried underneath.

I’m exasperated by people whose hearts bleed for only one side, or who say about the toll on the other: “It’s tragic, but ….” No “buts.” Unless you believe in human rights for Jews and for Palestinians, you don’t actually believe in human rights.

If you weep only for Israeli children, or only for Palestinian children, you have a problem that goes beyond your tear ducts. Children on both sides have been slaughtered quite recklessly, and fixing this crisis starts with acknowledging a principle so basic that it shouldn’t need mentioning: All children’s lives have equal value, and good people come in all nationalities."
86,86,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-rantisi-hospital-video.html,"Israel is pressing its case that Hamas is using hospitals as cover, releasing a pair of videos from inside Gaza’s main children’s hospital that showed weapons and explosives purportedly found in the medical center, and a room where the military said hostages were kept.

While the Health Ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, on Tuesday disputed nearly every assertion made in the initial Israeli video, it acknowledged that the footage was taken from inside Al-Rantisi Specialized Hospital for Children in northern Gaza. The remaining patients and staff are believed to have left the hospital over the weekend after it was surrounded by Israeli forces.

U.S. intelligence supports the Israeli allegation of Hamas operating within and beneath hospitals, a National Security Council spokesman said on Tuesday.

Israeli troops entered shortly thereafter, and took videos that the military released on Monday and Tuesday as part of a campaign to persuade skeptics that Hamas had turned hospitals into safe houses and command centers and has built tunnels underneath them."
87,87,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/world/middleeast/al-shifa-evacuation-israel-hamas.html,"“Medical personnel will remain in the hospital to support patients who are unable to evacuate,” the Israeli military said in a statement, adding that it had provided “additional food, water and humanitarian assistance” to Al-Shifa overnight.

It was not immediately clear how many patients, staff members or Israeli soldiers remained in the complex. Munir al-Bursh, an official with the Gazan Health Ministry, said in a statement that at least 120 patients and five doctors were inside.

Some of those who have left hospitals in the north in recent weeks have ended up at the European Gaza Hospital in Khan Younis, in the south, where families have been sleeping in crowded corridors and workers have been scrambling to treat patients amid a shortage of beds, according to Dr. Saleh Al-Hamase, the hospital’s head of nursing.

Dozens of wounded people went to the hospital after a nearly 16-mile journey from Al-Shifa last week, many on foot and some in wheelchairs, Dr. Al-Hamase said. Only the most severe cases were sent in ambulances, he said.

The hospital was preparing on Saturday to receive 200 more patients from Al-Shifa, Dr. Al-Hamase said.

“We are days away from running out of fuel and collapsing,” he said. “The scenes at the hospital are tragic, and the bombardment around us is continuous.”

Israeli soldiers seized the Al-Shifa hospital complex on Wednesday, saying that it hosted an underground Hamas command center. Both the Palestinian armed group and Al-Shifa officials have denied the accusation.

Israeli troops say they have found weapons caches in the complex and, near the hospital, the bodies of two Israeli hostages captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel.

On Thursday, the Israeli military escorted journalists from The New York Times to Al-Shifa to see a stone-and-concrete shaft with a staircase descending into the earth — evidence, the military said, of a Hamas presence there. But the army has yet to provide conclusive proof of a subterranean military base.

The departures from Al-Shifa came as the Israeli military, having claimed control of northern Gaza, signaled plans to expand its offensive against Hamas into the south, where hundreds of thousands of civilians have fled in recent weeks in the hopes of escaping pounding airstrikes and widespread destruction.

Even as Israel continued to tell civilians to flee south for their own safety, the Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said late Friday that its troops would continue operations “in every place that Hamas is, and it is in the south of the strip.”

His statement appeared to telegraph a new phase in the war, three weeks into Israel’s ground invasion."
88,88,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/opinion/us-military-aid-war-israel.html,"Working on the ground with the authority, I saw how the major focus of U.S. efforts was to prove to the Israel Defense Forces that their Palestinian counterparts could be trusted to take on the mission of securing Israel. Palestinian intelligence officials would be provided with target information by Israel, and Palestinian forces would be expected to take on missions previously conducted by the Israel Defense Forces to detain those targets. This effort not only undermined Palestinian support for the authority but also failed to convince the Israelis, who saw any Palestinian courts’ (correct) refusal to hold Palestinian detainees without due process as proof of a revolving door in the system.

Even worse, in 2008 and ’09, when Israel’s Operation Cast Lead, which resulted in over 1,300 Palestinian deaths in Gaza, sparked protests in the West Bank, it was the Palestinian Authority Security Forces that physically stood between demonstrators and the Israel Defense Forces. From my balcony in Ramallah, I saw this as a proof of success and reported as much to Washington at the time. In hindsight, it was perhaps the death knell for the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority in the eyes of its people. Regardless, it still does not seem that the authority has earned Israel’s trust; last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unequivocally ruled out the idea of allowing the authority to control Gaza after the war.

If the United States is to continue to employ military and security assistance as a tool of its engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (and there are good arguments why it should not), it must change its approach significantly. One way to do this would be simply by applying the laws and policies that it applies to every other country in the world: There is no point in having leverage that could pressure Israel to cease actions that undermine peace if we refuse to even consider using it. The United States could also start conditioning its military assistance to Israel (as it does for many other recipients) on certain verifiable political conditions being met. In Israel’s case, these may include a halt to or dismantling of settlement infrastructure in the West Bank.

Another thing the U.S. might do is consider reframing its security assistance on the Palestinian side to reinforce, rather than undermine, the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority — a task even more vital and even more difficult in the current context, in which the authority is seen as complicit with the occupation, and Hamas is increasingly seen as the standard-bearer of Palestinian resistance. Doing so would require structuring assistance in a way that enables Palestinian society control over its own security forces. It would also require the recognition of Palestinian statehood. But all this could be fully achieved only with the agreement of the Israelis or at least a willingness on their part to decenter their security demands, which would be unlikely without the United States leveraging its military assistance to Israel.

I resigned from my job because I do not believe that U.S. arms should be provided in a situation if we know they are more likely than not — in the words of the Biden administration’s own guiding policy — to lead to or to aggravate the risk of human rights violations, including widespread civilian harm and death."
89,89,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/us/politics/hamas-hospitals-gaza-israel.html,"The United States has intelligence that shows that Hamas has been using hospitals in Gaza, including Al-Shifa, as command centers and ammunitions depots, a spokesman for the National Security Council said on Tuesday.

John F. Kirby, the spokesman, said that the intelligence, gathered from American-generated sources, supported Israel’s allegation that Hamas has been operating out of hospitals, which Mr. Kirby said amounted to a war crime.

Mr. Kirby declined to provide details about the U.S. intelligence, but he made clear that it goes beyond the information collected by the Israeli intelligence service. “It comes from a variety of intelligence methods — of our own, of our own,” he said, adding that the classification of the intelligence had been downgraded so that it could be shared publicly.

“I can confirm for you that we have information that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad use some hospitals in the Gaza Strip, including Al-Shifa, and tunnels underneath them, to conceal and to support their military operations and to hold hostages,” Mr. Kirby told reporters on Air Force One as President Biden headed to San Francisco for a summit with Asia-Pacific leaders.

“Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad — J.I.D. — members operate a command and control node from Al-Shifa in Gaza City,” he added. “They have stored weapons there, and they’re prepared to respond to an Israeli military operation against that facility.”

The revelation of the U.S. intelligence comes as Israel is under harsh international criticism for attacks on and around hospitals as it conducts a war against Hamas in the wake of the armed group’s terrorist attacks on Israel on Oct. 7. Israel says more than 1,200 people were killed in the attacks and that 239 others remain hostages.

During Israel’s ensuing military campaign to eradicate Hamas, it has repeatedly said that its military seeks to avoid casualties among civilians, including patients and doctors at hospitals. But they have insisted that Hamas uses such people as human shields.

Mr. Kirby said that the United States does not support attacks from the air on hospitals, despite what he said was the confirmed use of the facilities by Hamas.

“We do not support striking a hospital from the air,” he said. “And we do not want to see a firefight in a hospital where innocent people, helpless people, sick people are simply trying to get the medical care that they deserve, not to be caught in a crossfire. Hospitals and patients must be protected.”

He called that concern an “added burden” for Israel in its military campaign against Hamas.

Palestinian officials and doctors at Al-Shifa have denied that the hospital has been used by Hamas. But Mr. Kirby said that the newly revealed U.S. intelligence supported Israel’s arguments as its military closed in on the hospital.

“We have information that confirms that Hamas is using that particular hospital for a command and control node and probably storage of equipment weapons up underneath,” he said. “That is a war crime.”"
90,90,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/arts/israel-documentary-hunter-cancel.html,"The screening of “Israelism” at Hunter had been planned since June, according to Tami Gold, a professor in the film and media department who organized the screening. The movie, made by a nearly all-Jewish team, follows two young Jews, Simone Zimmerman and Eitan (who withholds his last name). In the West Bank, where Eitan served in the military, they meet Palestinians and Israelis, encountering the realities of the more than five-decade-long occupation.

The film also features outside experts, including the philosopher Cornel West, a supporter of Palestinian rights who is now running for president; Jeremy Ben-Ami, the founder of the liberal Jewish group J Street; and Abraham H. Foxman, the former national director of the Anti-Defamation League, who connects his staunch support for Israel to his experiences as a Holocaust survivor. (In June, Foxman wrote on social media that he regretted participating, calling it “an anti-Israel and anti-American Jewish community film.”)

Daniel J. Chalfen, one of the film’s producers, said there had initially been some “pushback,” including when a screening in June was hosted by the Israel studies center at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Otherwise, there was no safety or security issue prior to Oct. 7,” he said.

After the Hamas surprise attack that day, which killed about 1,200 people, according to the Israeli government, screenings were paused for about 10 days, Chalfen said. Since then, some venues have asked to postpone, and a screening at Grinnell College in Iowa was canceled.

Hunter’s decision, Chalfen said, was the result of “a very organized campaign to shut it down.”

Kelly Anderson, the chair of the film and media department, said that on Nov. 8, she received an email from an administrator with the subject line “Just in case you thought this had died down.”

The email said that over the previous 14 hours, Hunter had received between 250 and 300 copies of an identical email calling on the college to cancel the screening.

“It’s not portraying an interesting viewpoint,” the emails said of the film. “It’s simply promoting anti-Israel sentiment. There is never a time to air this film, but especially not at a time when the A.D.L. reports that incidents of harassment, vandalism and assaults against Jews have increased by 388 percent over the same time last year.”

Last week, another email campaign emerged on Facebook, encouraging people to send a different, more harshly worded email urging Hunter to cancel the film, which was described as “antisemitic.” The film was “solely created with the goal of convincing its viewers that Israel is an apartheid state, and that the Palestinians have been victimized,” the letter claims.

On Friday, Anderson and Gold said, they were approached by the dean, Andrew Polsky, about security issues. He suggested hiring an extra security guard, but was generally supportive of going forward, they said.

But then Polsky got in touch again, saying that access would be limited to students and faculty and staff members. Anderson said she was not worried about safety, particularly once no outside audience was permitted. “Our students are so used to being in classrooms with people different from them,” she said. “I think the heat is really online, with these groups that are riled up.”

But on Tuesday morning, Anderson was told that Kirschner had decided to cancel the screening entirely. (DiMiceli said that both Polsky and Kirschner were unavailable for comment.)

In a meeting that morning, Anderson said, Kirschner reiterated her concerns about safety, and also said she found the tone of the film’s trailer “mocking.” No one in the room, including herself, had seen the full documentary, Anderson said. (DiMiceli, in an email, said that Kirschner had found the tone of one scene, featuring a Jewish day school student, “mocking.”)

On Tuesday night, even though the screening was forbidden, roughly 70 students and faculty members met to talk with the director and one of the people featured in the film.

“Everyone was extremely respectful of one another,” Anderson said. “It was a very mixed group. They were unhappy with this decision. They felt censored.”

91,91,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/world/middleeast/iraq-elizabeth-tsurkov-video.html,"An Iraqi television station posted a video Monday purporting to show a kidnapped Israeli-Russian researcher for the first time since her disappearance seven months ago, when she was seized off the streets in Baghdad.

The video claiming to be of the researcher, Elizabeth Tsurkov, a doctoral student at Princeton University, was shown on Al Rabiaa TV, a station that is associated with Shiite political parties. Later in the evening, three other broadcast outlets displayed the video, including the channel most closely associated with Kataib Hezbollah — an Iraqi Shiite militia linked to Iran and the group reported to be holding her.

Ms. Tsurkov was kidnapped in late March after having coffee in a Baghdad cafe. The first official disclosure of her capture came this summer when the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said she was being held by Kataib Hezbollah.

At the time of Mr. Netanyahu’s announcement in July, the Iraqi government said it was investigating her capture. No group has claimed responsibility for her kidnapping.

Ms. Tsurkov went to Iraq in January to do academic research. She holds both Israeli and Russian passports and entered the country using her Russian passport, according to the Iraqi government. Israel and Iraq do not have diplomatic relations; Iraq deems Israel a hostile state and has banned all contact with it.

In the video, Ms. Tsurkov, who speaks in Hebrew throughout, is shown alone, seated on a couch. She is dressed in black, her long hair is loose and she speaks softly but clearly. The video was shown with Arabic subtitles.

The New York Times was not able to authenticate the video, but its content makes clear that it was made after the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7.

In it, Ms. Tsurkov speaks directly to the families of the Israelis who are being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza and tells them — making clear that she is speaking herself as a hostage — that if they want to see their family members again, they need to stop the war.

“I ask the families of the hostages in Gaza to constantly make efforts to stop the war on Gaza, for the sake of your sons and daughters,” she said. “This war that is being stupidly run by Netanyahu through his wife, Sara, and his son, Yair, will lead to the hostages being killed. If you want your sons and daughters to return alive, the war must stop.”

In addition to the political message contained in the video, the reference to the Gaza war — which Ms. Tsurkov says she follows daily — suggests that her captors may have wanted the video to serve as proof to her family and the Israeli government that she is still alive.

The statement from Mr. Netanyahu’s office this summer said, “We hold Iraq responsible for her safety and well-being.”

Her kidnapping spotlighted a problem that Iraq’s leaders have been grappling with: Some military groups absorbed into Iraq’s security forces have stronger ties to Iran than to Iraq, and security officials say Kataib Hezbollah is the most prominent of these.

The video opens in the style of a confession, in which Ms. Tsurkov says she was working on behalf of Israeli intelligence and the C.I.A., something that her family and friends deny.

The statement from Mr. Netanyahu’s office said she was an academic who visited Iraq “at her own initiative pursuant to work on her doctorate and academic research on behalf of Princeton University.”

Ms. Tsurkov was also a fellow at the New Lines Institute for Strategy at the time of her capture. A fluent Arabic speaker, she had been researching the relationships among armed groups on both sides of the Iraqi-Syrian border. She had done her mandatory military service in the Israeli army, and it was during that time that she became more interested in the Arab world, and pursued graduate work first in Israel and then in the United States.

At the end of the video, Ms. Tsurkov speaks directly to her family, pleading with them to help win her release. “I am in a difficult spot,” she says.

“To my family, to my mother and father, Rina, Arkady, Emma, Avital, David, my friends, I call on them to work to secure my release as soon as possible so I can return to them.”

If the question is whether Israel will be able to defeat Hamas, the answer is almost certainly yes: Israeli military planners have been war-gaming an invasion of Gaza for decades and, despite the intelligence blunders of Oct. 7, have tools and tactics that can flush Hamas’s fighters out of their maze of tunnels. Nor is the Israeli public likely to be swayed by civilian casualties into supporting any kind of cease-fire in the military campaign until Hamas is defeated and the hostages are returned. Israelis spent 18 years watching Hamas turn to its military advantage every Israeli concession — including free electricity, cash transfers of Qatari funds, work permits for Gazans, thousands of truckloads of humanitarian goods. Israelis won’t get fooled again.

But while Israelis are still processing the horror from the south, the threat of war looms on every side. Around the world, too many people are showing their true colors when it comes to their feelings about Jews, and darkness in the West has made it feel colder in Israel.

A few days after my visit to Camp Iftach, I drove north to Metula, a picturesque Israeli village on a finger of land surrounded on three sides by Lebanon. Other than a handful of soldiers, it was mostly deserted; it would almost surely be captured by Hezbollah in the early hours of a full-scale conflict, which would make the Gaza front look like child’s play.

In the West Bank, nightly Israeli security raids against Hamas and allied terror cells in cities like Jenin and Nablus are largely what stand in the way between the unpopular and corrupt Palestinian Authority and a Hamas coup. Compounding the tension is a sharp uptick in settler violence, with some seeing the crisis as an “opportunity to vent their spleen with M-16s,” as an Israeli reporter put it to me. Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right finance minister, has even suggested effectively banning the Palestinian olive harvest, ostensibly for security reasons. “That would be like banning the Super Bowl,” the reporter observed. It would guarantee an explosion.

And then there’s the wider world. Vladimir Putin, whom Netanyahu did so much to court over more than a decade, has all but openly thrown his support behind Hamas, in part because of Russia’s deepening alliance with Hamas’s patrons in Iran. In China, state-run and social media have veered sharply into open antisemitism. In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, with whom Israel had been engaged in a careful rapprochement, has reverted to Islamist form. “Hamas is not a terrorist organization,” he told members of his parliamentary group late last month, but a “mujahedeen liberation group struggling to protect its people and lands.”

Just as frightening to many Israelis I spoke with was the turn against Israel in the West, a turn that, increasingly, is nakedly pro-Hamas and antisemitic. It’s visible in more than just the attempted firebombing of a synagogue in Berlin or the chants of “gas the Jews” in Sydney, Australia. It’s also in the sheer indifference among educated elites to Israeli suffering — typified by college-age students tearing down campus posters of kidnapped Israeli civilians.

“The effort on campuses and progressive circles to equate Zionism with all that is evil prepared the ground for the hardening belief that ‘the Jews had it coming,’” Einat Wilf, a Harvard graduate and former member of the Knesset for the Labor Party, told me. To many Israelis, there’s a distinct echo of what happened at German universities beginning about a century ago.

It may be that what started near Gaza will end there, too. But there’s a growing sense among Israelis, as well as many Jews in the diaspora, that what happened on Oct. 7 may be the opening act of something much larger and worse: another worldwide war against the Jews."
93,93,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/us/politics/israel-palestinian-americans-west-bank.html,"Follow live news updates on the Israel-Hamas war.

Israel is preventing Palestinian Americans from entering the country from the West Bank, an apparent violation of a recent agreement in which citizens from the United States and Israel can travel to the other nation without a visa.

The Homeland Security and State Departments, which manage the program, said American officials were trying to resolve the issue.

“U.S. government officials are working with the government of Israel to address reports of Americans facing issues in traveling to and flying out of Ben-Gurion Airport,” said Erin Heeter, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security.

The arrangement, announced in late September, before the war began, was part of a larger effort toward improving relations between the two countries. At the time, President Biden was making a push to broker a diplomatic deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia.

Under the visa waiver program, Israel would lift restrictions on Palestinian Americans and other Americans of Arab or Muslim descent, easing the way for them to travel to and from Palestinian territories.

For decades, Palestinian Americans have faced difficulties traveling to the Israeli-occupied West Bank to see family and friends or to do humanitarian work. They have been forced to first travel to Jordan, which shares a border with the territory. They typically fly in and out of the Queen Alia International Airport in Amman, the capital of Jordan, rather than entering or leaving from Tel Aviv.

American officials insisted that the agreement would change that. But shortly after Israel’s inclusion in the program was announced, Hamas carried out a deadly attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and ignited an Israeli invasion of Gaza as well as a surge of violence in the West Bank.

Israel, citing security reasons, further restricted the movements of Palestinians in the West Bank, whether they hold an American passport or not. Palestinian Americans found themselves unable to cross in or out of Israel at that border.

It was an early test to an agreement that some had doubted Israel would uphold.

“Of course, everybody got excited about this new regulation, allowing us to go through Ben-Gurion because of our citizenship,” said Fidah Mousa, a Palestinian American who lives in the West Bank.

During a pilot period over the summer, more than 100,000 U.S. citizens, including tens of thousands of Palestinian Americans, were able to travel to Israel without a visa. At the time, Ms. Mousa purchased a ticket to fly out of Tel Aviv to return to the United States in October to attend her daughter’s wedding.

“Deep down, I didn’t think it was going to last,” she said of the equal treatment.

Days after the Oct. 7 attack, Ms. Mousa said her employer, an international nongovernment organization, sent her updates about Israel’s closure of checkpoints to Palestinian Americans seeking to enter from the West Bank.

Inam Mansor, a Palestinian American lawyer who lives in the West Bank, said she had been told by an Israeli border official on Sunday that the visa privilege for Palestinian Americans was no longer available.

It was precisely the situation some feared.

“Here we are in the middle of an actual crisis — being told to go” to Amman, to fly from Queen Alia International Airport, said Maya Berry, the executive director of the Arab American Institute, an advocacy organization. “It’s yet another example of why Israel does not belong in this program.”

Civil rights groups like the Arab American Institute raised concerns about Israel’s entry into the visa waiver program. Some Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, also expressed skepticism.

“While he understands the difficult security climate in Israel, all American citizens are guaranteed reciprocity under the visa waiver program, and he has serious concerns about this development,” said Francesca Amodeo, a spokeswoman for Mr. Van Hollen.

After the Oct. 7 attacks, the Biden administration moved up the start date of the program so Israelis fleeing the war could have an easier time entering the United States.

Asked about Palestinian Americans who were unable to leave the West Bank for Israel, State Department officials said they had been trying to help them go overland to Jordan.

“To expand the departure options for U.S. citizens in the West Bank, the State Department has begun chartering overland transportation for U.S. citizens and their immediate family members from the West Bank to Jordan,” the department said.

Separately, the department arranged charter flights from Oct. 13 to 31 to ferry American passengers out of Israel, even though commercial flights were still running. Dozens of flights destined for Washington and a few European capitals left Tel Aviv mostly empty — or in some cases, entirely empty, an American official said.

Palestinian Americans in the West Bank or in Gaza were unable to get to those flights.

Asked about the lack of passengers, the State Department acknowledged the flights “consistently departed at half capacity or less.”

Cogat, a department of Israel’s defense ministry that administers aspects of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, cited the outbreak of the war to explain why crossings in the West Bank had been closed to Palestinian residents of the territory.

“In regards to Israel’s international crossings, nothing has changed. Palestinians with U.S. citizenship continue to enter Israel with a tourist visa,” Cogat said in a statement.

“Once Hamas commenced war on Israel, the crossings from Judea and Samaria into Israel were fully closed — for security reasons,” the agency said, using the Israeli term for the West Bank. “Israel will allow the entry of Palestinians holding U.S. passports for tourism purposes through the crossings in Judea and Samaria at the end of the closure, in accordance with the agreement signed between Israel and the U.S.A.”

94,94,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/us/politics/israel-biden-letter-gaza-cease-fire.html,"More than 500 political appointees and staff members representing some 40 government agencies sent a letter to President Biden on Tuesday protesting his support of Israel in its war in Gaza.

The letter, part of growing internal dissent over the administration’s support of the war, calls on the president to seek an immediate cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and to push Israel to allow humanitarian aid into the territory. It is the latest of several protest letters from officials throughout the Biden administration, including three internal memos to Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken signed by dozens of State Department employees as well as an open letter signed by more than 1,000 employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development.

The signatories of the letter submitted on Tuesday and the one circulating among USAID employees are anonymous, the USAID letter explains, out of “concern for our personal safety and risk of potentially losing our jobs.” The signatories of the State Department dissent cables must disclose their names, but those cables have not been released publicly.

Although the Biden administration has recently started voicing concern over the high numbers of Palestinian civilians killed while urging Israel to show restraint, that budding criticism does not appear to be placating many in the U.S. government.

The letter, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, began by denouncing the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, then urged Mr. Biden to stop the bloodshed caused by Israel’s retaliatory military campaign in Gaza.

“We call on President Biden to urgently demand a cease-fire; and to call for de-escalation of the current conflict by securing the immediate release of the Israeli hostages and arbitrarily detained Palestinians; the restoration of water, fuel, electricity and other basic services; and the passage of adequate humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip,” the letter states.

Organizers continued to collect signatures even after the letter was delivered to Mr. Biden, and by Tuesday afternoon the letter had about 100 more names than the 402 with which it was formally submitted. The letter’s organizers said they intended to inform the White House daily of updated signature counts.

Two political appointees who helped organize the letter to Mr. Biden said the majority of the signatories are political appointees of various faiths who work throughout government, from the National Security Council to the F.B.I. and the Justice Department.

Some of the signatories helped Mr. Biden get elected in 2020 and said in interviews they were concerned that the administration’s support of Israel’s war in Gaza clashed with Democratic voters’ stance on the issue.

“The overwhelming majority of Americans support a cease-fire,” the letter states, linking to a poll from October that shows that 66 percent of Americans, including 80 percent of Democrats, believe the United States should put pressure on Israel for a cease-fire.

“Furthermore, Americans do not want the U.S. military to be drawn into another costly and senseless war in the Middle East.”

Israel launched a ground invasion last month in Gaza in response to bloody attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7 that killed about 1,200 people, according to the Israeli government. So far, more than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s military offensive according to Gaza’s health ministry."
95,95,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/world/middleeast/satellite-images-show-israeli-tanks-600-feet-from-al-shifa-hospital.html,"Satellite images show that Israeli forces are stationed one block from Al-Shifa, the biggest hospital in Gaza City, an area that has been the site of intensified fighting in recent days.

The Times obtained and analyzed the images, taken Tuesday by a commercial satellite image provider, that show Israeli armored vehicles, likely tanks, 600 feet southwest of the hospital compound. A larger group of Israeli military vehicles is positioned at a school 1,000 feet northeast of Al-Shifa."
96,96,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/us/politics/fbi-hamas-israel-threats.html,"Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said on Wednesday that the bureau had opened a slew of investigations into Hamas as it tries to thwart potential attacks and stymie financial support for the militant group.

“We also have a large number of tips and leads related specifically to Hamas and radicalization and recruitment,” Mr. Wray said in testimony before the House Committee on Homeland Security about worldwide threats to the United States. “We are urgently running down every tip and lead.”

He added, “We cannot — and do not — discount the possibility that Hamas or another foreign terrorist organization may exploit the current conflict to conduct attacks here, on our own soil.”

Mr. Wray’s comments reflected rising concern among senior F.B.I. officials that Hamas’s brazen assault on Israel last month that left about 1,200 dead could inspire similar attacks, including in the United States, as well as provide the terrorist organization with more financial backing.

In the past, Hamas has not been a top priority for American intelligence agencies and federal law enforcement. Indeed, the White House’s 2022 national security strategy refers to the Islamic State and Al Qaeda but makes no mention of Hamas, an indication that the United States has typically not considered the group a direct threat.

Since the Hamas attack, Mr. Wray said, “we’ve seen a rogue’s gallery of foreign terrorist organizations call for attacks against Americans and our allies,” naming Hezbollah, the Islamic State and Al Qaeda.

He added, “We’ve kept our sights on Hamas and have multiple investigations into individuals affiliated with that foreign terrorist organization.”

Among those killed on Oct. 7 were about three dozen American citizens, with another 10 unaccounted for. It is unclear how many Americans were among those that Hamas and other Palestinian groups kidnapped that day and ferried back to Gaza. The Israeli government is still trying to identify human remains. So far, 859 Israeli civilians slain in the attack have been identified.

Mr. Wray also pointed to the threat from Hamas in urging lawmakers to reauthorize a key surveillance tool, known as Section 702, which is set to expire by the end of this year. All of the intelligence on the group that is gathered from electronic surveillance, as opposed to human informants, was assembled using that particular section of the law, he said.

It would be “a wildly irresponsible risk” if Congress did not reauthorize it, he added.

Mr. Wray reiterated concerns he had raised during a hearing last month with senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee, in which he noted the escalating threats against Jews and Muslims in the United States.

Of particular concern are attacks from violent extremists or lone actors in the United States fueled by calls to violence, Mr. Wray said on Wednesday, pointing to “homegrown violent extremists inspired by a foreign terrorist organization, and domestic violent extremists targeting Jewish Americans or other faith communities, like Muslim Americans.”

Mr. Wray added that the “biggest chunk of the threats that have been reported, by a good margin,” had been to the Jewish community, including synagogues and Jewish leaders.

Last month, Mr. Wray, citing statistics from 2022, noted that despite representing less than 3 percent of the American population, Jews were the target of about 60 percent of the religious-based hate crimes.

Although Mr. Wray had a mostly friendly reception on Wednesday, Clay Higgins, a Republican congressman from Louisiana, took aim at the director and peddled a conspiratorial claim that has circulated in right-wing circles about the F.B.I.’s role on Jan. 6.

In a heated exchange, Mr. Wray said neither F.B.I. agents nor informants had orchestrated the violence on Jan. 6 at the Capitol. “The answer is, emphatically not,” Mr. Wray said, his temper rising.

Mr. Higgins was not satisfied.

“Your day is coming, Mr. Wray,” he said."
97,97,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/world/middleeast/israel-palestinians-standing-together.html,"It’s a message that has not been prominently heard or seen in many American protests and rallies. Most events have taken place under an Israeli or Palestinian flag, focusing on one people’s pain, struggle or victimhood.

That type of narrow approach can erase everything around it, said Cara Raich, a conflict adviser based in New York.

“As with most conflicts one feels deeply and personally, a binary choice often offers the simple comfort of pro and con, or right and wrong,” she said. “The magnetic power of false binaries sucks everything that it touches into that paradigm.”

For that reason, the conversations Mr. Green and Ms. Abed came to have with Americans have, at least for their audiences they draw, been something of a spiritual salve. In dozens of talks up and down the East Coast, the two activists have described a desperate need for new Israeli and Palestinian leadership, including leaders willing to work together.

They have called Hamas, the group that controls the Gaza Strip, both “the enemy of the Palestinian people” and a “fertilizer for radical Jewish extremism.” And they have voiced a frustration over what they see as a war for the moral high ground, happening outside of Israel and mostly over social media, that denies their experiences.

Libby Lenkinski, a vice president at the New Israel Fund, an organization that funds and supports Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups, has had a front-row seat as a moderator. She said she has seen a “palpable sense of relief” among attendees who audibly exhale or place hands over their hearts. The message is so resonant, she said, because of it offers a different kind of simplicity than choosing one of two sides.

“This isn’t, ‘Kumbaya, let’s all hold hands and love each other,’” Ms. Lenkinski said. “It’s: ‘There’s actually no way that one side is going to win. Our futures are intertwined and the only way that we can keep ourselves alive is by keeping each other alive.’”"
99,99,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/nyregion/aoc-torres-israel-gaza.html,"“This is pursuing a proven and failed strategy,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a recent radio interview. “So why do it, why kill kids, why put people in danger, why perpetuate these cycles when we’ve done it so many times, and it’s never kept us safe?”

Yet five years after she burst onto the political stage, even some critics say Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s approach has become more nuanced, as she attempts to balance the demands of a leftist movement that holds justice for Palestinians as a key plank and includes large numbers of Jewish voters with varying views on the conflict. (Her own safely Democratic district in Queens and the Bronx is largely Latino, Black and Asian, with only small Jewish and Arab populations.)

Calls for a cease-fire by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and others drew a stern rebuke from the White House, and she faced backlash for voting against a bipartisan resolution that expressed strong support for Israel. But she has also taken steps to differentiate herself from allies like Representatives Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Cori Bush of Missouri, sidestepping some of the left’s most inflammatory critiques — like accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza — to focus on the war’s mounting human cost.

Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who did not agree to an interview, met in Washington last month with the families of Jewish hostages kidnapped by Hamas. She has repeatedly condemned the group and supports a two-state solution shunned by some on the left. And at a time when many liberal Jews feel they are being abandoned by the left, she has warned about “disgusting and unacceptable” antisemitism in a post to 8.4 million Instagram followers, saying, “No movement of integrity should tolerate it.”

“You can see how hard Alexandria is trying to listen compassionately across the lines of this conflict,” said Brad Lander, the left-leaning New York City comptroller who is the highest-ranking Jewish city official. “I’m not saying anyone is doing it perfectly, but there is a difference between trying and not trying.”

More moderate Jewish Democrats have also taken note. Representative Dan Goldman of New York, who along with Mr. Torres voted this week to censure Ms. Tlaib for using divisive pro-Palestinian rhetoric, said he and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had “made a conscious effort to keep an open line of communication” even if they did not always agree on the conflict.

On the other side of the Bronx River, Mr. Torres, 35, who is gay and Afro-Latino, has staked out a strikingly different project to the right of many of his peers, offering himself as a counterweight to his party’s leftward lurch.

His own social media following is relatively small — 170,000 followers on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s 13.2 million — but the combativeness of Mr. Torres’s retorts has stood out. In just the last few days, he compared a cease-fire to asking Israel to “become the author of its own annihilation,” called claims that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza “blood libel” and argued that most Israelis are not actually white, as those who see the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a racial struggle claim, but “people of color in the American sense.”

Mr. Torres has reserved special vitriol for the Democratic Socialists of America, the small but influential leftist group that has pushed for boycotts of Israel and counts Ms. Ocasio-Cortez as a member. In an interview, he said that the D.S.A. was trying to infiltrate the Democratic Party “to impose the ideological litmus tests on Israel” and “cleanse” those who disagree with them. He said he was on a “publicly stated mission” to undermine it.

“I do worry that the next generation is increasingly indoctrinated with anti-Israel hate so virulent that it renders them indifferent to the coldblooded murder of Jews in Israel,” he said.

His views are no surprise to those who watched Mr. Torres, a proud college dropout and defender of public housing, evolve from left-aligned political upstart to more traditional Democratic congressman.

Though he represents an overwhelmingly Black and Latino district that includes only several thousand Jewish voters, he has improbably made the conflict 5,700 miles away a top priority since 2015, when he traveled to Israel on a City Council delegation. It was his first trip abroad, and Mr. Torres said witnessing both the fragility of the frontier and Tel Aviv’s openness to gay life left him with “profound empathy” for Israel and a commitment to a two-state solution.

His combativeness has infuriated the left. Waleed Shahid, a progressive strategist who is close to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, called Mr. Torres “a propagandist for the Israeli government.”

Jeremy Cohan, a leader of the D.S.A.’s New York City chapter, said Mr. Torres was unfairly conflating criticism of Israel with antisemitism. “It is opportunistic, it is gross, it is personally offensive to me as a Jew,” he said.

It remains far from clear how many left-leaning Democrats Mr. Torres is moving. Even some senior colleagues who agree with him privately worry that his approach may alienate some Black, Latino and other progressive voters at a time when their support is critical.

And yet, his actions have resonated on a visceral level with many American Jews facing one of the most frightening periods since the Holocaust, and have brought him a new level of political celebrity."

From New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.” This week on the show, we wanted to put a Palestinian narrative and perspective on this moment, on how we got to this moment, on what is happening here, alongside an Israeli one. We had Amjad Iraqi, the Palestinian writer and policy analyst on the show on Tuesday. If you haven’t listened to that episode, I really urge you to do so. And today, we have Yossi Klein Halevi for an Israeli perspective, for a Zionist perspective. Halevi is a Senior Fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem. He’s the author of, among other books, “Letters to my Palestinian Neighbor.” He’s somebody who spent quite a lot of his life trying to make the Israeli narrative understood to others, a narrative he feels, and has lived very deeply. He is somebody who believes that narratives that are contradictory, narratives that even oppose each other will have to be held at the same time, that reconciliation, if it ever comes, is not going to come because one story gets judged true and the other false, but because both stories and the many more can be held at the same time, respected, without asking one to triumph over all the others. At the same time, I want to recognize that this is not just a moment of stories. This is a moment when real people have died and are dying, when real people have been driven from their homes, when bombs are dropping, there was a real massacre in Israel, not just a story, there’s a real invasion of Gaza. And something else I wanted to talk to Halevi about, as somebody who has covered quite a bit of Israeli security, who has written a book on the Israeli military at one point, or at least a story of the Israeli paratroopers, is, how Israel is thinking about this moment and what it is trying to achieve in the invasion of Gaza. What does it mean to destroy Hamas? What if it cannot do that? What is the acceptable cost? Is there a cost in civilians that is too much? So we talked through that. As with the previous conversation, not everything in this episode is easy to hear for everyone. Not everything in this episode is something I agree with. But I think it is important to hear. I think it is important to understand what these two societies see right now, the way they understand their interests, the way they understand their past and the way they understand what could potentially be in their future. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. Yossi Klein Halevi, welcome to the show.

yossi klein halevi

Great to be with you, Ezra. Thank you.

ezra klein

I want to start with a little bit of your history. You talk about being a soldier, patrolling Gaza, when you were younger, being part of that occupation and learning things on both sides from it. What did you learn from it? What did it change in your thinking?

yossi klein halevi

So I was drafted into the Israeli army in the late 1980s, which was the period that we call the first intifada. It’s like the first Lebanon war. We didn’t know there was going to be a second or maybe a third. We just called it the intifada then. And my unit served in the Gaza refugee camps. We also served in the West Bank. And I came out of that experience learning two things. The first is that the rule over another people is untenable, in the long term, for a country that wants to be both a democracy and maintain its Jewish majority. And that was a lesson that I learned viscerally. I learned that every day. And it was an overwhelming experience. The second experience was a direct encounter with the depth, not only of Palestinian rage, and in many cases, hatred, but with the negation of any legitimacy to a Jewish state in any borders. Just before our unit had gotten to Gaza, an Israeli reservist, driving through Gaza, had made a wrong turn, and ended up in a refugee camp, and was surrounded and burned alive. And we used to get taunted every day that Amnon — that was his name, Amnon. Amnon sends you regards. So my education was the futility of occupation, on the one hand, and on the other, deep questions about whether we could really negotiate a two-state solution with the Palestinian national movement that would be ready to accept the legitimacy of Israel in whatever borders. And that education has shaped my thinking to this day. And the way that I would put it, Ezra, is that on the one hand, I believe that a Palestinian state is an existential need for Israel. And I also believe it’s an existential threat, especially given what we’ve just experienced on Oct. 7. The possibility of taking the risk of withdrawing from the West Bank any time soon, and bringing Hamas to within literally five minutes of Tel Aviv, is simply inconceivable for Israelis today, I would say virtually across the political spectrum. But the one thing that I will say, just to counter that a little bit, is that I’ve learned, in Israel, really never to make definitive statements about the future, even the near future, because it’s so unpredictable. This is such a radically fluid reality. A month ago, I was standing in the streets, literally every week, with hundreds of thousands of Israelis, demonstrating against the Netanyahu government. Today, this is suddenly the most unified country that we’ve been for decades. And we keep going from one contradictory reality to the next. And that’s so built into the Israeli experience. And in a paradoxical way, that gives me some hope for the future because those who say a two-state solution is over, it’s dead, it’s finished, so how do know? Look at what just happened in Israel in the last five weeks. How can you make any definitive statement about this crazy place?

ezra klein

You mentioned the first intifada. And I want to talk about how both intifadas changed Israeli politics. And so beginning with what, as you put it, nobody knew was the first one at the time, what was the first intifada? And how did Israel react to it? How did it change Israeli politics?

yossi klein halevi

Well, the first intifada broke out in 1987. And it lasted more or less until the first Gulf War, 1991. It was basically riots. It was young people — large, very large numbers, hundreds, thousands of young people, throwing stones, sometimes Molotov cocktails, every so often, a terror attack. But primarily, it was — the Palestinians call it the intifada of stones. And that’s how I personally experienced it. I got a stone thrown to my head. And I was briefly hospitalized for that. Luckily, I had a helmet on. And I still blacked out. And there was something visceral about experiencing a rock in your head because a rock is a symbol of powerlessness — I mean, David and Goliath. And it was this encounter with Gaza’s rage. And I also had a very complicated experience. I came to respect these Palestinian teenagers who were throwing rocks at my friends and me. We were armed. And there was a great deal of courage. And I recognized, myself, as a teenager, in their rage. I was a very strong participant in Jewish activism when I was a teenager in the late ‘60s, early ‘70s, in the Soviet Jewry Movement, in the violent wing of the Soviet Jewry Movement, fighting police at the Soviet Mission. And I identified, to some extent, with these kids. And I felt this grudging respect for them. And so it was a very complicated dynamic. And I came out of that experience saying, there’s no way to suppress this. We’re going to have to come to terms with Palestinian nationalism. And this was true for a very large number of Israelis. I saw it happening in the Army. And every night we would have arguments in our tent camp in Gaza. And you saw even people on the right saying, something has to give here. This isn’t working. And the political consequence of the first intifada was the election of Yitzhak Rabin in 1992. Rabin ran on the slogan, “Take Gaza out of Tel Aviv.” That was the winning post-intifada slogan of Israeli politics — separation. Let — whatever they want to do. A state? Give them a state. There was something of that mood in Israeli society, a realization that we can’t swallow another people, a people that doesn’t want to be part of us and whom we don’t see as part of the identity we were trying to create in Israel. So it was a moment of possibility. A year later, the Oslo peace process. And that again, a direct outgrowth of the first intifada. Technically, Israel won the first intifada. We suppressed the riots. It took four or five years. But the riots stopped. But we lost. And we all knew we lost the first intifada because you can’t win that kind of conflict. And the ‘90s, at least the early ‘90s, was the time where people like me, who had experienced the intifada literally in our being, felt we needed to try a different way.

So then let me ask the same question of the second intifada. What was it? What were the tactics of it? And how did it change Israeli politics and society?

yossi klein halevi

So the second intifada broke out in the year 2000, September 2000. And the second intifada was the intifada of suicide bombings. And that went on for five years. And those were the longest five years of my life. And I was raising two teenagers in Jerusalem at the time. Jerusalem was one of the main center points of the suicide bombings. And my kids had numerous close encounters. And they both lost friends. Friends were wounded. That intifada changed Israeli politics in the opposite way of the first intifada. It brought the right to power pretty much permanently over the last 20 plus years. And it wasn’t only the intensity of the terrorism. It was the fact that it happened after Israel had said yes to two peace offers. Now, the Palestinians have a very different version of what I’m about to tell you. I’m going to give you the Israeli narrative of what happened. Almost all Israelis deeply believe this, as do I. This is my narrative of what happened, as well. And that is that at Camp David, in July 2000, Israel put an offer on the table of an Israeli withdrawal, a Palestinian state. It would have involved uprooting dozens of settlements, redefining Jerusalem. And on the Palestinian side, it would have expected the Palestinians to contract the right of return, not to the literal lost homes of the 1948 War, in what is now the state of Israel, but to a part of the Palestinian homeland that would be a Palestinian state, which is to say the West Bank and Gaza. And Arafat walked away from that offer. Six months later, President Clinton put on the table what he called the Clinton Proposals, which essentially changed the territorial withdrawal to the equivalent of 100 percent. And I say equivalent because Israel would have kept about 4 percent to 5 percent of the West Bank, that’s closest to the border, in exchange for territory within pre-1967 sovereign Israel. And Clinton adopted the Israeli position that the Palestinians have to confine the right of return to a Palestinian state, and not to the state of Israel. And the Palestinians claim that Arafat did not reject it. The Israelis claim that Arafat did reject it. This is all by way of trying to explain what the second intifada did to the Israeli psyche. If you believe that your side genuinely tried to make peace, and received, in return, the worst wave of terrorism in Israel’s history, then your first conclusion is going to be that the Israeli left, which promised us peace now, are simply fools. And that’s exactly what happened. The Israeli left collapsed immediately after the second intifada began. And it never recovered. The Labor Party today is the smallest party in Parliament, four seats. The Zionist party to the left of Labor, called Meretz, isn’t even in Parliament. That was the shift of the second intifada.

ezra klein

There are a lot of claims and counterclaims about the offers made and who rejected them and whether or not the state would have been a viable entity in the way it was offered. And to be honest, I don’t, myself, have a very strong opinion on this. But you can believe of any number of things about how good the offers were and whether or not the Palestinians should have taken them. And that can be separate from your belief about what follows — a multiyear terrorism campaign targeting civilians in the most crowded public spaces that the attackers can find. And so I just wanted to spend a moment on that. I think metaphors and comparisons to the Holocaust and to 9/11 are very dominant right now in the Western conversation. But when I talk to Israelis, what I hear as being the most dominant near experience, or maybe one, the Yom Kippur War, but very much two, the second intifada, which shapes, I think, all thinking about, what are the terms under which security can and cannot be attained?

yossi klein halevi

Yeah, it’s interesting because my father raised me with the consciousness that the non-Jewish world is divided into two kinds of people. There are those who actively want to kill us and there are those who are glad that someone else is doing the job. And my maturation process was learning to break from that survivor mind-set that my father really tried to impose on me. And I understand why, given his experience. But in the 1990s, parts of Israeli society were beginning to distance ourselves — and I was certainly very much part of that — from an excessive dependence on the Holocaust as a framing for Israeli and Jewish identity. And there was a very positive, a really healthy conversation that was beginning. And then the second intifada happens. And all of the trauma returns. And the Jewish survival button was pushed. And that’s a very dangerous thing for the enemies of Israel to do because when that button is pushed, you can’t win.

ezra klein

So I think this gets at this important — sometimes this disconnect, I think, between how Israel sees itself and how it’s seen by the world. In its early decades, Israel saw itself — and I think was, and was seen this way — as a fairly weak country that was really threatened with eradication. By the second intifada, and certainly today, Israel is a strong country. It has a powerful military. It is a big economy. So could you talk about that shift, and the way that the external perception of Israel and its strength is not always mirrored in the Israeli psyche, in the way Israel understands itself?

yossi klein halevi

I think you’re pointing to one of the seminal disconnects between how Israelis view their situation and how outsiders perceive Israel. Israelis are certainly aware of the power they have, both economic and military. But we experience our existence in the Middle East as vulnerable. And being vulnerable is not the same as being a victim. Israelis don’t consider themselves victims, even after the massacre of Oct. 7. It’s not in the Israeli mind-set to see ourselves as victims. Victimhood isn’t considered noble at all in Israel, where the Israeli ethos is a response to victimhood. It’s an attempt to erase the victimhood of the Jewish people. But we do feel acutely vulnerable. And the reason for that is that people abroad tend to think of the Middle East conflict as Israel versus the Palestinians. And through that lens, Israel is Goliath and the Palestinians are David. But if you widen the map, if you look at Israel in the region, we experience the Middle East conflict as literally that — the Middle East, or much of the Middle East, against the Jewish state. That’s been the reality. And so Israelis have a split screen in our heads when we think of the conflict. One side is mighty Israel against the powerless Palestinians. And the other side is vulnerable Israel against a vast Arab and Muslim world. And the more vulnerable you make us, the more traumatized we become, the more we feel we’re in a survival mode, the harder we push back. And when Israelis break — and we really broke on Oct. 7 — we don’t break in the way that Hamas and its allies anticipated. We don’t fall apart. We come together. And look at how we came together on Oct. 8. Literally, on Oct. 6, we were at each other’s throats. I was really worried about Civil War in Israel. And then Oct. 7 happens, the single greatest trauma in Israel’s history. I look back on the second intifada now. In the second intifada, for five years of suicide bombings, a thousand Israelis were killed. We lost 1,400 people the first day of this war, on Oct. 7. So the dimensions are something that we’ve never experienced before. And the fatal mistake — and I believe it is a fatal mistake — of Hamas. And it will be a fatal mistake of Hezbollah if they join the war — is that you cannot defeat this people from that place, that mind-set, of existential threat. And what’s so astonishing — and this is also part of this deep disconnect between the Israeli psyche and so much of the outside world — is the outside world sees a war between Israel and Hamas. And we see this as an existential war for salvaging our credibility as a country able to defend itself. And that really will have long-term consequences.

ezra klein

I want to hold on the pre-Oct. 7 equilibrium for one more question, before we move fully into it, which is, as somebody who — I’ve been to Israel a number of times. I care about Israel. I used to be more involved on the peace side in this issue. In between the second intifada and Oct. 7, one thing that had become very unclear to me, depressingly, frighteningly unclear, was what the implicit theory was, of both long-term Israeli security, but also justice. So you had a blockade on Gaza and a sort of immiseration of the Gazan people, which Hamas bears quite a bit of responsibility for, but was also enforced, in part, by Israel. You had a lot of settlement activity in the West Bank. You had Israeli politics moving further and further right. You had no real effort to negotiate with Abbas. And Netanyahu says, in closed-door Likud meetings, that it’s a strategy to keep the Palestinians divided. And there was a security, right? There was a wall. There had been the withdrawal from Gaza. It seemed that the theory was, to me, that you could keep this stable and keep a lid on the dangers with anti-rocket systems, with a wall, with surveillance, with intelligence. But there’s no longer a sense that there was or could be or was really a need for any kind of political solution. So how would you describe what people in Israel thought the long term of this looked like on 10/1.

yossi klein halevi

We were living with several illusions of these last two decades. One illusion was that we can maintain the status quo indefinitely. When you have a status quo, you create a vacuum in which the most determined part of Israeli society can take advantage. And that happened to be the settlers. They know exactly where they want to bring us. The rest of us don’t really know. We’re confused. It wasn’t that we don’t need a solution. It’s that a solution is impossible. It’s unattainable. That was the imprint of the second intifada, the combined Israeli reading of, we offered the Palestinian leadership peace, we got back the second intifada in return. The result of that was, there’s no point. There’s no one to make peace with. Now it’s true that for most of the last two decades, we didn’t offer a credible vision of peace, with one major exception, which was Prime Minister Ehud Olmert offered Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, effectively a total Israeli withdrawal. And it’s true that Olmert was already a lame duck. And his days as prime minister were numbered when he made that offer. But if you’re the head of a people that’s under occupation and your goal is a two-state solution, and the Israeli prime minister has just offered you a credible vision of a Palestinian state, do you just walk away? Or do you pocket that offer and then say, well, the previous prime minister made this offer. And you present this to the following prime minister. In other words, there is such a fundamental lack of seriousness on the part of the Palestinian leadership toward extracting their people from occupation, that my conclusion, as somebody who desperately believes that we need a long-term, two-state solution — I’m emphasizing right now, in the middle of this war, long term — that I don’t believe that, even if you had the most left-wing government in power in Israel today, that we’d be able to reach an agreement with the Palestinian National Movement in any of its factions. And if I believe that, I think it’s fair to say that most Israeli Jews believe that, as well. I see it as a tragedy. The Settlement Movement and its supporters see that as a victory. But I think that a majority of Israelis don’t know what to think anymore. And I’m there too right now, Ezra. I don’t know what to think right now. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

One thing I’ve heard from Palestinians I’ve spoken to, without justifying what Hamas did, is a sense that Palestinians had tried many nonviolent efforts to move the Israeli state to change perception towards them. What they could do in the first intifada, given the integration of the societies, was no longer true, now that the fence was up, now that the separations are what they are. And so there are things like the Boycott Movement, which think Israel treated as a quite profound threat, and got criminalized in many places. There was the March of Return, that ended up having a number of Palestinians killed during it. And they felt — stymied is too soft a word. But from your perspective, what is it that Palestinians could have or should have done in this period that would have worked to open up a different set of possibilities here?

yossi klein halevi

Two things. The first is an acceptance of the Indigenousness of the Jewish people in this land. No Palestinian leader that I know has said that. The second is the practical application of acceptance of a Jewish majority state, which is not to make a peace agreement contingent on Israel accepting vast numbers of the descendants of refugees back into the 1967 state, which would destroy the Jewish majority. In other words, from the perspective of an overwhelming majority of Israeli Jews, the key is the legitimacy of a Jewish majority state. Now you mentioned B.D.S. You mentioned the March of Return. The B.D.S. movement is committed to what Palestinians call the Right of Return. The March of Return was literally that. We are going to inundate Israel with the descendants of Palestinian refugees. B.D.S. and the March of Return were both, we can say, technically peaceful. B.D.S. was peaceful. March of Return was accompanied by a great deal of violence. But the March of Return and B.D.S. have, as their goal, the destruction of Israel. Now I don’t care if you destroy Israel through Oct. 7 or through a March of Return, because in the end, the result will be the unbearable vulnerability of Israeli Jews, who will no longer be able to defend themselves. And in that sense, there’s no difference between that and the goal of Oct. 7. There’s a difference in tactic. But what I’m looking for is not a change in tactic. I’m looking for a change in goal. Are you still committed to the destruction of a Jewish state through peaceful means? Thank you very much. That’s a non-starter for me. You are trying to destroy the last, best hope of the Jewish people. And I don’t care if it’s technically anti-Semitic or not. I actually don’t care if the motive is anti-Semitic. The intent here doesn’t matter. The consequence will be the effective destruction of the Jewish people. We will not survive as a people without the state of Israel.

ezra klein

In your heart of hearts, how do you think the average Palestinian sees you and sees Israel? At your most honest, what do you think they really think of you?

yossi klein halevi

I would say that until Oct. 7 — and I’ll explain why in a moment — your average Palestinian thought two things about Israel. One is it has no legitimacy. It is a country that’s based on theft and lies. There was no ancient Jewish presence in this land. It’s all a Zionist myth. The Holocaust is probably either an exaggeration or an outright lie. And that’s what Palestinian society hears routinely from its media from its leaders. And on the other hand, I sense that the average Palestinian had a certain admiration for Israel — an admiration for Israel’s success, for the fact that we’ve proven that we’re ready to sacrifice ourselves for this country, the deep love and attachment that we have, in a way, proves that we’re an indigenous people, in the same way — and that’s what I respect about Palestinians, that deep attachment to the land and the willingness to sacrifice for the land. And I think that the paradox here is that on the one hand, they see us as a colonialist intrusion, and on the other hand, they see Israelis as behaving exactly as they do, which is, this is how an indigenous people fights for its land.

ezra klein

Let’s talk about Oct. 7 and its aftermath now. You said something in a conversation with Rabbi David Wolpe that I found very important, which was that even beyond the murders, even beyond the hostages, that a core trauma here was that Israel had become the most dangerous country in the world for Jews, that the fundamental contract of the Israeli state had been broken —

yossi klein halevi

With the Jewish people.

ezra klein

— with the Jewish people.

yossi klein halevi

Yes.

ezra klein

Can you talk about that dimension of it, the cracking of the Israeli narrative about itself?

yossi klein halevi

When Israelis used to say “never again,” we didn’t mean that never again would there be an existential threat to the Jewish people because that’s out of our control. What we did mean is that never again would Jews die in a state of helplessness. The lasting trauma, the greatest trauma, that’s going to be with us, I would say, for generations, is that a thousand Israeli civilians — there were 1,400 hundreds killed altogether. About 400 were soldiers. But a thousand Israeli civilians died with their hands bound behind their backs, in the most horrific ways that Jews have ever been murdered. And it happened within the borders of a sovereign Jewish state, with the Israeli army seemingly incapacitated for hours. That is a historic — it’s not just a failure. It’s a collapse of the Israeli ethos. It’s a collapse of our most basic sense of ourselves, of what this country is about. And that’s also what we’re fighting for today. And a lot of well-intentioned people who tell us cease-fire don’t understand what’s at stake here, for Israel. I think there’s a big question mark all over the Arab and Muslim worlds about whether Israel is really viable in the long term. The defeat, the humiliation of Oct. 7 was so profound, the fact that we were beaten by the weakest of our enemies — which is how we always related to Hamas. Hamas is the least of our problems. We’ve got Hezbollah. We’ve got Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Syria and Iran, of course, hovering in the background. And to be defeated so totally by Hamas means that we don’t have deterrence anymore. And that, by the way, is what this war is about most of all for Israel. And we all know it here. This is the war to restore the credibility of Israeli deterrence.

ezra klein

I want to quote something you said on that because I found it very important. You said in recent days, I’ve received messages from friends abroad, warning me that Israel is about to repeat the mistakes America made in Afghanistan and Iraq. You’re walking into a trap, they say. There is no quick fix. Hamas is an idea, not just a movement. And you go on to say that, “I fear they may be right. But those concerns are irrelevant to Israel’s most urgent need, which is the immediate restoration of our shattered deterrence.” What is deterrence? And what is the way in which what Israel is now doing, its current strategy, restores deterrence?

yossi klein halevi

So I think there are two aspects. There is an external deterrence toward the enemies on our borders. And there’s an internal reassurance to Israeli citizens that we’re still capable of protecting ourselves. In some ways, the internal deterrence is more important. If we stop believing that this country can fulfill its historic role of being a safe refuge for the Jewish people, many Israelis will leave. Israelis, like Jews all around the world, have a very healthy personal sense of survival. We don’t only have a collective sense of survival here. We also know, it might be time to leave. Jews in France have that sense. And antisemitism is now rising phenomenally in Europe, especially in France and England. And until Oct. 7, many French Jews, in response to what’s happening there, would have immediately applied for immigration to Israel. I don’t know if that’s going to happen now. And so the long-term consequences of Oct. 7 are core to what this country is about. And in terms of the external deterrents, I think that our enemies need to know that we’re not afraid to die in war. And there’s the sense — and you hear it from Hamas. You hear it from Hezbollah. You hear it from the Iranian regime — that Muslims don’t fear death, we embrace death. We’re fearless. The Jews are cowards. They cling to life. And yes, the Jews certainly cling to life. And that’s, I think, one of the most beautiful aspects of Judaism. But there are moments where you’re ready to sacrifice your life. And this is one of those defining moments.

ezra klein

I have a couple questions about that. So one, what makes you think, or what makes Israelis think, that Hamas or Israel’s enemies in the region had ceased to believe that about Israel? The one thing that I feel like everybody said universally, as soon as this happened, was that of course, this would create an overwhelming Israeli response, that there would be a huge, huge, huge attack on Gaza, that that was part of the calculus of the conflict, in a way.

yossi klein halevi

Well, Israel hasn’t won a war since 1973. And every war since was an asymmetrical conflict. And you can’t win an asymmetrical war unless you’re ready to go all the way. And Israel was not ready to go all the way. It is now. But our track record of the last 50 years has by no means been definitive and frankly, not necessarily impressive. And that’s one aspect of this. The other is that the more that Israel has become economically successful, the more we’ve come to resemble a consumerist Western society, the more the perception has grown that we’re soft. And many Israelis felt that way as well. The head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, gave a famous speech, I don’t know, 15 years ago, where he compared Israel to a spider. Web and he said that just as a spider web appears to be impenetrable from the outside, and then when you swipe it, it disintegrates, that’s Israel. And the Ayatollah Khomeini famously said, I think it was in 2015 or ‘16, that Israel has 25 years until its destruction. And there are doomsday clocks on street corners in Iranian cities that are marking time to the demise of Israel. And my sense is that Hamas expected another round of fighting, maybe more intense than the last 15 years. But I think that they believed we would be deterred for two reasons. First of all, the fact that they now have Israeli hostages. This is an unprecedented situation. They’re holding 240-plus hostages. And the second is I think that they were depending on world opinion, that at some point, world opinion will conclude that this has gone too far and Israel is out of control and the price is too high and innocent Palestinians are paying a price for Hamas did, all the scenarios that are playing out now.

ezra klein

You said a few minutes ago that Israel not won a war outright since the ‘70s because it’s not been willing to go all the way. What does it mean to go all the way?

yossi klein halevi

Well, I think that we’re seeing that in Gaza now. So going all the way means continuing this war with all of the horrific consequences, and even endangering large numbers of Israeli civilians. Now how that’s actually going to play out, will Israelis have the stomach for staring down Hamas over the hostages? I don’t know. I really don’t know.

ezra klein

So I’ve had two thoughts through a lot of this. One is that the Israeli determination to destroy Hamas is almost the basic function of a state right now, that there is no state in the world that would absorb the kind of attack Hamas conducted and not do everything in its power to rip it out, root and branch. And also, that sometimes where I would expect to hear a description of how Israel is going to do the thing that it is promising to do at acceptable cost — and I am somebody who believes there are unacceptable costs that end up backfiring against the very things you’re trying to preserve — I’ve not heard much. And I think one of the things that has unnerved me more is that the truth is — and I don’t think this is all that unusual, even within Israel — I don’t have very much faith in the Israeli government. Netanyahu has been a disaster. But also, the Israeli Defense Forces were able to see a huge amount of open-air training and what they thought were war games, and there was intelligence coming up through their people, and still couldn’t see what was about to happen. And so then the idea that they have the level of intelligence needed to know if the 7,000 targets they bombed are the right targets, or when they invade Gaza, which houses to go into, that’s been a real question for me, that it seems that Hamas might want to lure Israel into this. And it’s not a 100 percent clear that Israel knows what it is in, that right now, just having Netanyahu or the I.D.F. say, trust us, we have the knowledge here, the intelligence, a sense of Palestinian informers and psychology needed to conduct this such that we achieve our goals, beyond just showing that we are willing to go to all-out war, that’s been a point of real concern. And I’m curious how you think about that.

yossi klein halevi

Yeah, well first, I would just quibble with you about one point. You said you don’t have a whole lot of faith in Netanyahu. I have less than zero faith in Netanyahu. I think he is an unqualified historic disaster for Israel, and especially over the last year. The fact that he’s technically the prime minister at this moment — and I say technically because for a vast number of Israelis, he has no authority anymore. He has no moral legitimacy. What does give me some confidence is that we have Benny Gantz, the head of one of the opposition parties, and a former I.D.F. chief of staff, now sitting in government, together with his party. And there are any number of serious military people who’ve joined the government with Benny Gantz. And Benny Gantz is also running in the polls as far and away the most popular choice for next prime minister. And in all likelihood, he will be the next prime minister. In terms of the army, it’s hard to know what’s worse, if you have the intelligence and you fundamentally misread it, or you don’t have the intelligence. In this case, the army did have intelligence. And they misread it. They misread it because of a doctrine which Netanyahu promoted all these years, and the army adopted. The army is certainly not free of blame here. And the doctrine was that Hamas is too weak to attack us. I feel, and the polls show, that this is true for a strong majority of Israelis, that the people running the army are still trustworthy. Look, when this war ends, they will all have to resign, along with the government. This generation of leaders, both politically and militarily, are finished. But I believe that they are able to fight this war in the same way that the IDF command, in 1973, was able to very effectively fight the Yom Kippur War, even though they had failed to anticipate it. And so I have trust in the current leadership. I think it’s a tragedy that we’re going to lose them because as I say, every one of them is going to have to resign. We’re going to see a total turnover of generations, certainly militarily and hopefully politically. But I do believe that they’re capable of reading the map now. And look, I only have one I.D.F.. The Jewish people only has one I.D.F. And in Hebrew we say, [SPEAKING HEBREW], that’s what we’ve got. And so for lack of an alternative, I trust — I trust the I.D.F. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

You described earlier feeling, for many, many years — and I thought it was, frankly, the correct feeling — genuinely confused about what the right path forward was, that there was a kind of status quo, and the status quo was unsatisfying. But there wasn’t an obvious answer here. And I’ve felt that then. But I also feel that now. One of the particular ways in which I feel that, I take seriously the importance of deterrence. I also take seriously, and something that you gestured at, the idea that Hamas and things like Hamas are an idea as much as an organization, and that the rage that Israelis feel when their countrymen, when their brothers and sisters are killed, is also shared by Palestinians when their brothers and sisters and fathers and mothers and children are killed, and that if 15 or 20,000 Gazans die, that is a rage that will find its way to being answered. I’m not convinced you can destroy Hamas. I’ve talked to terrorism experts and people who study counterterrorism. And this kind of asymmetric thing, I’m not sure you can go so far such that things like Hamas do not emerge. How do you think about that side of it, again, recognizing that you have to do something to degrade Hamas, and also, that many more grieving people is its own kind of powder keg. When you think of not just the day after, but the 20 years after, how do you balance those considerations?

yossi klein halevi

Look, it’s a really important question. I would just pick up, for a moment, on the word “degrade,” that you used. That’s the dividing line between the normative Israeli position, the position on the street, the position in the Army, in government, and probably the position in the West, even among many of our supporters, which is, maybe it’s enough to just degrade Hamas. And the position here is that if the Hamas leadership remains in Gaza, and they emerge from the ruins of this war with the V-sign, then Oct. 7 stands. And this is a war against Oct. 7. And it’s not enough to degrade Hamas. Now I take very seriously what you’re saying. This could poison any possibility for reconciliation for, God knows, the next generation. That’s one possibility. There’s another option. And this has also happened in the Middle East. And that is that after the Yom Kippur War, Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin made peace. And nobody saw that coming until Sadat got off a plane at Ben Gurion Airport. Now this is different. That was a war between armies. And this war is a war of one home front against the other. This is a civilian war as much as anything else. Those are much more bitter conflicts. So do I really think that the Sadat-Begin scenario is what’s going to come out of this? I don’t. But I’m not sure. And I think a lot depends on what happens in the wider Arab and Muslim worlds on the morning after, if there is a willingness to sit down with Israel and say, OK, it can’t go on this way, here’s what we need, what do you need, before we even bring in the Palestinians. And then if that dynamic begins, then you turn to the Palestinian question. Now obviously, that can’t happen with this Israeli government. But I believe that there will be enormous political changes in Israel when this is over. And before we really can think about questions in the region and relations, certainly with the Palestinians, there’s going to need to be a political upheaval in this country the likes of which we’ve never seen before. And that’s coming.

ezra klein

I want to pick up on something you said there, about this question of normative goals and then what I would call this question of maybe limits, because I wouldn’t frame degrading Hamas, using that language around it, as a normative goal. I would like to see Hamas eradicated. I’m not sure that eradication is possible. And I think for people in America, certainly, and people more on the left in America, the absolutely dominant experience here is 9/11, and after 9/11, actually, there being a very similar dynamic in the conversation here, that America has lost its deterrence, that it needs to show resolve, that people are with us or against us, and a feeling, including from those of us like me, who made mistakes in what they supported or didn’t support then, that our friends who stood with us, like Tony Blair, actually enabled us in doing something terrible for us — for others too. But in many ways, I would say the US is still deformed by the mistakes we made in 9/11 and the sense that we have limits that we didn’t take seriously before. That’s why I sometimes switch between this question of destroying Hamas and degrading it, because I understand destroying it as a goal. I understand, in some ways, degrading it as more of a possibility. And I guess I would ask this, and maybe to frame it as an actual question, what do you take from the 9/11 experience.

Well, it’s interesting. I actually was in Manhattan. I was visiting the states on 9/11. And I was standing on Fifth Avenue, looking at the towers burning. And I was there in the aftermath. And I don’t like to make these comparisons. But what didn’t happen on 9/11, and what did happen here, was an intimate mass murder. The Israelis who were killed were tortured, were dismembered, were burned. It was an intimate encounter. And the horror of that, especially when you’re dealing with the Jewish psyche, is simply overwhelming. And the other piece, of course, is that Al Qaeda wasn’t sitting in New Jersey. It’s also the geographical intimacy of Oct. 7. So I do take the 9/11 precedent and the American failure seriously. I think that Israel needs to listen to those warnings. But also, those who admonish us also need to understand the limits of historical relevance here. And I don’t quite know what to compare this to. And an unprecedented attack requires an unprecedented response. And you’re right, Hamas is an idea. We won’t uproot Hamas. But ISIS is also an idea. ISIS wasn’t destroyed. But I would say that it wasn’t simply degraded either. In other words, maybe there’s some point between degraded and destroyed that we need to take more seriously.

Right after the attacks, there was a lot of global support. There was also very terrible things said in protests and on social media. But there was a lot of global support. Since, I would say, we’ve also seen true surging antisemitism all over the world. There are stories about antisemitism on the Chinese internet. And there was the mob that was roaming the airport in Dagestan, trying to find a rumored flight from Tel Aviv. And you just feel it. I live in Brooklyn. You feel it here. And I’m curious how that rise in antisemitism right now is being experienced in Israel and what it does to Israeli politics. I see it acting very powerfully on just my own Jewish community here. So I imagine it is not something — and when I read the Israeli press, it is certainly not something that is being missed. What role is that having now?

yossi klein halevi

Yeah, Israelis are very keenly following the outbreak of really, what is global antisemitism. And because of social media, we’ve never experienced antisemitism to this extent. We’ve experienced much deeper — obviously much deeper forms of antisemitism, more lethal. But there’s something about the globalization of antisemitism that’s new. What has this has done, I think, for my kid’s generation — I see it with my kids — is they always — my kids always felt that I was a paranoid Jew. Guilty as charged. And they felt — and I was very proud of them for this — they felt that they were free. They were free of those traumas. And I saw that as a tremendous success as an Israeli parent, that I’d raised Jews who were psychologically free of that trauma. And what I see with all three of them now is that it’s back. And it’s not back. It’s something they never had before. And they’re discovering vulnerability. I have two kids now living abroad. And they’re feeling this very intensely. And their generation here — this is what I’m feeling, certainly here — is that for the first time, they really understand why this place matters. And there’s a new sobriety among Israelis. And one of the things that moves me so much about what’s happening to American Jews, and certainly not all, but many, many more than I thought, is how American Jews have realized the extent to which Israel matters to them. And Oct. 7 was a glimpse that we all had into what the end of a Jewish state would look like. That’s how it ends. And suddenly, there was this sense of panic. What would happen to the Jewish people if we lost Israel? And so there’s an opportunity here. I hate to use that word in connection to this time. But this is a moment where we need to start fundamentally rethinking the dysfunctional relationship between Israel and American Jewry. We need to start taking American Jewish concerns, moral concerns, seriously. We need to consider, what does it mean — what is the impact of Israeli policies on Diaspora security? That should be an issue for us. And in turn, Diaspora Jews should be asking themselves a very hard question right now, which is, how did we allow ourselves to get to the point where we could imagine that we were ready to give up on the gift of a Jewish state? And so I think that both sides in this relationship have some really deep thinking to do. Obviously, no one is in a position to do that now. But this is a moment that I feel could be an historic turnaround finally, after 75 years, for American Jews and Israelis to start treating each other as equal Jewish grown ups who are both responsible for the future of the Jewish people.

ezra klein

I think that’s a good place to end. So this is always our final question. What are three books that you would recommend to the audience?

yossi klein halevi

The first is, I think, the best book ever written about Israel, which is “A Tale of Love and Darkness,” by Amos Oz, which is autobiographical. But it’s really the biography of the state, as he experienced it growing up. The second book I love, by Matti Friedman, “Who by Fire,” which tells the story of Leonard Cohen’s tour of the front during the Yom Kippur War. And I think anything that Matti Friedman writes, I recommend. And finally, a book called “The War of Return” by Einat Wilf and Adi Schwartz, which makes a very strong case for why the key to peace is confining the Palestinian demand for refugee return to a Palestinian state. And it lays out the history of the demand for the right of return the legal aspects. I think it’s a very important book.

ezra klein

Yossi Klein Halevi, you have many great books. But one that I read in anticipation of this, and that I would really recommend to people in this moment, is “Letters to my Palestinian Neighbor,” which is excellent. Thank you very much.

yossi klein halevi

101,101,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/world/middleeast/hezbollah-hasan-nasrallah-israel.html,"The head of Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah militia, Hassan Nasrallah, said on Saturday that his group intended to keep up pressure on Israel and claimed that it was striking deeper into Israeli territory with powerful new weapons.

Since war erupted more than a month ago between Israel and Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that controls Gaza, Israel and Hezbollah have clashed repeatedly along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran and share the goal of eradicating Israel.

But in the assessment of analysts, Israel and Hezbollah appeared to be calibrating their actions to avoid setting off what Israeli officials fear could become a broader regional war. Mr. Nasrallah has previously described Hezbollah’s objective as a controlled battle along the border aimed at sapping Israel’s morale and resources.

Mr. Nasrallah once again stopped short on Saturday of calling for an immediate, all-out regional war, echoing remarks he made in a speech last week, though he continued to dangle the threat.

For now, Hezbollah — along with militant groups from the West Bank and Yemen — will instead continue to support Hamas by keeping Israeli forces engaged on multiple fronts.

“The pressure must continue,” Mr. Nasrallah said during his televised address in Lebanon, adding that events on the battlefield would dictate whether this would grow into a bigger conflict. “We are in a battle of steadfastness and patience.”

As clashes continued along Israel’s increasingly volatile border with Lebanon, the Hezbollah leader said his group was now trying to hit targets deeper inside Israel with newer and more advanced weapons.

“There has been a quantitative improvement in terms of the number of operations and the type of weapon used,” he claimed, adding that Hezbollah for the first time had used drones and powerful new missiles and rockets — some of them containing as much as 500 kilograms of explosives — or roughly 1,100 pounds — against Israeli forces in recent days.

Hezbollah has also increasingly deployed surface-to-air missiles against Israeli drones, which have caused heavy casualties among Hezbollah fighters in recent weeks, according to the Israeli military.

In response to what the Israelis noted was an uptick in attacks by Hezbollah with more sophisticated weaponry, the Israeli military stepped up its airstrikes inside Lebanon on Friday evening, targeting Hezbollah weapons depots and intelligence infrastructure after a series of Hezbollah attacks using self-destructing drones and missiles seriously injured four Israeli soldiers.

Last week, after an Israeli drone strike killed a woman and three girls in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah also fired a barrage of Grad rockets at the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona, a first for the group since the fighting began.

102,102,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-hostages.html,"The plight of families desperately seeking the return of their loved ones abducted from Israel on Oct. 7 is painfully familiar to Aviram Shaul.

His brother, Oron Shaul, was serving in the Israeli army when he was killed in 2014, during the last major war in Gaza. Israel says Hamas still has his body, along with that of Hadar Goldin, who was killed in the same war. The group is also believed to be holding two living Israeli civilians, Avera Mengistu, who crossed into Gaza in 2014, and Hisham al-Sayed, who entered Gaza in 2015. The Israeli government has said both suffered from mental health issues before they crossed out of Israel.

“Suddenly, over 200 families have joined the battle, and it’s a surreal spectacle that you were alone, lonely — just you against the world — and suddenly, another 200 families join you,” Mr. Shaul said in a recent phone interview.

The Shaul and Goldin families are actively supporting families whose members were taken on Oct. 7. They described feelings of frustration and abandonment after years of what they saw as failed attempts to pressure the Israeli government into securing the release of Mr. Shaul and Mr. Goldin’s remains. A spokesman with the Israeli prime minister’s office declined to comment.

“Almost 10 years, we’ve been in a never-ending battle to bring him back,” Mr. Shaul said. In a separate interview, Leah Goldin, Mr. Goldin’s mother, said, “We became the face of the failure to bring our hostages home.”

For the family of Mr. Mengistu, the renewed focus on hostages has offered one small glimmer of hope that the long quest for his release might be fulfilled.

Mr. Mengistu walked into Gaza in September 2014, shortly after a cease-fire. Hamas earlier this year released a hostage video appearing to show him calling for his release, the first public evidence that he might still be alive. Hamas released a video last year of the other civilian, Mr. al-Sayed, in a bed and wearing an oxygen mask.

The family of Mr. al-Sayed didn’t respond to requests for an interview.

“The country must take advantage of the current situation — it’s an opportunity that won’t repeat itself — to return Avera and all of the brothers and sisters who are captive in Gaza,” Ilan Mengistu, Mr. Mengistu’s brother, said in an interview last week, adding, “I wish we hadn’t gotten to this situation, but there’s no doubt that it gives hope, a little bit of hope.”

He said he felt the anguish of the newer hostage families.

“As much as we’ve been in pain and suffering for almost nine years, it’s hard,” he said. “I have no words, really, on how to encourage them. It’s really hard, but you can’t lose hope.”

The Goldin and Shaul families said they have held meetings with the families of the new hostages and connected them to various governmental bodies and trauma resources. The newer hostage families have been meeting with officials in Israel and around the world, hanging up posters and putting together public displays in many cities.

Ms. Goldin said she believed that the international community must do more, adding that countries that have pushed Israel for a cease-fire should also push more actively for the release of the hostages and that any aid into Gaza should be limited until the hostages are returned.

The Goldin and Shaul families are also determined to ensure that their relatives are not left behind. Mr. Shaul, in particular, has been concerned that hostage numbers released by the Israeli military since the start of the war have not included his brother.

“It’s impossible to separate between Oron and Hadar and the rest of the civilians and soldiers who were kidnapped,” Mr. Shaul said."
103,103,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/opinion/israel-war-biden.html,"During my nine days of reporting recently in Israel and the West Bank, little did I know that the most revealing moment would come in the final hours of my visit. As I was packing to leave on Saturday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a news conference in which he indicated that Israel and the United States do not have a shared vision of how Israel should complete its war in Gaza or how to convert any Israeli victory over Hamas into a lasting peace with the Palestinians.

Without such a shared strategy, the Biden administration and the American people, particularly American Jews who support Israel, will need to make some fateful decisions.

We will have to either become captives of Netanyahu’s strategy — which could take us all down with him — or articulate an American vision for how the Gaza war must end. That would require a Biden administration plan to create two states for two indigenous peoples living in the areas of Gaza, the West Bank and Israel.

Yes, I am talking about a wartime peace plan that, if Israel agreed, could help give Israel the time, legitimacy, allies and resources it needs to defeat Hamas — without getting stuck governing all of Gaza and all of the West Bank forever, with no political horizon for the Palestinians.

And have no illusion, Netanyahu is offering only one vision right now: Seven million Jews trying to govern five million Palestinians in perpetuity — and that is a prescription for disaster for Israel, America, Jews everywhere and America’s moderate Arab allies.

The Biden plan — are you sitting down? — could actually use as one of its starting points President Donald Trump’s proposal for a two-state solution, because Netanyahu embraced that in 2020, when he had a different coalition. (Netanyahu and his ambassador in Washington practically wrote the Trump plan.) More on that in a second.

Here is why we are at a juncture that demands bold ideas, starting this past Saturday night. Speaking in Hebrew in a news conference with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Minister Benny Gantz, Netanyahu rejected U.S. and world concerns over the thousands of Palestinian lives already lost to the war to uproot Hamas from Gaza. Even more important, he declared that Israel’s military would remain in Gaza “as long as necessary” to prevent the Gaza Strip from ever again being used to launch attacks on Israeli civilians.

Gaza “will be demilitarized,” he said. “There will be no further threat from the Gaza Strip on Israel, and to ensure that, for as long as necessary, I.D.F. will control Gaza security to prevent terrorism from there,” he added, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.

Those are legitimate Israeli concerns, given the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7, but Netanyahu also indicated that Israel would oppose the return of the Palestinian Authority — Israel’s partner in the Oslo peace process that governs Palestinians in the West Bank — to Gaza after the war. The authority, Netanyahu said, is “a civil authority that educates its children to hate Israel, to kill Israelis, to eliminate the State of Israel … an authority that pays the families of murderers based on the number they murdered … an authority whose leader still has not condemned the terrible massacre 30 days later.”

Bibi — who never gives the Palestinian Authority credit for how it works every day with Israeli security officials to dampen violence in the West Bank — offered no suggestion of how and from where an alternative, legitimate Palestinian governing authority ready to work with Israel might emerge.

This was an in-your-face rebuke of the Biden administration position articulated by Secretary of State Antony Blinken last Wednesday. As The Times reported, Blinken declared during a meeting of foreign ministers in Tokyo that Gaza should be unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority once the war is over.

To retain America’s Arab and Western allies, Blinken said that right now — today — we must articulate “affirmative elements to get to a sustained peace.” And “these must include the Palestinian people’s voices and aspirations at the center of postcrisis governance in Gaza,” he said. “It must include Palestinian-led governance and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.”

My four-word translation of Blinken’s proposal to Israel: “Help us help you.”

Blinken, though, also offered no details of how that might happen. The Biden team needs to flesh that out.

Why is Netanyahu trying to destroy the Palestinian Authority as a governing option for a postwar Gaza? Because he is already campaigning to hold on to power after the Gaza war is over, and he knows there will be a huge surge of Israelis demanding he step down because of how he and his far-right cronies distracted and divided Israel and its military by pursuing a judicial coup that Israeli intelligence sources told Netanyahu was emboldening and tempting enemies such as Hamas and Hezbollah.

The only way Netanyahu can stay in power is if his far-right allies don’t abandon him, particularly Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. So to hold the support of the Jewish supremacists in his cabinet — some of whom want Israel to erect settlements in Gaza as soon as possible — Netanyahu has to declare now that the Palestinians will have no legitimate, independent representation in Gaza or the West Bank.

Yes, I know it is hard to believe, but Netanyahu is campaigning in the middle of this war.

It is time for President Biden to create a moment of truth for everyone — for Netanyahu, for the Palestinians and their supporters, for Israel and its supporters and for AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobby. Biden needs to make clear that America will not be Netanyahu’s useful idiot. We are going to lay down the principles of a fair peace plan for the morning after this war — one that reflects our interests and that will also enable us to support Israel and moderate Palestinians and win the support of moderate Arabs for an economic reconstruction of Gaza after the war.

I cannot see any major economic support for the rebuilding of Gaza coming from Europe or from countries like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia unless Israel and some legitimate Palestinian authority are committed to the principles of a peace framework to create two states for two peoples.

Biden needs to say: “Israel, we are covering your flank militarily with our two aircraft carriers, financially with $14 billion in aid and diplomatically at the U.N. The price for that is your acceptance of a peace framework based on two states for two indigenous peoples in Gaza, the West Bank and pre-1967 Israel.” This plan is based on U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, which was also the cornerstone for negotiations in the peace plan put forward by Trump in 2020.

“Bibi, do you remember what you said about that Trump plan that gave Palestinians about 70 percent of the West Bank for a state, plus an expanded Gaza Strip and a capital in the area of Jerusalem?” Biden could add. “Here’s the Associated Press story of Jan. 28, 2020, to remind you: ‘Netanyahu called it a “historic breakthrough” equal in significance to the country’s declaration of independence in 1948.’”

The Palestinian Authority foolishly rejected the Trump plan outright instead of asking to use it as a starting point. This is a chance to make up for that mistake — or be exposed as unserious.

In his valuable new book on the history of the peace process, “(In)Sights: Peacemaking in the Oslo Process Thirty Years and Counting,” Gidi Grinstein, a member of Ehud Barak’s negotiating team at Camp David, argues that the Trump plan provides a natural foundation for a revived peace process for a two-state solution.

That is not only because Netanyahu already agreed to it, Grinstein told me in an interview, even if the settler hard-liners in his cabinet did not and still would not. It’s also viable because the Trump plan was actually based on the condition that peace was possible only after Hamas was removed from power in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority could assume control of the Gaza Strip, which, the Trump plan argued, would be expanded by land carved from Israel’s Negev Desert.

Biden could also propose that with the help of our moderate Arab allies, such as the U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Bahrain, we would come up with a plan to overhaul the Palestinian Authority, purge its education system of anti-Israel material, upgrade its forces that work daily with Israeli security teams in the West Bank and phase out its financial support for Palestinian prisoners who harmed Israelis.

Is the Palestinian Authority up to such a deal? Are progressive Palestinian supporters in the West who chant the eliminationist mantra “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” up for it? Will Israel’s silent majority be if Hamas is defeated?

Let’s see what they all really stand for — or if they have a better answer — because neither is going to disappear. Biden needs to put them all to the test.

I know that a lot of American Jewish leaders privately would love Biden to put forward such a plan, but so far only one, Ronald Lauder, a longtime Republican and the president of the World Jewish Congress, has had the courage to call for it — in a Saudi newspaper, no less, in an essay titled, “A Time for Peace and a Two-State Solution.” As he explained, “Only a two-state solution would guarantee Israelis and Palestinians a life in dignity, safety and with a better perspective on the economic situation, which would lead to a sustainable future.”

Such a plan would protect America’s interests and make clear that we care about what’s best for Israelis and Palestinians and our allies in the region, not what’s best for Bibi’s political future — which several Israeli analysts told me would be to drag out the war, so he couldn’t be ousted by mass demonstrations, or to drag us into a conflict with Iran in hopes that it would overshadow all his mistakes.

If a two-state plan was embraced by Israel, even with reservations, it would reinforce for the world that Israel sees its war in Gaza as one of necessary self-defense and a prelude to lasting peace. And if such a plan was embraced by the Palestinian Authority, even with reservations, that would reinforce that the authority intends to be the alternative to Hamas in shaping an independent future for Palestinians alongside Israel — and that it will not be a bystander to Hamas’s madness or a victim of it."
104,104,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/books/israel-gaza-war-national-book-awards.html,"As the cultural fallout from the war in the Middle East continues, several finalists for the National Book Award plan to call for a cease-fire in Gaza during the ceremony on Wednesday. Two sponsors have decided not to attend the ceremony after learning authors were planning a political statement.

“I don’t want to look back on this time,” said Aaliyah Bilal, a finalist in the fiction category and one of the authors planning to speak out, “and say that I was silent while people were suffering.”

Rumors that authors would take a stand regarding the Israel-Gaza conflict during the ceremony were flying in the days leading up to the event, but it was unclear what the statement would include, leaving several sponsors concerned.

One of the sponsors that withdrew after learning that some authors were planning a political statement was Zibby Media. Zibby Owens, the company’s founder, wrote in an essay published on Substack that her company had withdrawn because she was afraid the remarks at the ceremony would take a stance against Israel, noting that “we simply can’t be a part of anything that promotes discrimination, in this case of Israel and the Jewish people.”

Another sponsor, Book of the Month, has also decided not to attend. In a statement, the organization said it continued to support the event.

On Tuesday, the National Book Foundation sent a message to all the sponsors and those who purchased tickets, alerting them to the likelihood that winners were planning to issue political statements from the podium. The letter said that one group had decided to withdraw its sponsorship altogether.

“This is by no means unprecedented in the history of the National Book Awards, or indeed any awards ceremony, but given the extraordinarily painful moment we are in, we felt it best to reach out in case you have any questions or concerns,” wrote Ruth Dickey, the executive director of the foundation.

Bilal said that a number of finalists are planning to take the stage at the end of the ceremony as one person reads the statement. In framing the call for a cease-fire, she said, she and other writers want to demonstrate sensitivity to losses on all sides and intend to specifically denounce antisemitism.

“It was very important, as we were constructing it, that we were clear that we are sensitive to all of the antisemitism going on in this moment,” Bilal said of the statement. “We don’t want to contribute to inflaming that.”

It’s not the first time that politics have taken center stage at the National Book Awards. In 2016, the award ceremony took place shortly after Donald Trump was elected president. Many of the winners spoke about the challenges of living in politically and culturally polarizing times, and some, including the fiction winner Colson Whitehead, directly criticized Trump, referring to the “blasted hellhole wasteland of Trumpland.”

In recent years, authors have also given pointed speeches that address racism and the treatment of migrants in the United States, and the lack of diversity in the publishing industry.

The literary world tends to be politically liberal, and in the past has often been aligned on issues like immigration and racial equality. But the current conflict in Israel and Gaza has proved polarizing.

Last month, the 92NY, one of New York’s leading cultural institutions, faced a backlash over its decision to call off an appearance by the novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen after he signed an open letter criticizing Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. In response, other writers, including the poet Paisley Rekdal and the critic Andrea Long Chu, pulled out of scheduled events at 92NY, and some staff members resigned. Other events featuring Palestinian artists and writers have been canceled, including at the Frankfurt Book Fair, leading some literary figures to warn against censoring Palestinian voices.

The National Book Awards, now in its 74th year, is one of the most prestigious literary prizes in the country. This year’s ceremony, hosted by LeVar Burton, an actor and literacy advocate, is set to take place on Nov. 15 in New York. The event typically draws some 700 people, and awards are presented in five categories: fiction, nonfiction, poetry, translated literature and young people’s literature."
105,105,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hamas-photographers.html,"The Israeli government on Thursday accused freelance photographers for several major news organizations, including The New York Times, of being “accomplices” in the killing and abductions of Israeli soldiers and civilians by Hamas fighters — an allegation The Times vigorously denied about its freelancer.

The government seized on a report by a pro-Israel media watchdog group, Honest Reporting, which has long accused The Times and other news organizations of anti-Israel bias in their coverage of Israel’s conflict with the Palestinians.

“These journalists were accomplices in crimes against humanity,” the public diplomacy department of the prime minister’s office said in a tersely worded statement. “Their actions were contrary to professional ethics.”

In its report, the watchdog group questioned why six Gaza-based photographers, all of whom were working for The Associated Press and Reuters, were early to document the incursion by Hamas into Israel on Oct. 7. The journalists photographed an Israeli tank that had been destroyed at the border of the Gaza Strip, soon after the militants broke through a fence and swarmed into Israeli territory.

It said one of the photographers, Hassan Eslaiah, took pictures of a house burning in Kibbutz Kfar Azza, a target of the deadly attack by militants, while two others documented Hamas fighters transporting kidnapped Israelis back to Gaza. These harrowing images were all published by The Associated Press, as was a Reuters photo of a mob carrying the body of an Israeli soldier.

While a fourth A.P. photographer named in the report, Yousef Masoud, has worked as a freelancer for The Times since shortly after the war began, he was not on assignment for the paper on the morning of Oct. 7, according to a statement issued by The Times. The Times rejected suggestions that it had advance warning of the attacks or had accompanied Hamas terrorists, calling the claims “untrue and outrageous.” It also said there was “no evidence for Honest Reporting’s insinuations” about Mr. Masoud.

“It is reckless to make those allegations, putting our journalists on the ground in Israel and Gaza at risk,” the statement said. “The Times has extensively covered the Oct. 7 attacks and the war with fairness, impartiality, and an abiding understanding of the complexities of the conflict.”

The Times said it had reviewed Mr. Masoud’s work for The Associated Press on Oct. 7 and determined that “he was doing what photojournalists always do during major news events, documenting the tragedy as it unfolded.”

In its review of Mr. Masoud’s work, editors at The Times determined that the first photo he transmitted to the A.P. — of the destroyed Israeli tank — was taken more than 90 minutes after the attack began, according to an editor at The Times who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an internal matter. Mr. Masoud told his editors, this person said, that he was woken at home in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, by the sound of rocket fire, shortly after 6:30 a.m. on Saturday morning.

Mr. Masoud said he later made his way to the border, where he saw the fence had been breached and that an Israeli tank had been destroyed. He told Times editors, the person said, that he did not linger in Israel and did not photograph abductees or acts of brutality by Hamas fighters.

The furor over the Gaza photographers is part of a broader information war that has raged alongside the actual war. Claims and counterclaims, often based on doctored images or disinformation, pop up daily on social media sites, with a goal of tilting the public narrative in one direction or the other.

A claim by Hamas last month that an Israeli military strike hit the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, killing 500 people, was reported by The Times, BBC, CNN and other news organizations. Israeli and American intelligence agencies later contended that the explosion had been caused by a wayward Palestinian rocket.

An added challenge for Western news organizations in covering the war is that their staff correspondents and photographers have very limited access to Gaza. Israel has prevented journalists from entering the territory except when accompanied by its military, and Egypt has also blocked access. Hamas, which controls Gaza, places sweeping restrictions on what reporters can cover. As a result, most outlets rely on local reporters and photographers who live in the enclave.

Honest Reporting said it stood by its reporting. “If The New York Times can defend the right of photojournalists to document the atrocities of Oct. 7,” it said in a statement, “as a media watchdog, we have a responsibility to question the role played by the photographers that day.”

The Associated Press said it, too, had no advance knowledge of the attack. But it said in a statement that it was no longer working with Mr. Eslaiah, who filed the earliest and most extensive photos of the attack.

There were other red flags about Mr. Eslaiah. He posed for a picture being kissed by Yahya Sinwar, a Hamas leader who masterminded the attack. Amit Segal, an Israeli journalist, posted video on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he claimed showed Mr. Eslaiah riding in Israel on a motorcycle while carrying a hand grenade.

Mr. Eslaiah confirmed in an interview that he had been given a ride back to Gaza from Israel but said he was not the person carrying the grenade. He said he had no advance knowledge of the attack and had no links to Hamas, despite the photo with Mr. Sinwar. “I am very worried and scared,” he said.

Mr. Eslaiah suggested there was a double standard, noting that Israeli journalists had accompanied the Israel Defense Forces into Gaza to cover their ground operation. “Why are we not allowed, and they are allowed?” he said.

In a statement, CNN, which has also employed Mr. Eslaiah, said, “While we have not at this time found reason to doubt the journalistic accuracy of the work he has done for us, we have decided to suspend all ties with him.”

Similarly, Reuters said it “categorically denies that it had prior knowledge of the attack or that we embedded journalists with Hamas on Oct. 7.”

The news agency said that it acquired the photos from two Gaza-based photographers, with whom it did not have a prior relationship, and that they had been taken “two hours after Hamas fired rockets over southern Israel and more than 45 minutes after Israel said gunmen had crossed the border.”

It is not the first time that Honest Reporting has raised questions about a freelance employee of The Times from Gaza. Soliman Hijjy, a freelance filmmaker who recently contributed a video report on the bombing of Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, came under criticism for a post on Facebook in 2012 in which he shared a meme that appeared to praise Adolf Hitler.

The Times declined to discuss his case, citing several issues, including safety concerns. In a statement to Honest Reporting last month, the paper said that in 2022 it had discussed this and other “problematic” social media posts with Mr. Hijjy, and that he had pledged to adhere to the paper’s standards. The Times said he had done so, delivering “important and impartial work at great personal risk in Gaza during this conflict.”

The swimmers on the team follow one another on Instagram, and Avishag recalled being shocked when she spotted the posts. She immediately called Shira Chuna, a 16-year-old teammate, to express her outrage, although she didn’t tell her parents or anyone else.

Then she texted Mustafa in an exchange that she later shared with The New York Times.

“What???,” she asked. “With all the respect, that’s not true.”

He said, “Always we are wrong and always you are the right.”

“That’s not what I said,” Avishag responded. “Right now Hamas are in the wrong.”

She told him to tell her if he wanted the videos. She wanted to prove her point, but also to preserve their friendship. She texted him, “I have to ask if we are cool?”

He placed a heart on her message and typed “yes” in Spanish. She hearted his message, too. It seemed they had achieved an uneasy peace, although they couldn’t be sure until they swam together again."

Since then, I have witnessed the city as its architecture and population changed. I saw the city coping with loss and recorded scenes at ground zero in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks. And now I have seen the new trauma of a city divided.

As October turned into November, Times Opinion asked me to explore the city looking for the reverberations of the war between Israel and Gaza through protests and other visual clues. The idea was to document the impact in New York of a war over 5,000 miles away. I recorded observations and moments of anger, fear and hope over 10 days. What became clear over and over was that, to many New Yorkers, the war feels extremely close to home.

My drawings were made on the spot and depict a spectrum of positions and actions. With all the uncertainty and volatility that this war has brought, these drawings are snapshots of moments when no one view speaks for everyone."
109,109,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/us/politics/israel-al-shifa-hospital-hamas-evidence.html,"Israel is trying to produce solid evidence for its assertion that Hamas has been using tunnels under Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza as a command center. But an Israeli military-led tour of the hospital grounds with journalists Thursday night showed directly only a shaft in the ground with a staircase, which did not settle the issue.

A definitive answer is almost certain not to come overnight, military experts said.

What is the evidence so far?

Both Israel and the Biden administration say they have evidence that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad are operating command centers and ammunition depots under hospitals in Gaza, as part of an effort to turn civilians using the hospitals into human shields.

Thursday night’s Israeli military tour showed that the shaft had electrical wiring, along with a metal staircase. In the darkness, it was unclear where the shaft led or how deep it went. The military said it had sent a drone down at least several meters into the shaft, which it said was found in the sand on the northern perimeter of the hospital complex.

Israel has also released a pair of videos from inside Gaza’s main children’s hospital that Israel said showed weapons and explosives found in the medical center, and a room where the military said hostages were kept. The videos contain a series of assertions that could not be independently verified.

The Israeli military said that soldiers had also found weapons at Al-Shifa and had recovered the bodies of two Israelis taken hostage in locations adjacent to the hospital.

Palestinian officials and doctors at Al-Shifa have denied that the hospital has been used by Hamas’s military.

American officials said this week that they have intelligence, separate from Israeli intelligence, that confirms that Hamas is operating command centers and ammunitions depots under hospitals. One official said that the intelligence is based on intercepts from fighters.

But the sensitive nature of the intelligence means that American officials have not described exactly what the intercepted communications say. Nor have they shown the intercepts to journalists.

How much time could it take for Israel to provide a conclusive account?

It could take weeks, months, or could never come, American military officials said on Friday.

American and Israeli officials said that many of the tunnels could be booby-trapped with bombs either remotely triggered or set to explode when something crosses a tripwire. In 2013, six Israeli soldiers were wounded, and one was blinded, when a booby trap exploded as they tried to shove a camera into a Hamas tunnel.

Whether this is the case under Al-Shifa Hospital or not, Israeli forces will view sending soldiers down into the tunnels as a measure of last resort, one Pentagon official said Friday.

Col. Elad Tsury, commander of Israel’s Seventh Brigade, said it might be days before troops descended into the shaft.

Pentagon officials privately said there was frustration that Israel did not take more time to plan the Gaza invasion, which could have allowed the Israeli Defense Forces to evacuate civilians. The lead-up to the American and Iraqi fight to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul from the Islamic State in 2016, American officials said, took nine months, in part so that officials could work out how to limit civilian casualties.

By going in with no strategy for how they would minimize civilian casualties, one senior U.S. official said, Israel put itself in the position of trying to justify the high civilian death toll by proving that Hamas was using the hospital as a command center. That puts pressure on Israel, the official said, to make a case that could take months.

What is the wider significance of the hospital dispute?

Israel and Hamas are not just in a physical war — which Israelis say killed 1,200 Israelis in Hamas’s brutal Oct. 7 attack, and which the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says has killed 11,000 Palestinians. The two sides are also in a war for global public opinion. That second war has put Israel under pressure.

A big part of the Israeli narrative is that Hamas is operating command headquarters under hospitals — essentially making human shields out of civilians, a war crime. But targeting a hospital is also a war crime in most circumstances.

So both sides are trying to show the other to be culpable in putting civilians at risk. Global opinion has shifted against Israel as the Palestinian death toll has gone up.

Critics of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say the Israeli government has been too expansive in its argument about human shields, since there are believed to be hundreds of tunnels all over Gaza, not just under the hospital.

“The notion of human shields, when applied so broadly, allows Israel to pre-emptively say everything is a legitimate target,” said Daniel Levy, a former Israeli peace negotiator who is now president of the U.S. Middle East Project, a policy institute.

How many miles of tunnels are there under Gaza?

No one knows for sure. One U.S. official likened the tunnel network under Gaza to “miniature cities,” with subterranean pathways, rooms, cells and even roads for vehicles.

Hamas has spent years refining its tunnel network underneath the tiny coastal strip of more than two million people. Tunnels have been a part of life in Gaza for years, but they sharply multiplied after 2007, when Hamas took control of the enclave and Israel tightened a blockade of the territory. Palestinians responded by building hundreds of tunnels to smuggle in food, goods, people and weapons.

Some analysts have put the number of miles of tunnels in the hundreds. Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, said in 2021 that there were 310 miles of tunnels in Gaza.

In 2018, the Israel Defense Forces destroyed a tunnel that was more than a mile long.

What would it take to clear the tunnels?

One American military official said that it would likely take years for Israel to clear all of the Gaza tunnels.

Would you consider a humanitarian pause, for example?” “The first thing I said to him when it happened was I said, ‘Finish them. Finish them.’ And the reason is I worked on this every day when I was at the United Nations. And we have to remember that they have to, one, eliminate Hamas; two, support Israel with whatever they need, whenever they need it; and three, make sure we bring our hostages home. We need to be very clear-eyed to know there would be no Hamas without Iran. There would be no Hezbollah without Iran. There would not be the Houthis without Iran. And there wouldn’t be the Iranian militias in Syria and Iraq that are trying to hit our military men and women, if it hadn’t been for Iran.”"
111,111,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-security-hamas.html,"By saying that Israel will maintain security control over Gaza “for an indefinite period,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set off alarm bells in Washington and questions at home.

The Biden administration, trying to manage severe criticism among Arab and European allies about the death toll in Gaza — now at more than 10,000 Gazan officials say — was quick to push back.

“We’re very clear on no reoccupation, just as we’re very clear on no displacement of the Palestinian population,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in Tokyo on Wednesday.

Mr. Blinken did leave open the possibility of a “transition period” after the war ends, he said, but eventually Gaza’s administration “must include Palestinian-led governance and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.”

But everyone is vague on how that might happen, given the current weakness of President Mahmoud Abbas’s Palestinian Authority, which is limited to parts of the occupied West Bank. Mr. Abbas is deeply unpopular, and the Authority is widely criticized among Palestinians for corruption and its collaboration with Israel. That collaboration helps Mr. Abbas tamp down dissent in the West Bank, including from members of Hamas, while Israeli settlements continue to expand there.

So, in a real sense, Mr. Netanyahu was just saying the obvious.

After the killing of so many Israelis by Hamas a month ago — about 1,400, officials say — Israel will want to ensure its own security so that such an invasion from Gaza can never happen again. The presumption is that Israel will control Gaza until some new arrangement can be made to govern the strip and patrol it, which could take a long time.

Even then, it is highly unlikely, Israeli officials say, that Israel will ever completely trust any Palestinian or even international peacekeeping force to keep Israel safe."
112,112,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/opinion/israel-hamas-war.html,"People warned me before I came to Tel Aviv a few days ago that the Israel of Oct. 7 is an Israel that I’ve never been to before. They were right. It is a place in which Israelis have never lived before, a nation that Israeli generals have never had to protect before, an ally that America has never had to defend before — certainly not with the urgency and resolve that would lead a U.S. president to fly over and buck up the whole nation.

After traveling around Israel and the West Bank, I now understand why so much has changed. It is crystal clear to me that Israel is in real danger — more danger than at any other time since its War of Independence in 1948. And it’s for three key reasons:

First, Israel is facing threats from a set of enemies who combine medieval theocratic worldviews with 21st-century weaponry — and are no longer organized as small bands of militiamen but as modern armies with brigades, battalions, cybercapabilities, long-range rockets, drones and technical support. I am speaking about Iranian-backed Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic militias in Iraq and the Houthis in Yemen — and now even the openly Hamas-embracing Vladimir Putin. These foes have long been there, but all of them seemed to surface together like dragons during this conflict, threatening Israel with a 360-degree war all at once.

How does a modern democracy live with such a threat? This is exactly the question these demonic forces wanted to instill in the mind of every Israeli. They are not seeking a territorial compromise with the Jewish state. Their goal is to collapse the confidence of Israelis that their defense and intelligence services can protect them from surprise attacks across their borders — so Israelis will, first, move away from the border regions and then they will move out of the country altogether.

I am stunned by how many Israelis now feel this danger personally, no matter where they live — starting with a friend who lives in Jerusalem telling me that she and her husband just got gun licenses to have pistols at home. No one is going to snatch their children and take them into a tunnel. Hamas, alas, has tunneled fear into many, many Israeli heads far from the Gaza border.

The second danger I see is that the only conceivable way that Israel can generate the legitimacy, resources, time and allies to fight such a difficult war with so many enemies is if it has unwavering partners abroad, led by the United States. President Biden, quite heroically, has been trying to help Israel with its immediate and legitimate goal of dismantling Hamas’s messianic terrorist regime in Gaza — which is as much a threat to the future of Israel as it is to Palestinians longing for a decent state of their own in Gaza or the West Bank.

But Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza entails urban, house-to-house fighting that creates thousands of civilian casualties — innocent men, women and children — among whom Hamas deliberately embedded itself to force Israel to have to kill those innocents in order to kill the Hamas leadership and uproot its miles of attack tunnels.

But Biden can sustainably generate the support Israel needs only if Israel is ready to engage in some kind of a wartime diplomatic initiative directed at the Palestinians in the West Bank — and hopefully in a post-Hamas Gaza — that indicates Israel will discuss some kind of two-state solutions if Palestinian officials can get their political house unified and in order.

This leads directly to my third, deep concern.

Israel has the worst leader in its history — maybe in all of Jewish history — who has no will or ability to produce such an initiative.

Worse, I am stunned by the degree to which that leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, continues to put the interests of holding on to the support of his far-right base — and pre-emptively blaming Israel’s security and intelligence services for the war — ahead of maintaining national solidarity or doing some of the basic things that Biden needs in order to get Israel the resources, allies, time and legitimacy it needs to defeat Hamas.

Biden cannot help Israel build a coalition of U.S., European and moderate Arab partners to defeat Hamas if Netanyahu’s message to the world remains, in effect: “Help us defeat Hamas in Gaza while we work to expand settlements, annex the West Bank and build a Jewish supremacist state there.”

Let’s drill down on these dangers.

Last Saturday night, a retired Israeli Army commander stopped by my hotel in Tel Aviv to share his perspective on the war. I took him to the 18th-floor executive lounge for our chat, and when we got into the elevator to go up, we joined a family of four — two parents, a toddler and a baby in a stroller. The Israeli general asked them where they were from. “Kiryat Shmona,” the father answered.

As we stepped out, I joked with the general that he could dispense with his briefing. It took just 18 floors and those two words — “Kiryat Shmona” — to describe Israel’s wickedly complex new strategic dilemma created by the surprise Hamas attack of Oct. 7.

Kiryat Shmona is one of the most important Israeli towns on the border with Lebanon. That father said his family had fled the northern fence line with thousands of other Israeli families after the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia and Palestinian militias in southern Lebanon began lobbing rockets and artillery and making incursions in solidarity with Hamas.

When might they go back? They had no idea. Like more than 200,000 other Israelis, they have taken refuge with friends or in hotels all across this small country of nine million people. And it has taken only a few weeks for Israelis to begin driving up real estate prices in seemingly safer central Israeli towns. For Hezbollah, that alone is mission accomplished, without even invading like Hamas. Together, Hezbollah and Hamas are managing to shrink Israel.

On Sunday I drove down to a hotel on the Dead Sea to meet some of the hundreds of surviving members of Kibbutz Be’eri, which had some 1,200 residents, including 360 children. It was one of the communities hardest hit by the Hamas onslaught — suffering more than 130 murders in addition to scores of injured and multiple kidnappings of children and elderly. The Israeli government has moved most survivors of the kibbutz across the country to the Dead Sea, where they are now starting their own schools in a hotel ballroom.

I asked Liat Admati, 35, a survivor of the Hamas attack who ran a clinic for facial cosmetics for 11 years in Be’eri, what would make it possible for her to go back to her Gaza border home, where she was raised.

“The main thing for me to go back is to feel safe,” she said. “Before this situation, I felt I have trust in the army. Now I feel the trust is broken. I don’t want to feel that we are covering ourselves in walls and shelters all the time while behind this fence there are people who can one day do this again. I really don’t know at this point what the solution is.”

Before Oct. 7, she and her neighbors thought the threat was rockets, she said, so they built safe rooms, but now that Hamas gunmen came over and burned parents and kids in their safe rooms, who knows what is safe? “The safe room was designed to keep you safe from rockets, not from another human who would come and kill you for who you are,"" she said. What is most dispiriting, she concluded, is that it appears that some Gazans who worked on the kibbutz gave Hamas maps of the layout.

There are a lot of Israelis who listened to the recording, published by The Times of Israel, of a Hamas gunman who took part in the Oct. 7 onslaught, identified by his father as Mahmoud, calling his parents from the phone of a Jewish woman he’d just murdered and imploring them to check his WhatsApp messages to see the pictures he took of some of the 10 Jews he alone killed in Mefalsim, a kibbutz near the Gaza border.

“Look how many I killed with my own hands! Your son killed Jews,” he says, according to an English translation. “Mom, your son is a hero,” he adds. His parents can be heard seemingly rejoicing.

This kind of chilling exuberance — Israel was built so that such a thing could never happen — explains the homemade sign I saw on a sidewalk while driving through the French Hill Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem the other day: “It’s either us or them.’’

The euphoric rampage of Oct. 7 that killed some 1,400 soldiers and civilians has not only hardened Israeli hearts toward the suffering of Gaza civilians. It has also inflicted a deep sense of humiliation and guilt on the Israeli Army and defense establishment, for having failed in their most basic mission of protecting the country’s borders.

As a result, there is a conviction in the army that it must demonstrate to the entire neighborhood — to Hezbollah in Lebanon, to the Houthis in Yemen, to the Islamic militias in Iraq, to the Hamas and other fighters in the West Bank — that it will stop at nothing to re-establish the security of the borders. While the army insists that it is hewing to the laws of war, it wants to show that no one can outcrazy Israel to drive its people from this region — even if the Israeli military has to defy the U.S. and even if it does not have any solid plan for governing Gaza the morning after the war.

As Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, told reporters on Wednesday: “Israel cannot accept such an active threat on its borders. The whole idea of people living side by side in the Middle East was jeopardized by Hamas.”

This conflict is now back to its most biblical and primordial roots. This seems to be a time of eyes for eyes and teeth for teeth. The morning-after policy thinking will have to wait for the mourning after.

Which is why I so worry about the leadership here today. I was traveling around the West Bank on Tuesday when I heard that Netanyahu had just told ABC News that Israel plans to retain “overall security responsibility” in Gaza “for an indefinite period” after its war with Hamas.

Really? Consider this context: “According to Israel’s official Central Bureau of Statistics, at the end of 2021, 9.449 million people live in Israel (including Israelis in West Bank settlements), the Times of Israel reported last year. “Of those, 6.982 million (74 percent) are Jewish, 1.99 million (21 percent) are Arab, and 472,000 (5 percent) are neither. The Palestinian Bureau of Statistics puts the West Bank Palestinian population at a little over three million and the Gaza population at just over two million.”

So Netanyahu is saying that seven million Jews are going to indefinitely control the lives of five million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza — while offering them no political horizon, nothing, by way of statehood one day on any demilitarized conditions.

Early on the morning of Oct. 29, as the Israeli Army was just moving into Gaza, Netanyahu posted and then deleted a message on social media in which he blamed Israel’s defense and intelligence establishment for failing to anticipate Hamas’s surprise attack. (Netanyahu somehow forgot how often the Israeli military and intelligence leaders had warned him that his totally unnecessary coup against the country’s judicial system was fracturing the army and Israel’s enemies were all noticing its vulnerability.)

After being slammed by the public for digitally stabbing his army and intelligence chiefs in the back in the middle of a war, Netanyahu published a new post. “I was wrong,” he wrote, adding that “the things I said following the press conference should not have been said, and I apologize for that. I fully support the heads of [Israel’s] security services.”

But the damage was done. How much do you suppose those military leaders trust what Netanyahu will say if the Gaza campaign stalls? What real leader would behave that way at the start of a war of survival?

Let me not mince words, because the hour is dark and Israel, as I said, is in real danger. Netanyahu and his far-right zealots have taken Israel on multiple flights of fancy in the last year: dividing the country and the army over the fraudulent judicial reform, bankrupting its future with massive investments in religious schools that teach no math and in West Bank Jewish settlements that teach no pluralism — while building up Hamas, which would never be a partner for peace, and tearing down the Palestinian Authority, the only possible partner for peace.

The sooner Israel replaces Netanyahu and his far-right allies with a true center-left-center-right national unity government, the better chance it has to hold together during what is going to be a hellish war and aftermath. And the better chance that Biden — who may be down in the polls in America but could get elected here in a landslide for the empathy and steel he showed at Israel’s hour of need — will not have hitched his credibility and ours to a Netanyahu Israel that will never be able to fully help us to help it.

This society is so much better than its leader. It is too bad it took a war to drive that home. Ron Scherf is a retired member of Israel’s most elite special forces unit and a founder of Brothers in Arms, the Israeli activist coalition that mobilized veterans and reservists to oppose Netanyahu’s judicial coup. Immediately after the Hamas invasion, Brothers in Arms pivoted to organizing reservists and aid workers to get to the front — left, right, religious, secular, it didn’t matter — many hours before this incompetent government did.

It’s a remarkable story of grass-roots mobilization that showed how much solidarity is still buried in this place and could be unlocked by a different prime minister, one who was a uniter, not a divider. Or as Scherf put it to me, “When you go to the front, you are overwhelmed by the power of what we lost.”"

His rabbi suggested he join the trip to New York. In Queens on Monday night, Mr. Ariev held in his hands a piece of paper scrawled with yet another prayer. “Now we can ask from the other side of the world for the same thing,” he said.

The Lubavitchers follow a strict form of Orthodoxy, but many of the people who made the trip were far less religious. In Israel, Chabad — which is known for its open-house-style synagogues and social services — is seen as something of a bridge between more secular Jews and other denominations. After more than five weeks of no word on most of the hostages’ fates, the journey was a mission for some Israelis, a pilgrimage for others. Some said it was a way to combat a feeling of powerlessness.

“I want all the world to know how far I will go to bring my children back home,” said Mirit Regev, 50. Her 18-year-old son, Itay, and her daughter, Maya, 21, were kidnapped from a music festival in the south of the country. Ms. Regev said that Itay was later seen bound in a Hamas video and that Maya’s cellphone was located miles away in Gaza. “I am in hell,” she said.

At Montefiore Cemetery that night, few wanted to discuss what had transpired since the people they loved were captured. Israel has said an estimated 1,200 people were killed in the Oct. 7 attack. Gaza health officials, who are part of the Hamas government, say more than 11,000 people have been killed in the Palestinian enclave since the war began. Many of the families at the shrine said they planned to head on to a rally in support of Israel in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday.

Shira Soussana said she and her family had always leaned left politically and called for peaceful coexistence. Then her sister Amit, 40, was kidnapped from a kibbutz about three miles east of Gaza. “After this happened, it makes us feel insecure; we don’t have a belief anymore in people, it’s so evil,” she said, adding, “on both sides.”"

I would say to President Biden, diplomacy only is a weak strategy. Appeasement leads to war."
115,115,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostages.html,"Days before Israel launched its ground invasion of Gaza, it was closing in on a deal for Hamas to release up to 50 hostages in exchange for pausing the bombardment unleashed in response to the militants’ Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, according to Arab and Western officials with knowledge of the talks.

But once Israel’s ground assault on Gaza got underway on Oct. 27, the negotiations came to an abrupt halt, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. The talks resumed days later and are still underway.

Israel had delayed its ground attack to give some time for the hostage negotiations to be completed, according to two of the officials. But as the talks stalled, it decided to go forward, reckoning that Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that rules Gaza, would bow to military pressure.

“There will be no pause without the return of hostages and missing persons,” Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said in a written statement to The New York Times this week. “The only way of saving the hostages is if Israel continues its ground operation.”"
116,116,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/us/politics/senate-democrats-biden-israel.html,"The Republican-led House last week approved the money for Israel, but that bill is dead on arrival in the Senate because it includes domestic spending cuts and omits help for Ukraine. The Senate has not yet taken up an alternative.

The senators did not threaten to withhold their support for aid to Israel, but their pointed requests for more information and accountability over the weapons they will be asked to approve were further evidence of a shift in tone among Democrats on the war. It has paralleled one by Mr. Biden himself, who has become more critical of Israel’s war campaign, which has brought on a humanitarian crisis. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 10,000 people have been killed.

The senators drew a distinction between defensive aid for Israel, for which they expressed unequivocal support, and military assistance that would go toward furthering Israel’s assault on the Gaza Strip, about which they raised significant questions.

“We believe the United States should immediately provide Israel with the funding it needs to replenish its defensive systems, including Iron Dome and other air defense capabilities,” the group wrote. “But to better understand the efficacy of U.S. funding that supports Israel’s operations inside Gaza, we respectfully ask your team to provide us with information relative to these two clear U.S. priorities: supporting an Israeli strategy that will effectively degrade and defeat the threat from Hamas and taking all possible measures to protect civilians in Gaza.”

The senators said that they were invested in Israel’s success, and that their concerns were rooted in a desire to see Israel avoid the sort of strategic blunders that might worsen its long-term security.

“The attacks of Oct. 7 brought back chilling memories of the United States’ own confrontation with terror 22 years ago,” they wrote. They encouraged Israel to “learn from the mistakes the United States made in our fight against terrorism by focusing on realistic and achievable military goals, and abide by the laws of war, including the protection of civilians.”

The Senate Democrats’ letter also comes amid mounting pressure from the party’s left wing, where lawmakers and activists have been agitating for a cease-fire and condemning Mr. Biden for abetting what they charge is a genocide of Palestinians. Genocide is defined under international law as a crime committed with the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, whether in wartime or peacetime. Israel’s leaders have said they are targeting Hamas, not Palestinian civilians.

The House on Tuesday night censured Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan and the only Palestinian American in Congress, for her harsh criticism of Israel and suggestion that its policies prompted the Hamas attack as well as her embrace of a pro-Palestinian slogan that many regard as calling for the destruction of Israel. She used the debate of the resolution to plead for sympathy for the plight of the Palestinian people.

In the letter, Senate Democrats asked for information about “what specific mechanisms you are putting in place to ensure that Israeli military operations conducted inside Gaza are carried out in accordance with international humanitarian law and to ensure that any U.S.-provided equipment is used in a manner consistent with U.S. law.” They specifically requested an assessment of whether Israel’s military rules of engagement, particularly regarding mitigating civilian casualties, are in line with U.S. policy and practice.

White House officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the letter.

Mr. Biden and his top deputies have repeatedly stated that the United States stands shoulder to shoulder with Israel as it tries to eradicate the threat from Hamas. But in recent weeks, he and top administration officials have spent ample time stressing the importance of protecting Palestinian civilians caught in the crossfire, urging Israeli leaders to commit to humanitarian pauses in order to facilitate deliveries of food, water and fuel to beleaguered Gaza residents prohibited from leaving the strip to escape the fighting.

Many of the letter’s signatories have been vocal about urging the administration to prioritize the protection of Palestinian civilians, both in Gaza and the West Bank, where dozens have been killed by settler violence since the start of the war. In the letter, they asked Mr. Biden to obtain public assurances from both Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president with authority over the West Bank, to quell violent attacks against each other’s people.

The signatories are a cross-section of Senate Democrats who have taken varying positions on the conflict in recent days. Mr. Durbin is the only one who has endorsed calls for a cease-fire under certain conditions, including Hamas first agreeing to release all hostages in its custody. Also signing on to the letter were two independent senators, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine."

By Israel’s account, Al Shifa — the name of the hospital — has become shorthand for Hamas’ willingness to turn its own people into human shields and sacrifice them as cannon fodder in the fight for global sympathy.

The militants, Israeli security officials say, have spent the better part of 16 years building a vast command complex under the hospital, and setting up similar bases underneath other medical facilities in the enclave. American officials agree, citing their own intelligence.

Hamas denies doing anything of the sort, and hospital officials say the facility houses nothing but the sick and injured and the medical professionals dedicated to helping them. In the estimation of most Palestinians, the obsession with Al Shifa is evidence of Israel’s willingness to target even the most helpless civilians without justification.

The hospital’s director, Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, flatly described the Israeli allegations as “untrue” in an interview on Friday.

While it is impossible to independently verify many of the assertions of either side, the competing claims are likely to be tested soon. The hospital, Israeli officials said, was spared in past Israeli operations out of concern for civilian life, but at the cost of leaving whatever may be underneath it intact."

“Israel will — for an indefinite period — will have the overall security responsibility because we’ve seen what happens when we don’t have it,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “When we don’t have that security responsibility, what we have is the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we couldn’t imagine.”

His comments were quickly endorsed by others in Israel, including the opposition leader, Yair Lapid, who suggested that Israel did not want to govern Gaza. Israeli forces previously withdrew from the territory in 2005, and President Biden has warned that it would be “a big mistake” for them to reoccupy it.

Mr. Netanyahu’s comments came as Israelis marked the one-month anniversary of the Hamas attack with small gestures and anguished calls for the return of the more than 240 hostages taken by Hamas fighters during their raid. Across the country, people lowered flags to half-staff at city halls and courthouses and stopped for a minute of silence at workplaces, schools and college campuses. Cafes set up shrines where people lit memorial candles.

In Gaza, heavy Israeli airstrikes, intensifying ground operations and a critical lack of basic resources have led to a mounting death toll and widespread suffering. More than 10,000 people, including more than 4,100 children, have been killed in the territory, according to its Health Ministry, which operates under the political arm of Hamas.

The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said on Monday that 89 employees of the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, had also been killed in Gaza. That is more “than in any comparable period in the history of our organization,” he told reporters, saying that many of the employees had been killed with members of their family.

Even as fighting still raged in Gaza, Antony J. Blinken, the secretary of state, said last week that the United States was in talks with Israel and other regional leaders about what “the day after” should look like. Two things, he said, were clear: Hamas cannot remain in power, and Israel has no desire to reoccupy Gaza."
119,119,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/world/middleeast/israeli-reservists.html,"A major change came after the Lebanon war: Dozens of reservists were killed after they were thrust into combat in the last days of the invasion. That prompted an outcry, leading the Israeli military to overhaul the system. The military shrank the size of the reserves, cutting many less well-trained members. Today, less than 5 percent of Israel’s population serves in a reserve unit.

The military has created tiers of reservists, from highly trained troops who serve in elite units or pilots who fly fighter planes, to less well-trained people who police settlements in the West Bank or patrol villages along the Lebanese border. But elite reservists are deployed in Gaza, some in units that include professional soldiers.

The diverse economic and social backgrounds of reservists means that some are openly critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, even as they fervently believe in the military’s mission. Along with their army-issued fatigues, some wear T-shirts emblazoned with the symbols of the mass rallies last summer against Mr. Netanyahu’s overhaul of the Israeli judiciary.

With time on their hands, political debates are common. “You’ll have guys poking fun at each other, saying, ‘I hope you don’t go back to the demonstrations when you go home,’” Dr. Erez said. “It’s not very contentious. People realize that this is something important; they agree that something bigger is going on.”

There are consequences for being too outspoken. On Monday, Israeli news media reported that an air force reservist was fired for criticizing Mr. Netanyahu in a private WhatsApp group. “Political comments while serving in uniform is against the rules,” an Israeli military spokesman said.

Military analysts said the opposition toward Mr. Netanyahu could spell trouble for Israeli commanders if the reservists were asked to take part in operations that could endanger the 240 people being held by Hamas. The government’s handling of the hostages has touched a nerve with the public.

“The risk is that the issue of the hostages is not settled soon, and we see a danger to the hostages in the ground operation,” said Yagil Levy, a professor and expert on the military at the Open University of Israel. “You may see a kind of protest and even resistance among some units in the military.”

In the idle hours, rumors and dark theories can take root. “They tell me that they take a kid who is 8 or 9 years old, pack him with an explosive vest and send him,” Sergeant Schnider said of the militants in Gaza. “What are you supposed to do? I really don’t want to get into that situation.”

While reservists tend to be older and in less prime physical shape than regular soldiers, military officials insist that their training and equipment is up to the task in Gaza or elsewhere. Some former commanders argue that their accomplishments outside the military are a net plus for the war effort.

“The reservists may run slower, but they are level-minded,” said Brig. Gen. Ari Singer, a former chief reserves officer of the Israeli military. “The leadership in the reserves is more authentic, not related to the ranks you have on your shoulder.”

Still, reservists may also become restive if their tours last too long. Many are married with children, and the call-up has disrupted work and family.

Manuel Trajtenberg, the director of Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies, estimated that about 500,000 workers were off the clock because of the mobilization and the ripple effects on spouses forced to interrupt jobs to take on domestic duties.

The loss of so much labor, he said, is likely to cause a rare, significant decline in Israel’s per capita economic growth."

121,121,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-evacuation-corridor-south.html,"But some Gazans who have made or attempted the journey in recent days have described being fired at from the direction of Israeli tanks, despite the promise of safe passage, while others said they had seen bodies, or parts of bodies, scattered around the road. The United Nations is aware of such reports but has not identified who was responsible, said one U.N. official who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.

Asked about reports of Israeli tanks firing at refugees, the Israeli military said in a statement that it had been targeting Hamas throughout Gaza. It said its attacks on military targets were conducted under international law, including taking “feasible precautions to mitigate civilian casualties.”

On Sunday, Anas Al Kourd, a paramedic at Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, drove south with his cousin, whose legs had been amputated after she was wounded in the war, and others, including four children. Theirs was the only car in sight. Around them, everyone held their hands up in a gesture of surrender as they walked, carrying little but white flags, he said.

As they approached Kuwait Square, a major intersection in Gaza City, they came under fire, forcing them to retreat, he said. Two or three times they tried to move forward, only to have to turn around again because of incoming fire.

When they finally made it to the square, he said, he could see more than 50 Israeli tanks nearby, sitting where an olive grove used to be. He said he waved the blanket covering his cousin in place of a white flag, while some of his companions, who are dual citizens, waved their red German passports.

Mr. Al Kourd had covered about a third of the remaining distance to the middle zone of Gaza, bumping over splintered trees and concrete blocks, when he said they were fired on again. He was driving at “mad speed” to escape, he said, when a missile or bomb from a warplane hit nearby. No one was struck, but their car hit a crater in the road and went flying, he said.

“I don’t know how we survived,” he said a day later, having made it to the middle zone of the Gaza Strip. His account could not be independently confirmed."
122,122,https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000009162689/gop-debate-israel-war-nikki-haley-ramaswamy.html,"The third Republican debate will take place in Miami, and it will feature a smaller field of candidates than the first two faceoffs. The issue that’s likely to dominate the debate is the conflict in Israel and Gaza. “We need to commit ourselves to ensure that good defeats evil.” The question is not whether the candidates are going to support Israel. It’s how strongly they will signal their backing. “The U.S. role here should absolutely be to stand with Israel.” “I stand with Israel.” “America has Israel’s back.” For Nikki Haley, this is really an important opportunity. In some ways, world events are really playing into her assets in this race. She, of course, was Trump’s former ambassador to the United Nations. And in that role, she really placed support for Israel front and center. “Israel must stand up for its own survival as a nation, but it also stands up for the ideals of freedom and human dignity that the United Nations is supposed to be about.” One likely exchange to watch out for could be between Haley and Florida governor, Ron DeSantis. DeSantis has attacked Haley for expressing too much sympathy for civilians in Gaza — “America has always been sympathetic to the fact that you can separate civilians from terrorists” — calling her, quote unquote, “politically correct.” “She’s trying to be politically correct.” A super PAC for his campaign is even running ads attacking her along those lines. Already we’ve seen Haley go after Vivek Ramaswamy, the candidate with the least foreign policy experience. “You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows. It shows.” Ramaswamy has had a few viral moments, but he’s really urged Americans to focus more on problems here at home, and has urged the country to stay out of the conflict. “I would love nothing more than for the I.D.F. to put the heads of the top hundred Hamas leaders on stakes and line them up on the Israel-Gaza border. But that is Israel’s decision to make — not ours.” Like the previous two debates, Donald Trump won’t be on the stage on Wednesday night. He’s spoken about the conflict in fairly militaristic terms. “We will fully support the Israelis and their mission to ensure that Hamas is decimated and these atrocities will be avenged.” He’s also had some stumbles. Immediately after the Oct. 7 attacks, Trump praised Hezbollah — “Hezbollah is very smart, they’re all very smart” — and criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “Bibi Netanyahu let us down. That was a very terrible thing, I will say that.” It’s one of the few issues Republicans have attacked the former president over. “Now is not the time to be attacking our ally.” “Only a fool would make those kind of comments.” And it wouldn’t be surprising to hear more of that kind of criticism from the debate stage on Wednesday night. For Haley, this all presents a pretty interesting opportunity. Many Republicans who would like to see someone other than Donald Trump become the nominee believe the only way to get there is to turn this primary into a one-on-one contest. So if Nikki Haley can use this opportunity to sort of claim the mantle as the most dominant Trump alternative, she could be in a really strong position."
123,123,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/world/middleeast/shekel-dollar-bank-of-israel.html,"The Bank of Israel said on Tuesday that it had spent $7.3 billion to support the shekel, which had fallen to an eight-year low after Hamas’s attack on Oct. 7. The currency is now back to about where it was before the invasion, and on Tuesday was trading at around 3.87 shekels to the dollar.

As Israel’s economy reels from an intensifying military campaign against Hamas, the country’s central bank has been working behind the scenes to provide financial stability where it can, including setting aside $30 billion to bolster the currency.

Even so, the prospect of a drawn-out military operation looms over a troubled economy that had been riding high. The central bank last week cut its growth forecasts and warned of the negative impact of the war on the Israeli economy and financial markets. The bank said growth would cool to an annual rate of 2.3 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2024, from an expected 3 percent growth pace for both years forecast in August — if the war stays confined to Gaza.

Around 300 prominent Israeli economists called on Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to shield the economy from a looming downturn, which they said would cost tens of billions of shekels. “You do not understand the magnitude of the crisis that Israel’s economy is facing,” they wrote in a joint letter last week.

The group urged “a massive diversion” of money away from a program approved in summer for the ultra-Orthodox community, arguing that the funds should instead be spent on rebuilding “the damage caused by the war,” providing aid for victims and rehabilitating the economy.

Two credit ratings agencies have warned that Israel’s debt could be downgraded, depending on the severity and length of the conflict. A downgrade would increase the interest costs for Israel’s government when it borrows money.

Israel’s finance ministry approved a war compensation package last week to help support people and businesses, including housing for evacuees from combat zones. The government will also offer grants and state-backed loans to small and midsize businesses, and is creating a fund to help businesses cover fixed expenses, including employee salaries. The plan is awaiting approval by the Knesset."
125,125,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/world/middleeast/gaza-hospitals-al-shifa-israel.html,"Operations at Gaza’s main hospital were showing signs of collapse on Saturday, with its director and the Gazan Health Ministry describing power outages, shortages of water and medicine and a crisis in treating seriously wounded patients and vulnerable children, while battles between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters raged ever closer.

Israel’s ground invasion of the territory has moved deeper into Gaza City in the last few days, slowly closing in on the hospitals that have provided refuge for tens of thousands but that Israel says are shielding Hamas military operations in tunnels below.

Many doctors and nurses have vowed to stay and treat the wounded who keep pouring in, despite the dwindling supplies and an Israeli order to evacuate the northern half of Gaza. At four hospitals, though, doctors, patients and displaced Gazans were mostly able to evacuate as Israeli troops approached, the Israeli military and the Gaza Health Ministry said on Saturday.

Israel’s military campaign against Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, and the worsening humanitarian crisis there have drawn outcries from the United Nations and much of the world, fueling protests in major cities and anger across much of the Middle East. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of protesters calling for an end to Israel’s bombardment marched through London."
126,126,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/opinion/israel-hamas-cease-fire.html,"Each day the Israel-Gaza war continues, the risks of a cataclysm intensify.

After Israel’s horrific loss of over 1,400 civilians and soldiers on Oct. 7, the civilian death toll of Palestinians in Gaza is now nothing short of staggering. More than 10,300 Palestinians have been killed since the beginning of the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, including over 4,100 children. Conditions are deteriorating fast in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, with at least 155 Palestinians killed, over 2,150 arrested and threats of ethnic cleansing being voiced by Israeli political and settler leaders.

In the north, relatively measured daily exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah could explode into a full-blown conflict any day, engulfing much of Lebanon and Israel. The ramped-up U.S. military deployment in the region may be framed as preventive, but it also signals to Israel’s leaders that it can drag America into this war — a risky addition to calculations, miscalculations and unpredictability all around. The wider regional conflagration is already here. The question is how bad it will get.

A vast majority of global leaders and all Arab leaders have demanded an immediate cease-fire, recognizing the danger of a metastasizing crisis, as have the heads of 18 U.N. agencies. The nations opposing a cease-fire — Israel, the United States, some European countries and a few others — might acknowledge the perils looming. But they insist that after Oct. 7, Israel must be allowed to militarily eliminate Hamas and should be supported in that quest, despite the unconscionable and growing cost in civilian life.

But there are two important ideas that could get us out of this war — both in the short term and in the long term.

In the near term, a suspension of hostilities should be seized on as the offramp leading to a permanent cessation.

So far, Israel has rebuffed the notion. Even the U.S. calls last week for a limited humanitarian pause in the fighting in Gaza, while wholly insufficient in scope, were quickly rejected by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

From the early days of the crisis, Qatar has been mediating behind-the-scenes negotiations with Israel, Hamas and the United States for a deal to secure the release of Israelis and others being held in Gaza. Last month an agreement was close to being finalized, according to current and former officials in three of the involved regional capitals, for the release of all civilian women, children, older adults and the sick in exchange for a five-day cessation of hostilities and to allow more humanitarian assistance to enter Gaza. Israel nixed that deal by launching its ground incursion.

Seeing more people freed in a deal could invigorate popular demand in Israel to prioritize the release of the rest of those being held in Gaza. That, in tandem with a time-limited cessation, could build international momentum and external pressure for Israel to end its bombardment of Gaza. The United States would need to push for such an outcome, working alongside Qatar and regional states that have Israel’s ear. The visit by the C.I.A. director, Bill Burns, to Israel and Qatar this week suggests a revival of talks for a prisoner release package. If Mr. Netanyahu continues to hold out, other members of his war cabinet or governing coalition might be persuadable, even if it means seeing him replaced in favor of new or caretaker leadership with Knesset approval.

In the long term, the Israeli government’s commitment to destroying Hamas risks becoming another unobtainable holy grail. One thing Oct. 7 made strikingly clear was that Israel cannot provide security for its citizens by controlling millions of Palestinians, who are denied their rights and freedoms and live under a system of permanent structural violence and inequality. The “no cease-fire” crowd must desist from encouraging Israel to hang on to the historically discredited fiction that armed resistance rooted in an oppressed people can be eliminated by the deployment of even more ferocious military methods.

Israel’s failure to offer detailed plans for postwar Gaza indicates the degree of dysfunction in Israeli thinking. The oft-stated Israeli leadership commitment to destroying Hamas ignores the reality of what that movement is. Hamas is both an armed group that uses terrorism and is a political movement that has won elections and has been governing Gaza for more than 15 years. It also embodies an idea — namely that resistance is part of the struggle for Palestinian liberation. Hamas is not an external, ISIS-style nihilistic cadre; it is deeply embedded in the fabric of Palestinian society. Its popularity surely increases not with a thirst for blood but rather as other avenues for achieving liberation are closed to Palestinians.

Moreover, the alternative offered by the Palestinian Authority, sustained via security cooperation with Israel, has been discredited in the eyes of most Palestinians by the entrenchment and intensification of Israeli occupation, including a more than fourfold increase in illegal Israeli settlers in the West Bank since the Oslo process began.

Palestinians can no longer avoid dealing with the legitimacy deficit in their leadership, which lacks credibility, representativeness and a strategy for achieving freedom. Both the Palestine Liberation Organization and its subsidiary, the Palestinian Authority, need to be renewed and expanded to increase their inclusivity, including but not limited to Hamas representation in the P.L.O. Revamped Palestinian national political structures will be a critical component in advancing broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict resolution after this war.

That may sound like a pipe dream. How can Israel be expected to engage, even indirectly, with a political body in which Hamas is represented? The hard truth is that this is precisely what coming to terms with ugly, violent, protracted conflict looks like. There is a path to Israeli security, and it entails security and rights for Palestinians. Previous Israeli governments eventually talked to the once-banned P.L.O. Any future government that is serious about a way forward will have to engage with a reformed P.L.O. in which Hamas is represented.

Nations that have come out against a cease-fire may believe they are cheering Israel on to a righteous victory, but Israel’s current course only ensures its perpetual instability. Hamas is not the existential threat that Israel thinks it is, but Israel’s overreach and extremism might just be. It has been said many times that what Israel needs from its friends and supporters is to be pulled back from the precipice. America’s guaranteeing of Israeli impunity and unwillingness to meaningfully address Palestinian suffering has for too long failed Israelis and Palestinians alike.

Oct. 7 and its aftermath can be a catalyst for the previously unthinkable — for good and for bad.

The road back from the hell of a zero-sum “us or them” begins with the humanizing of the other. Maybe it’s a road that eventually leads us back to a two-state dispensation. Or maybe the partition paradigm is part of the problem, encouraging separation and the idea that walls must exist between Palestinians and Israelis. There are no quick or easy solutions. But if our nightmares emerged in failing to anticipate and prevent the horrors of Oct. 7 and every day since, then we should unleash our political imagination in laying the groundwork for a future of life and hope."
127,127,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/us/politics/israel-gaza-war-death-toll-civilians.html,"Israeli officials say they have no choice: Hamas fighters, numbering perhaps 30,000 by Israeli estimates, embed within Gaza’s population of 2.2 million and store weapons in or under civilian sites, daring Israel to launch strikes that fuel outrage. The officials also say Hamas is clearly guilty of intentionally murdering Israeli civilians.

President Biden and his aides have been careful not to even hint in public that Israel could be violating any laws of war. And the State Department continues to approve sales of weapons to Israel while refraining from making any assessments of the legality of Israel’s actions. Some diplomats are uneasy with that, especially since the department formally pledged earlier this year to investigate episodes of civilian casualties involving American-made weapons.

Israel says it is impossible to defeat its enemy without killing innocents — a lesson that Americans and their allies should understand.

“In 1944, the Royal Air Force bombed the Gestapo headquarters in Copenhagen — a perfectly legitimate target,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said in an address to his nation on Oct. 30. “But the British pilots missed and instead of the Gestapo headquarters, they hit a children’s hospital nearby. And I think 84 children were harmed and burned to death. That is not a war crime. That is not something you blame Britain for doing.” (In fact the bombing was in 1945, hit a school, and is believed to have killed 86 children and 18 adults.)

Mr. Netanyahu added that the attack “was a legitimate act of war with tragic consequences that accompany such legitimate action. And you didn’t tell the Allies, ‘Don’t stamp out Nazism because of such tragic consequences.’”

Israeli officials have also invoked American battles against insurgents in the Iraqi city of Falluja in 2004, during the U.S. occupation of Iraq, and, in tandem with Iraqi government forces, against the Islamic State terrorist group in the Iraqi city of Mosul from 2016 to 2017.

And during Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visits to Israel after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, Israeli officials privately invoked the 1945 U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

“In any combat situation, like when the United States was leading a coalition to get ISIS out of Mosul, there were civilian casualties,” Mark Regev, an Israeli government spokesman, said in an Oct. 24 interview with PBS. Mr. Regev said that Israel’s “ratio” of Hamas fighters to civilians killed “compares very well to NATO and other Western forces” in past military campaigns."

129,129,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/us/politics/reoccupying-gaza-us-israel.html,"The White House cautioned Israel on Tuesday against reoccupying Gaza after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that his country could hold a security role there “for an indefinite period” once the war is over.

“We’re having active discussions with our Israeli counterparts about what post-conflict Gaza looks like,” John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, told reporters. “The president maintains his position that reoccupation by Israeli forces is not the right thing to do.”

The words of caution came after Mr. Netanyahu said Israel would need to oversee the security of the Gaza Strip once the fighting is over to prevent future attacks. Mr. Netanyahu, in an interview with ABC News, did not say who should govern the enclave after Hamas, which now controls it, is gone. But he said he thought Israel would “have the overall security responsibility” over the territory indefinitely.

President Biden previously said that it would be “a big mistake” for Israel to reoccupy Gaza, from which it withdrew in 2005.

The United States has offered staunch support for Israel since the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas, which killed more than 1,400 people, according to Israeli authorities. A post-conflict Gaza, Mr. Biden has said, “can’t be Hamas,” an organization whose founding covenant embraces “killing the Jews” and wiping out Israel. The United States and the European Union have designated Hamas a terrorist group.

But as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, the United States increasingly is trying to balance its backing for Israel with calls for the protection of Palestinian noncombatants and for “humanitarian pauses” in the fighting."
130,130,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/opinion/isaac-herzog-israel-hamas-gaza.html,"I write these lines from Jerusalem, after spending time with the families of some of the 240 people kidnapped by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7. The hostages now held in Gaza include Jewish Israelis, Muslim Israelis and foreign citizens of different ethnicities.

In all my years of public life, the meetings with these families were the most difficult and fraught I’ve ever held. I’ve also spoken with families of some of the more than 1,400 of my people who were killed that day, many of them murdered in their living rooms and kitchens or dancing at a music festival. When I returned from one kibbutz devastated in the attack, I had to wash the blood off my shoes.

Tragedy is part of Israeli life, and I knew it would be part of my time as president. But none of us imagined a tragedy like this.

Against our will, we in Israel find ourselves at a tipping point for the Middle East and for the world and at the center of what is nothing less than an existential struggle. This is not a battle between Jews and Muslims. And it is not just between Israel and Hamas. It is between those who adhere to norms of humanity and those practicing a barbarism that has no place in the modern world.

Just like ISIS and Al Qaeda, the Hamas terrorists who attacked Israeli homes and families had no qualms about burning babies. They tortured children, raped women and destroyed peace-loving communities. They were so proud of their deeds that they made sure to capture them on video and even broadcast them live. These videos will forever remain a stain on those Palestinians and their supporters who celebrated that day and a testament to the depravity of the terrorists and of the ideas that inspired them.

But almost as disturbing for me is the realization that many in the world, including in the West, are willing to rationalize these actions or even support them outright. In the capitals of Europe we’ve seen rallies supporting the total destruction of Israel “from the river to the sea.” Professors and students at American colleges make speeches and sign statements justifying terrorism, even glorifying it.

We’ve heard certain governments fail to denounce Hamas, instead condemning Israel’s response and even seeking to offer justification for Hamas’s atrocities. It would have been unthinkable to hear such moral confusion uttered after the Sept. 11 attacks or after bombings in London, Barcelona and Baghdad. When I spoke to a joint meeting of Congress this year, I said terrorism “contradicts humanity’s most basic principles of peace.” It turns out that not everyone agrees.

All of this shows that this collision of values is happening not just here in Israel but everywhere and that the terrorist ideology threatens all decent people, not only Jews. History has taught us that foul ideologies often find the Jewish people first — but tend not to stop there. We find ourselves on the front lines of this battle, but all nations face this threat, and they must understand that they could be next.

Since Hamas forced this war on us, our military has been acting to permanently eliminate this unbearable threat and to enable the return of our hostages. This means fighting in the battlefield that Hamas has created in Gaza over many years — one in which terrorists hide behind and within the civilian population. This is a battlefield with terrorist tunnels under civilian streets, one in which civilian casualties are not avoided at all costs but rather encouraged by Hamas in order to draw global sympathy and blunt Israel’s response. Not only does Hamas store rockets under schools and homes; our intelligence and the confessions of captured terrorists show that the Hamas command center is hidden under Gaza’s central hospital.

The result of these sickening tactics is the civilian suffering we are all watching unfold. Many reports of the humanitarian difficulties in parts of Gaza are unverifiable, but there is real suffering, and it concerns us, too. These are our neighbors, and our full withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 was meant to give them free lives and open the door for peace. To our dismay, Hamas and its many Palestinian supporters chose otherwise.

Even as Hamas fires hundreds of rockets at our cities and as our soldiers fall in battle, we’re making an effort to give early warning to civilians with leaflets and phone calls, to move them out of the main battle zones and to enable humanitarian aid through Gaza’s border with Egypt. Hundreds of aid trucks are now arriving, with more expected each day.

But anyone who thinks the cynical exploitation of civilian suffering will tie our hands and save Hamas this time is wrong. For us and for the Palestinians, the suffering will end only with the removal of Hamas. Anyone trying to tie our hands is, intentionally or not, undermining not only Israel’s defense but also any hope for a world where these atrocities cannot happen.

In the months and years before the Hamas massacre, we began to see signs of the emergence of a better Middle East, from the Persian Gulf to North Africa — one inspired by progress and partnership, one in which Israel could finally feel at home among our neighbors. Will this be the world that emerges from this crisis? Or will it be the world desired by the murderous fundamentalists of Hamas?

These questions will be key among the strategic issues on the agenda in our discussions with Secretary of State Antony Blinken during his visit to the region beginning Friday — as they were during the visit to Israel of President Biden a few weeks ago.

Much is at stake at this moment, not just the future of Israel. On Oct. 7 we were all jolted awake and presented with a shocking challenge to our hopes and morals. How we meet this challenge will shape our future."
131,131,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/world/middleeast/protest-statue-of-liberty-israel-gaza.html,"Hundreds of protesters boarded ferries to the Statue of Liberty on Monday, carrying banners calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war that they unfurled from the statue’s pedestal.

The protest, led by the activist group Jewish Voice for Peace, was the latest in a series of protests, vigils and other events that Americans on opposing sides of the conflict have organized almost daily in cities across the country since the beginning of the war. Over the weekend, thousands marched in pro-Palestinian demonstrations in cities ranging from Cincinnati to Provo, Utah, as the death toll in Gaza continued to mount.

In New York, a coalition of Jewish groups held a vigil on Monday evening near Central Park to mark the 30 days since Hamas’s attack on Oct. 7 and to call for solidarity with Israel.

The protest at the Statue of Liberty began inconspicuously. The protesters mixed with tourists milling around on Liberty Island until — spurred by an outburst of song that rang out from near the statue’s pedestal — they pulled on black T-shirts marked with the words “Jews Say Cease Fire Now,” and began climbing the pedestal stairs.

The protesters, now assembled below the statue’s feet, dropped several banners from the edge of the stairs; the signs bore slogans that included “Palestinians should be free” and “The world is watching.”

Jay Saper, 32, a spokesperson for Jewish Voice for Peace who uses they/them pronouns, said the group had chosen the location because it was “inspired by the lineage of many people who have made their calls for justice here on this island.”

Last week, Jewish Voice for Peace organized a large protest at Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan that disrupted the evening commute. Organizers said the protest on Monday was meant to “keep up the pressure.”

“We know that today the Israeli government is hailing bombs down on Gaza City and has cut off electricity from the rest of Gaza, plunging everyone into darkness,” said Elena Stein, 35, a community organizer and director of organizing strategy for Jewish Voice for Peace who lives in Brooklyn. “And so our response is to come to this iconic American location that represents peace and liberty, as Jews, and other people of conscience, to say, ‘Not in our name. Let Gaza live.’”

The protesters, who risked arrest by federal law enforcement officers, eventually marched to the Liberty Island ferry landing, where they boarded a ferry back to Battery Park in Manhattan. Mx. Saper said that there had been no arrests."

Days after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that oversees Gaza, the Israeli military called for all residents of northern Gaza — about half the entire population of the territory — to evacuate to southern Gaza as it prepared for a ground invasion. But Israel did not publicly suggest that Palestinians cross the Egyptian border, which has been largely sealed since the start of the war.

Egypt has rejected the idea of a temporary displacement, let alone a permanent one. A spokesman for the Egyptian government declined to comment for this article, referring instead to a speech made last month by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the Egyptian president, that dismissed the idea.

“Egypt has affirmed and reiterated its complete rejection of the forced displacement of Palestinians and their exodus to Egyptian lands in Sinai, as this is nothing but a final liquidation of the Palestinian cause,” Mr. el-Sisi said in a speech published on his website.

Some of Mr. Netanyahu’s political allies, however, have publicly backed the idea of temporarily moving large numbers of Gazans to Egypt as well as to other countries in the region and in the West.

Danny Danon, a lawmaker from Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud party and a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, said he supported evacuating Gazan civilians to give Israel more room to maneuver during its ground invasion of Gaza, and to move civilians out of harm’s way.

“We’re trying to lower the level of casualties for our troops and for the civilians,” Mr. Danon said in a phone interview. “We expect not only the Egyptians, but the entire international community to make a genuine effort to support and accept the residents of Gaza.”

Mr. Danon added that the idea would need the agreement of the Egyptian government, which controls Gaza’s southern border. However, Mr. Danon is not a member of the government and could not confirm whether Israel had been pushing foreign governments to back such a plan.

Israel’s diplomatic push has added to a growing sense of uncertainty about what will happen if Israel takes control over parts or all of Gaza, even temporarily, at the end of its military operations."
133,133,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/arts/screening-footage-israel-hollywood.html,"Having produced movies like “Pulp Fiction” and “Reservoir Dogs,” Lawrence Bender has a high tolerance for make-believe violence on film. But he wasn’t sure he could sit through raw footage of the real thing: the killings of Israeli civilians by Hamas.

Still, Bender felt strongly that the massacre in Israel last month, in which more than 1,400 people were killed, has not been met with an appropriate level of public outrage and sympathy for the Jewish people. “On Oct. 7, where were all of our friends?” he asked. “They were missing. I thought that they would have showed up, the way we feel like we always as Jews show up for everybody else.”

It was in part this sense of abandonment and isolation that drew him and others to the auditorium of the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles on Wednesday evening for a screening of the footage, which had been compiled by the Israeli military, at an event called “Bearing Witness.” With Israel facing mounting criticism for killing thousands of Palestinians in Gaza as it goes after Hamas, the screening was organized to show the brutality with which Hamas targeted Israeli civilians on Oct. 7, with wrenching footage of people being gunned down and images of bloody teenagers and lifeless children.

“We not only need to defend ourselves: We also need to defend the truth,” said one of the organizers, Sara Greenberg — a former foreign affairs adviser to the Israeli prime minister whose husband, Lt. Col. Amnon Shefler, is a spokesman for the Israeli military. “Just as there are those who deny the Holocaust, there are those who are attempting to deny and distort the atrocities committed by Hamas, despite the fact that the Hamas terrorists documented the attacks themselves.”"
134,134,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/world/middleeast/gaza-city-street-battles.html,"Israeli soldiers and armored vehicles have engaged Hamas fighters in days of running gun battles in Gaza City, fighting through rubble-filled streets and blasted-out buildings for control of the Gaza Strip’s largest urban center and the militants’ main stronghold.

As video trickled out showing striking images of urban combat that are reminiscent of the 20th century’s most brutal battles, the White House said on Thursday that Israel had agreed to daily four-hour pauses in the fighting in parts of the northern Gaza Strip to allow civilians to flee and allow aid to reach them.

Israel also agreed to open a second corridor for people to escape northern Gaza, a White House statement said, and to give three hours’ advance notice of each pause, going beyond the pauses it has already observed this week to allow civilians to move southward along a single corridor.

After more than a month of aerial and ground combat, the Gaza Strip is embroiled in a split-screen war that pairs intense scenes of fighting with a dramatically deteriorating humanitarian crisis. In addition to the critical shortages of food, water and medicines already plaguing the territory, a lack of hygiene, sanitation and health care are putting Gaza’s more than two million residents — most of whom have fled their homes and crowded into the southern part of the territory — at risk of a rapid spread of infectious diseases.

Well over 10,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-controlled government; President Biden has cautioned against accepting its figures, but a top administration official said on Wednesday that the numbers given so far could be an undercount. Testifying before the House Committee on Foreign Relations, Barbara Leaf, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, said that the Palestinian death toll, while difficult to assess accurately, was “very high, frankly — and it could be that they’re even higher than are being cited.”"
135,135,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/us/politics/israel-hamas-gaza-deaths.html,"The Israeli military has limited time to carry out its operations in Gaza before anger among Arabs in the region and frustration in the United States and other countries over the spiraling civilian death toll constrain Israel’s goal of eradicating Hamas, U.S. officials said this week.

As senior Biden administration officials push Israel to do more to minimize civilian casualties, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Wednesday that he was worried each civilian killed in Gaza could generate future members of Hamas.

General Brown did not call for a cease-fire. But when asked by reporters traveling with him to Tokyo if he was worried that high civilian casualty numbers would generate future Hamas militants, he replied, “Yes, very much so.”

His comment offered a rare glimpse of divisions between Israel and the Biden administration, which has declared its support for Israel’s military campaign even as the civilian death toll has increased. It came as the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said that the number of civilians killed in the Gaza Strip showed that there was something “clearly wrong” with Israel’s military operations against Hamas.

Israel launched a ground invasion after Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters rampaged through southern Israel on Oct. 7, indiscriminately killing women, children, babies and the elderly. More than 1,400 people were slain and more than 240 were taken hostage and ferried to Gaza, the Israeli authorities say. On Wednesday, Israeli investigators said that “victims were tortured, physically abused, raped, burned alive and dismembered.”

The level of carnage has deeply shaken Israel and shaped its military response. The country’s leaders have vowed to eliminate Hamas, which is committed to the destruction of Israel, and to kill everyone implicated in the Oct. 7 atrocities."
136,136,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/us/kissinger-israel-egypt.html,"Henry A. Kissinger is a key figure in the modern history of the Middle East, and his legacy is reflected in the current war in Gaza.

One of Mr. Kissinger’s most notable contributions was his role in establishing peace between Israel and Egypt. The two nations have since cooperated in enforcing a 16-year blockade of Gaza, and in the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in the enclave after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks on Israel provoked a full-scale war.

Egypt, through Mr. Kissinger’s diplomacy, “went from being in the Soviet sphere of influence into the American sphere of influence,” said Bren Carlill, a spokesman for the Zionist Federation of Australia, an umbrella organization for the Australian Jewish community. “That, in my opinion, was one of, if not the greatest, Cold War victories for American foreign policy.”

After its founding in 1948, Israel fought five wars with Egypt, notably the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, also known as the Yom Kippur War, after Egypt and Syria coordinated a surprise attack on Israel over Israeli-occupied territory around the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. That was the last war between Egypt and Israel.

Mr. Kissinger, who was a Jewish refugee in his youth, facilitated intense negotiations with Israel, Egypt and its Arab allies that helped end that war. Those talks proved to be a turning point in Middle East history.

Through 33 days of traveling the region — a back-and-forth journey that was called “shuttle diplomacy” — he persuaded Israel and Egypt to begin direct talks and make significant concessions. His marathon meetings in Jerusalem, Cairo and Damascus helped pave the way to the 1978 Camp David Accords, which formally ended the state of war between Israel and Egypt, helped open the path for diplomatic relations between the two countries and led to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Sinai Peninsula.

“He never lost sight of the need to maintain equilibrium in the Middle East,” said Bilahari Kausikan, a former diplomat and chairman of the Middle East Institute at the National University of Singapore.

At home, he was a complicated figure for some in the Jewish community. In a recording that came to light in 2010, Mr. Kissinger was heard telling President Richard M. Nixon in 1973 that helping Jewish people in the Soviet Union emigrate to the United States to escape totalitarian oppression was “not an objective of American foreign policy.” Some leaders of Jewish organizations called his words “despicable,” “callous” and “shocking,” although others tempered their criticism, noting his longstanding support for Israel.

“Kissinger was a very, very proud Jew,” Dr. Carlill said. “But absolutely, primarily, especially in his professional life, he put the interests of the U.S. first, beyond his Jewish identity, beyond Israel — as was entirely appropriate.”"
137,137,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostages-status.html,"Since the cease-fire took hold on Friday, Hamas had returned 60 hostages through Tuesday in negotiations involving Israel, and Israel had freed 180 imprisoned Palestinians. Tuesday’s release followed the return of 11 Israelis on Monday, 13 on Sunday, 13 on Saturday and 13 on Friday, nearly all of them women or children.

Ten more Israelis and 30 more Palestinians were expected to be freed on Wednesday. After that, there would be 27 women and children still held hostage in Gaza, according to a senior Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.

Seventeen Thais, one Filipino and one Russian-Israeli dual citizen had also been released by Tuesday, through separate negotiations. Four other hostages were released before the cease-fire.

Hamas said it had released two more people on Wednesday after talks with Moscow; Israeli media reported that they were dual Russian-Israeli citizens. The Israeli military later confirmed that two Israeli hostages had been returned outside the main channel of negotiations, but did not say if they were Russian or otherwise dual citizens.

At least four hostages are believed to have died in captivity, according to Israel and Hamas. Israeli officials said that three — a 19-year-old soldier, Noa Marciano; Yehudit Weiss, 65; and Ravid Katz, 51 — were killed by their captors. Arye Zalmanovich, 86, died after suffering a heart attack, Hamas has said.

Hamas said on Wednesday that three members of the Bibas family who were kidnapped in the Hamas raid had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli military said it could not immediately confirm or deny the claim.

Israel and Hamas agreed on Monday to extend their truce to six days — through at least Wednesday — to allow for the release of more Israeli hostages and imprisoned Palestinians, and for more humanitarian aid to flow into the Gaza Strip, where thousands of Gazans have been killed and conditions for the living have deteriorated to the point of catastrophe.

Since the cease-fire began, Israel has continued its escalation of nighttime raids in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank, arresting at least 71 more Palestinians since Nov. 24, according to the Israeli military. The Palestinian Authority’s commission for prisoner affairs put the number of those arrested at 112 or more, including women, children and older people."
138,138,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostages-gaza.html,"Top officials from Qatar, Egypt and the United States pushed on Wednesday to lock in another temporary extension of the cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, seeing it as the best way to ease the embattled territory’s humanitarian crisis, secure the release of more Israeli hostages and slow the war’s escalating death toll for at least a little longer.

But some officials briefed on the talks said they also hoped that the succession of short-term pauses would pave the way toward a larger goal: negotiations over a longer-term cease-fire between Israel and Hamas to bring the war to a close.

Amid international pressure to prolong the pause in fighting, Israeli leaders rejected out of hand the notion of a long-term truce, reiterating their vow to fight until Hamas and its leaders have been eliminated.

“In recent days I have heard a question: After completing this stage of the return of our hostages, will Israel go back to the fighting? My answer is an unequivocal yes,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement on Wednesday. “There is no situation in which we do not go back to fighting until the end.”"

140,140,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/world/middleeast/ahed-tamimi-prisoner-exchange.html,"The prominent Palestinian activist Ahed Tamimi and more than two dozen other women and children were released from Israeli prisons early Thursday, Israeli and Palestinian authorities said, in the latest exchange for hostages held in Gaza.

The Israeli military arrested Ms. Tamimi, 22, in a predawn raid on Nov. 6 on suspicion of inciting violence and calling for terrorist activity, but did not bring charges against her for the nearly three weeks she was jailed in the Damon Prison, near Haifa, Israel.

According to her lawyer, Mahmoud Hassan, Ms. Tamimi was beaten during her arrest and after she was transferred, in violation of international law, to the prison in Israel from the occupied West Bank.

The military had moved on Sunday to keep Ms. Tamimi imprisoned under administrative detention, which would have allowed it to hold her indefinitely without charge or trial. But her name later appeared on the Israeli government’s list of Palestinian prisoners and detainees approved for potential release in the hostage exchange. Her father, the longtime protest leader Bassem Tamimi, is also imprisoned without charge.

Ms. Tamimi’s mother, Nariman Tamimi, said on Tuesday that her joy over the prospect of her daughter's release was tempered by repeated threats of violence made against the family by Israeli settlers and by Israel’s security forces, who have banned any celebrations and fired tear gas to disperse crowds of Palestinians waiting to reunite with their loved ones and neighbors.

The sheer number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces since the start of the war has also left an indelible mark, Nariman Tamimi said. Health authorities in Gaza have said that more than 13,000 people had been killed in the enclave during the war, and that thousands more are believed to be trapped under the rubble.

“She would be coming back after the death of 17,000 people. You understand?” Nariman Tamimi said. “My daughter would return to my lap, but there are a thousand mothers who have lost their children and a thousand families that have perished.”

“I wish there didn’t have to be all this bloodshed for my daughter to be released,” she added. “The reality is that she shouldn’t have been imprisoned.”

Ms. Tamimi’s arrest was one of thousands carried out by Israeli forces since Oct. 7 in a bloody crackdown on the occupied West Bank for what they have said are counterterrorism measures. The precise number of arrests there is disputed; the Israeli military has reported more than 2,000, but the Palestinian Authority’s commission for prisoner affairs reports nearly 3,300.

Israeli forces have also killed at least 225 Palestinians in the West Bank since the crackdown began, making 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians there since 2005, according to the United Nations’ humanitarian agency.

A total of 30 Palestinians, including more than a dozen children, were released early Thursday. Among them was Suhair al-Barghouti, a 64-year-old woman who was arrested during a raid in October and placed in administrative detention, where she has been denied access to medication for her health issues, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Society, a nongovernmental rights group.

Ms. al-Barghouti hails from a well-known family of Palestinian resistance figures. Her husband, Omar al-Barghouti, was one of the longest-serving Palestinian prisoners and spent roughly three decades behind bars, much of it under administrative detention, before his death in 2021.

The couple’s sons have also spent years in Israeli detention, and one, Saleh al-Barghouti, was shot and killed by Israeli security forces in 2018 after he was accused of opening fire on Israeli settlers. Israel bulldozed their family home near Ramallah in 2019, according to Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s news agency.

And they put the Israeli flag here. And right now, if we try to cross 10 meters, the soldier will start to run, chasing us to go back here. And if we say, ‘This is my land,’ they start to shoot live.” Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in southern Israel, violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank has intensified. Extremist Israeli settlers have been emboldened in what Palestinians say is an increased effort to seize their land with support from the Israeli Army. On Oct. 13, Sami Hourani’s cousin Zacharia al-Adara was shot and wounded by an Israeli settler in the Palestinian village of at-Tuwani. It happened just a hundred meters from Hourani’s home. “The settler was holding a gun and he was clearly with civilian dress coming towards my village, he was attacking a house. The settler started to walk towards Zacharia and just shot him. Zacharia is since the 13th of October in the I.C.U. in the hospital. And the most scary part now is that if this will be the new reality that they want to do after the war.” Since Oct. 7, the U.N. has recorded more than 280 attacks by settlers in the occupied West Bank, opening fire on Palestinian villagers, destroying their farmland and setting fire to their businesses and homes. Observers say the attacks are part of the campaign for settlement expansion. “The closed house is here in front of us. Here is the village of Tuba, and that up there, there is the settlement of Ma’on.” Across the West Bank, there are more than 700,000 Israelis living in settlements that most of the world considers illegal. The Israeli Army says that it takes the violence very seriously and that it’s taken action to apprehend those responsible. However, human rights groups say arrests are rare, and soldiers have been seen accompanying settlers during some attacks, including the man who shot al-Adara on Oct. 13. Zvi Sukkot is a member of Israel’s Parliament representing the far-right religious Zionist party. He’s become a prominent voice in the movement to expand Israeli settlements. Sukkot first started making headlines more than a decade ago as a member of the hilltop youth, young Israelis who would squat areas of the West Bank with the hope of claiming the land for eventual new settlements. In 2012, Israel’s Security Agency accused him of leading covert and violent activity against Palestinians, and he was temporarily banned from entering the West Bank. But after Oct. 7, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed him to lead a committee handling security issues in the territory. Reporter: “What changed for you after the Hamas attacks of October 7?” Reporter: “Do you condemn the acts of violence being committed by Israeli settlers against Palestinians?” But for Palestinians that claim to the land means displacement. In the past seven weeks alone, the U.N. says more than 1,000 villagers have been forced to leave their homes due to settler violence across the West Bank. Dalal al-Awad and her family are farmers from a village called Tuba. They’ve survived multiple attacks by settlers who told them to leave. For now, the family has little choice but to pack up and move to the hills every night, sleeping outside, away from their home."
142,142,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/world/middleeast/netanyahu-cease-fire-politics.html,"As international pressure grows to extend a temporary cease-fire with Hamas, some right-wing members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government are threatening to bring it down if he does not resume fighting in Gaza.

The far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said on Wednesday that if Israel did not continue its war with Hamas, his political faction would leave the government coalition.

“Stopping the war = breaking apart the government,” said Mr. Ben-Gvir in a written statement.

While Mr. Ben-Gvir’s departure alone would not topple the government, it would give Mr. Netanyahu a very slim majority to keep his hold on power.

In a statement released after Mr. Ben-Gvir’s, Mr. Netanyahu insisted that the war would continue.

“There is no situation in which we do not go back to fighting until the end,” the prime minister said. “This is my policy. The entire Security Cabinet is behind it. The entire Government is behind it. The soldiers are behind it. The people are behind it — this is exactly what we will do.”

On Monday, Israel and Hamas agreed to prolong their cease-fire to six days from four, under a deal that would see the ongoing exchange of Palestinian prisoners for Israeli hostages, and mediators are trying to hammer out another extension. The longer pause was largely cheered by the Israeli public, which has been watching round-the-clock news coverage documenting the return of Israeli civilians who were kidnapped from their homes on Oct. 7.

But far-right members of Mr. Netanyahu’s government have been critical of the cease-fire, arguing that Israel should continue its military assault on Gaza. Mr. Ben-Gvir, who went from being a fringe figure in the Israeli settler movement to his current role in Mr. Netanyahu’s government, has been especially vocal, at times calling for Israel to “eliminate” anyone who supports Hamas.

Mr. Netanyahu can ill afford to alienate Mr. Ben-Gvir, who is part of a right-wing coalition of parties who give the prime minister a slim majority in the parliament. If he fails to hold a majority of the 120 seats, he would need to try to form a new coalition, or face another national election.

Two members of Mr. Netanyahu’s staff, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters, said the Israeli prime minister wanted to avoid elections at any cost.

Mr. Netanyahu’s approval ratings have steadily declined since the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel. In a poll conducted by Israel’s Bar-Ilan University earlier this month, trust in Mr. Netanyahu was at 4 percent. In another poll, conducted by the Israeli Maariv newspaper last week, 57 percent of Israelis said they would vote for Benny Gantz, a moderate member of Mr. Netanyahu’s war cabinet, for prime minister, over the 27 percent who said they would vote for Mr. Netanyahu.

Mr. Netanyahu has also been conducting his own polling, said the two staff members, and felt he would not fare well in a national election if it were held in the coming months."

The agreement to prolong the cease-fire to six days from four has raised expectations that both sides will now agree to more short extensions — but if that happens, it may only increase the competing pressures on Israel.

From the outside world, Israeli leaders will face calls to make the cease-fire permanent. Within their own country, however, there will be competing demands that they resume fighting and crush Hamas, while also securing the release of Israeli hostages.

On Tuesday, both Israel and Hamas accused each other of violating the truce.

Mia Schem, 21, a dual Israeli-French citizen, was abducted from the site of the Tribe of Nova music festival where at least 260 people were killed in the Hamas-led assault on Israel on Oct. 7.

She was shown in a video released by Hamas on Oct. 16, the first images released by the group of any of the roughly 240 hostages. In the video, she said that she had undergone surgery on her arm after being abducted, though the reason was unclear. (According to an analysis by The New York Times, metadata contained within the video file indicates that some of the footage was filmed at least six days before it was released.)

Amit Soussana, 40, a lawyer, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar Aza a few miles east of Gaza. At the time, she had been at home with a fever, according to The Times of Israel. Her family told Israeli news organizations that during the Oct. 7 assault, Ms. Soussana hid in a safe room in her house, but the attackers were still able to reach her.

She and her family are left-leaning politically and had called for peaceful coexistence with Palestinians. Her sister, Shira Soussana, said that the kidnapping has shaken the family’s sense of security. “We don’t have a belief anymore in people, it’s so evil,” she said, adding, “on both sides.”

Sometimes they did so unwittingly, believing there was no contradiction between being pro-Palestinian and supporting Israel’s right to exist, or not understanding the implications of the slogans they were chanting.

But just as often they have done so wittingly. When Mohamed Khairullah, the mayor of Prospect Park, N.J., said “75 years of occupation is too long” at an October rally, he was embracing the 1948 narrative. When Rashida Tlaib, the Michigan congresswoman, posted that “75 years later, the Nakba continues to this day” and declined to accept Israel as a Jewish state, she was embracing it. When Judith Butler, the Berkeley professor, told an interviewer that “the roots of the problem are in a state formation that depended on expulsions and land theft to establish its own ‘legitimacy’” and supported a binational state, she was embracing it. When the Los Angeles chapter of Black Lives Matter responded to the Oct. 7 massacres with a Facebook post claiming, “When a people have been subject to decades of apartheid and unimaginable violence, their resistance must not be condemned, but understood as a desperate act of self-defense,” it was embracing it. When the BBC Arabic service repeatedly described ordinary Israelis as “settlers,” it was embracing it.

Such embraces have consequences.

For one, they put a growing fraction of the progressive left objectively on the side of some of the worst people on earth — and in radical contradiction with their professed values.

“A left that, rightly, demands absolute condemnation of white-nationalist supremacy refuses to disassociate itself from Islamist supremacy,” Susie Linfield, a professor of journalism at N.Y.U., wrote in an important recent essay in the online journal Quillette. “A left that lauds intersectionality hasn’t noticed that Hamas’s axis of support consists of Iran, famous most recently for killing hundreds of protesters demanding women’s freedom.”"

148,148,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/travel/tourism-israel-jordan-lebanon-egypt.html,"The ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, which erupted in early October, has halted international tourism to Israel and severely blunted travel to neighboring countries in a ripple effect spreading across the entire Middle East. While the slowdown in international visitors is only one of the war’s economic repercussions in the region, it poses a significant threat to the economies of Egypt, Jordan and other nations heavily dependent on tourism and has swiftly reversed a banner year of travel in the Middle East.

The war has affected all segments of the travel industry, with international travel operators scaling back or postponing excursions, cruise lines redeploying ships and airlines dramatically reducing service. And many travelers, heeding government warnings and their own worries, are increasingly wary about visiting the region, prompting waves of cancellations.

Local tour operators fear what a protracted war would do to a promising and growing industry.

“We foresaw the Middle East evolving into the ‘New Europe’ with the Iran-Saudi Arabia rapprochement and Saudi Arabia’s integration into the tourism system,” said Khaled Ibrahim, a Cairo-based consultant for Amisol Travel Egypt and a member of the Middle East Travel Alliance. “We all hope that this war does not escalate and shatter the hopes that people — Arabs, Israelis and Iranians alike — have been holding onto.” Amisol Travel in Egypt has received only 40 to 50 percent of its typical bookings, he said, for the months between February and September 2024.

Hussein Abdallah, general manager of Lebanon Tours and Travels in Beirut, believes that “all of Lebanon is 100 percent safe,” but said he hasn’t had a single booking since the war started, prematurely ending a “very good year” for the tour business. Now, he said, tourist sites like the Jeita Grotto and the Baalbek Temples, a UNESCO World Heritage site, that normally receive thousands of visitors daily, are empty."

The group included a few relatives of people who had already been released.

Here’s what we know about the Israeli hostages released on Wednesday.

Ra’aya Rotem, 54

Ra’aya Rotem, 54, her daughter, Hila, 12, and her daughter’s friend Emily Hand, 9, were hiding in her family’s safe room in Kibbutz Be’eri on the morning of Oct. 7, before they were kidnapped. Ra’aya texted her brother around noon, telling him that she and her daughter were being taken, according to The Times of Israel.

On Saturday, Hila was released from Hamas captivity without her mother, an apparent breach of the agreement between Israel and Hamas that children would be released with mothers, according to Israeli officials.

Hila told her relatives that she and her mother had been together for most of the time that they were in captivity, and that they were only separated two days before Hila was released, according to a report in The Times of Israel.

Itay Regev, 18

Itay and his sister Maya, 21, were at the Tribe of Nova music festival in Re’im on Oct. 7, when Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostage. The siblings tried to escape together and were captured and taken captive in Gaza.

Maya, who sustained a gunshot injury to her leg, was released on Saturday, without her brother.

Raz Ben-Ami, 56

Raz Ben-Ami was kidnapped by Hamas from the Be’eri kibbutz on Oct. 7.

When she was taken hostage, Ms. Ben-Ami was being treated for neurosarcoidosis, a serious and rare disease that affects the brain, spinal cord or peripheral nerves, and has caused lesions to develop in her brain and spine.

Her medication suppresses the immune system, making her susceptible to infections, and her physicians said that they feared she would not survive in captivity for long.

Ms. Ben-Ami has had the disease for 13 years. Family members said that while the condition is painful, she has not complained and has maintained a positive attitude. She is an amateur artist, and enjoys beading, macramé and making jewelry. She recently started volunteering to do arts and crafts with older adults on the kibbutz.

Her husband Ohad, who was kidnapped with her, remains a hostage in Gaza.

Gali Tarshansky, 13

Gali Tarshansky, 13, was kidnapped alone on Oct. 7 from her home in Be’eri, a kibbutz near the Gazan border. Her brother Lior, 16, who was hiding with her, was murdered, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.

Ms. Tarshansky is a volleyball player on the Hapoel Ashkelon team and an animal lover, her family said. She also loves dancing, music and Marvel movies.

Her mother, Reuma, voiced her concern over her daughter’s safety at an event in Tel Aviv, Reuters reported, where other relatives of women and young girls held hostage urged women’s rights groups to push for the release of their loved ones.

Her grandmother, Kamelia Hoter Ishay, said on Tuesday she was fearful that the deal would collapse.

“The only thing I am waiting for is the phone call from my daughter, Reuma, who will say, ‘Gali is coming back,’” she said on Tuesday, Reuters reported. “And then I’ll know that it’s really over and I can breathe a sigh of relief.”

Yarden Roman-Gat, 36

Yarden Roman Gat, a physiotherapist who lived on Kibbutz Be’eri, was forced into a car commandeered by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, along with her husband, Alon, and 3-year-old daughter, Gefen, according to an account in The Times of Israel.

As the car approached the border with Gaza, the family spotted an Israeli tank and used the opportunity to jump out of the car. As they started running, Ms. Gat handed her daughter to her husband. The gunmen pursued them, shooting in their direction.

Ms. Gat was eventually captured and taken hostage, but her husband and daughter managed to evade the terrorists by hiding under bushes, taking cover for 12 hours, according to The Times of Israel account.

Liat Binin Atzili, 49

Liat Binin Atzili and her husband, Aviv Atzili, were kidnapped from their home on Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7.

Liat, a dual citizen of the United States and Israel, is a mother of three adult children and an educator, who also works as a tour guide for youth groups at Yad Vashem, the holocaust remembrance center in Jerusalem. She has traveled extensively in India, and enjoys nature and wildlife. Her husband remains in captivity.

Moran Stela Yanai, a self-employed artist and jewelry designer from Be’er Sheva, had gone to the Nova music festival in Re’im to sell her handmade jewelry, according to the hostages and missing families forum.

Ms. Yanai contacted her family while trying to escape by car with a friend after the attack started. Friends who survived told Ms. Yanai’s relatives that, after the telephone call, the group encountered another gang of terrorists. Her friends fled in different directions, losing touch with Ms. Yanai.

Liam Or, a kindergarten teacher in Kibbutz Be’eri, was taken hostage at the home of his uncle. He is a chess champion and an ardent supporter of the Hapoel Tel Aviv soccer team.

His uncle, Dror Or, and his cousins, Noam, 17, and Alma, 13, were taken hostage at the same time. Noam and Alma were released on Saturday. The Or family believes that Dror is being held in Gaza.

Ofir Engel, a high school student from Jerusalem, was visiting his girlfriend, Yuval Sharabi, 17, at Kibbutz Be’eri on Oct. 7 when he was kidnapped by Hamas militants.

He was taken hostage along with his girlfriend’s father, Yossi Sharabi.

Amit Shani, 16

When Hamas terrorists entered the safe room of Amit Shani’s house on Kibbutz Be’eri just after noon on Oct. 7, the 16-year-old tried to resist, his mother, Tal Shani, said in an interview last month.



“I said, ‘Don’t! Don’t! We have only our hands and they have guns! They will shoot you!’” Ms. Shani recalled. The gunmen ordered Ms. Shani, Amit and his two younger sisters to march down a road. Amit and two Israeli men from another house were ordered into a car, Ms. Shani said.

“I was begging and crying and begging to leave him alone and take me,” Ms. Shani said. One of the kidnappers, she said, raised his gun toward her. She and her two younger daughters were left behind and were rescued by Israeli soldiers later that night. The army later confirmed that Amit had been kidnapped.

“I don’t know how we survived it,” she said. “It’s like a nightmare movie.”"
150,150,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/briefing/polling-gaza.html,"A major reason appears to be the civilian death toll in Gaza, which is mostly women and children. More than 80 percent of Americans told Ipsos (in a poll for Reuters conducted a couple weeks ago) that Israel should pause military operations, as it since has, to allow humanitarian aid to reach Gazans.

3. Public opinion isn’t always consistent.

Consider these two facts: One, most Americans say that Israel’s military response has been both reasonable and understandable. In the Ipsos poll, for instance, 76 percent of people agreed that “Israel is doing what any country would do in response to a terror attack and the taking of civilian hostages.”

Two, most Americans say they favor an end to the fighting. They support not only a humanitarian pause but also a full cease-fire. In the YouGov poll, the margin favoring a cease-fire was 65 percent to 16 percent. In the Ipsos poll, 68 percent of people agreed that “Israel should call a cease-fire and try to negotiate.”

This combination of views doesn’t quite mesh. A full cease-fire would amount to a defeat for Israel and a victory for Hamas, with Hamas’s leaders able to claim the Oct. 7 attacks as a major success. Still, you can understand why many Americans would hold this mix of views: They both support Israel’s effort to topple Hamas and do not want Palestinians to keep dying. Poll questions don’t always ask people to make consistent choices.

I encourage readers to avoid the temptation to focus on only one of these two patterns — the support for a cease-fire or for Israel’s military actions — and to ignore the other one. Yes, only one of the two findings is convenient to each side in the debate, but both findings are real."
151,151,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/world/middleeast/west-bank-hamas-prisoners.html,"Anwar and his cousin, Mourad Atta, 17, are among the 180 Palestinian teenagers and women freed from Israeli prisons in recent days, the largest such release of prisoners and detainees in more than a decade. Their freedom is part of a deal in which the Palestinians were traded for 81 hostages, many of them children, captured during the Hamas-led terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7. The deal also included a temporary cease-fire in the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 13,000 people, according to Gazan officials.

Israel’s bombardment of Gaza and the elation over the prisoners’ release have deepened support for Hamas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority has administered cities and towns for more than two decades. Gaza, the other Palestinian enclave, has by contrast been controlled since 2007 by Hamas, a militant group.

Now, as many in the West Bank fear the war could spread to the occupied territory, some believe Hamas and other armed groups are the only ones they can trust to protect them.

The Palestinian Authority — which is controlled by the Fatah political faction — is deeply unpopular and widely seen as a subcontractor to the Israeli occupation. Long-simmering frustrations with the authority’s leadership and accusations of corruption have been exacerbated in the past year by an uptick in violence by Israeli settlers.

For some Palestinians living under military occupation in the West Bank, the freed prisoners have become a potent symbol of Hamas’s ability to achieve tangible results and its willingness to fight for the Palestinian cause. Each night in Ramallah, as new batches of prisoners were released, one refrain echoed across the crowds: “The people want Hamas! The people want Hamas!”"

153,153,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/us/politics/cia-director-qatar-hostage-talks.html,"William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, arrived in Doha, Qatar, on Tuesday for a new round of negotiations aimed at freeing more hostages held in Gaza, according to U.S. officials.

Mr. Burns and David Barnea, the head of the Mossad, Israel’s spy service, met with Gen. Abbas Kamel, the head of Egypt’s intelligence service, and Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani, the prime minister of Qatar.

Both Egypt and Qatar have had prominent roles in the hostage talks. Qatar hosts Hamas’s political leadership in Doha. And Qatari officials in recent days have been speaking with Hamas representatives about how to potentially expand the hostage releases, according to an official briefed on the talks.

Qatar announced on Monday that Israel and Hamas had agreed to extend a pause in fighting for two additional days to exchange more hostages and prisoners and to allow more aid to come into Gaza.

One U.S. official said Mr. Burns’s talks in Qatar would be meant to build on that agreement.

U.S. officials have been deeply involved in pushing for a deal to release hostages taken during the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7. Mr. Burns traveled to Doha on Nov. 9 as he and Mr. Barnea held talks with Qatari officials who have been working on the issue.

Hamas and Israel finally reached a deal on Nov. 21, and exchanges began later that week. During the first four days of the truce, 50 Israelis or dual nationals were released under the framework of the deal, and an additional 19 hostages — 17 Thais, one Filipino and one Russian-Israeli dual citizen — were released through separate negotiations. In exchange for the release of the Israelis and dual nationals, Israel paused its military campaign in Gaza, allowed more aid to flow into the enclave and released some Palestinian prisoners."
154,154,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/world/middleeast/bibas-family-israel-gaza.html,"Concern for members of the Bibas family — a mother and her two young children who have become symbols of the hostages held in Gaza — deepened on Wednesday afternoon when Hamas’s armed wing, the Al Qassam Brigades, claimed the three had been killed in Israeli airstrikes.

The claim could not be independently verified. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military’s chief spokesman, said it was assessing the accuracy of the Hamas statement, and on Israeli television, Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet, said the claims could be part of Hamas’s “psychological warfare.”

The Bibas family said in a statement that they hoped the claims would be “refuted by military officials,” and thanked the Israeli public for its support.

The three — Shiri Bibas, 32; Ariel Bibas, 4; and Kfir Bibas, 10 months old — were among the roughly 240 people taken hostage by Hamas and other groups on Oct. 7. Shiri Bibas, terror painted across her face, appeared in footage filmed by the gunmen at Kibbutz Nir Oz as she held her two red-haired children close to her chest. Shiri’s husband, Yarden Bibas, was also kidnapped, and could be seen in one video, bloodied, as he was placed on a truck headed into Gaza.

Ariel has been described as a little boy who loves toy tractors and cars. Kfir, the youngest hostage in Gaza, was just starting to eat solid foods.

Worries about the family were already high. The initial cease-fire, a four-day pause in hostilities, included an agreement that at least 50 women and children would be exchanged for 150 Palestinian women and children imprisoned in Israeli jails. With each day of the hostage release, concern for the family has grown as it became clear that they were not on the list of people being freed.

On Wednesday morning, Yifat Zailer, Ms. Bibas’s cousin, described waiting for the lists of hostages set to be freed as “this horrible mathematical equation.”

“Our hearts skip a beat every time,” Ms. Zailer said. “It’s really hard to breathe.”

When the cease-fire was extended on Monday, Ms. Zailer found herself losing a sense of time. She didn’t understand why her family members had yet to be released, how decisions were being made or whether they were being held for leverage.

On Monday, Admiral Hagari said the Bibas family was being held not by Hamas, but by other armed groups in Gaza. But, he said, the responsibility for the hostages is “solely that of Hamas,” which controls the territory. Avichay Adraee, another spokesman for the Israeli military, said the family was being held in the Khan Younis area in southern Gaza.

The family had already been through what Ms. Zailer called “a twisted reality from hell.” Her aunt and uncle, Yosi Silberman and Margit Silberman Schnaider, were killed in the Oct. 7 assault.

On Tuesday night, a group gathered in honor of the Bibas boys and released orange balloons in the Tel Aviv sky once it became clear that they would not be freed that evening.

Ms. Zailer said through tears that she wanted to imagine the orange balloons reaching the sky over Gaza so Shiri could see “that we are waiting for her and we are doing everything we can.”"
155,155,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/us/politics/israel-iran-gaza-us-attacks.html,"Neither Washington nor Tehran wants the conflict in the Gaza Strip to trigger a wider war in the region, officials in both capitals say.

But in the seven weeks since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, Iranian-backed militias have launched more than 70 rocket and drone attacks against U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria. The Pentagon, for its part, has responded with four rounds of airstrikes, killing as many as 15 people, U.S. officials say.

National security officials fear a miscalculation amid tit-for-tat attacks, combined with each side’s belief that the other does not want a larger fight, could trigger exactly that: a regional conflict, just two years after the United States ended 20 years of war in the Middle East and South Asia.

So far, none of the U.S. reprisal attacks have provoked an escalation, even the one last week in Iraq that killed several militants with Kataib Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed group. The Pentagon said on Tuesday that the attacks had subsided at least temporarily — the most recent being on Nov. 23, the day before an operational pause in the Gaza war began."
156,156,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/world/europe/paris-1919-historys-slingshot.html,"It feels urgent to revisit the events of early 20th century Europe right now. Reading about that era feels like watching someone draw back the slingshot whose energy still propels much of modern politics, including the conflict in Gaza and Israel.

“Paris 1919,” by Margaret MacMillan, traces the negotiations of the Paris peace conference, which eventually led to the Treaty of Versailles. Although that agreement is now best known for the burdensome reparations it imposed on Germany, creating resentments that Hitler fanned and exploited in his rise to power, MacMillan does a good job of explaining the misguided idealism that guided negotiators as they redrew the map of Europe, carving nation-states out of collapsing empires.

Some of the negotiators had the foresight to see the disastrous consequences of their actions, but no ability to stop them. Robert Lansing, Woodrow Wilson’s secretary of state, predicted that the promise of national self-determination that was used to justify many of the new states’ borders “will raise hopes which can never be realized. It will, I fear, cost thousands of lives. In the end it is bound to be discredited, to be called the dream of an idealist who failed to realize the danger until it was too late to check those who attempt to put the principle into force.”

I picked up “Postwar,” by Tony Judt, after a historian friend texted to remind me of this quote in response to my newsletter a few weeks ago: “At the conclusion of the First World War, it was borders that were invented and adjusted, while people were on the whole left in place. After 1945 what happened was rather the opposite: boundaries stayed broadly intact and people were moved instead.”"
157,157,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/opinion/chuck-schumer-jews-antisemitism.html,"But many of my family members elsewhere met more tragic ends.

When I was a boy, I learned what happened when the Nazis invaded my family’s town in Ukraine. The Nazis ordered my great-grandmother to gather her extended family on the porch of her home. When the Nazis told her to come with them, she refused, and they gunned her down, along with 30 members of her family, from 85 years old to 3 months old.

When I heard the story of what Hamas and its allies did in Kibbutz Be’eri, where they killed more than 120 Jews, from the elderly to babies, it struck me on a deeply personal level.

Most Jewish Americans have similar stories — stories that we learned at a young age and will stay imprinted on our hearts for as long as we live.

We see and hear things differently from others because we understand the horrors that can follow the targeting of Jewish people. We’ve learned the hard way to fear how such attacks can easily erupt into widespread antisemitism if they are not repudiated. I am sure Arab Americans have similar fears when they see the rise in Islamophobia and horrific crimes like the gut-wrenching murder of the 6-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume.

Of course, criticizing the Israeli government is not inherently antisemitic. Over the years, I have vehemently disagreed with many of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s policies, especially his administration’s encouragement of settlements in the West Bank, gravely harming prospects for a two-state solution, which I support. I have also been among those who have said that Israel must act according to international law and that humanitarian assistance for Palestinians is critical."
158,158,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/us/politics/schumer-antisemitism-israel-hamas.html,"Mr. Schumer’s warning came as antisemitic hate crimes have skyrocketed and pro-Palestinian protests, some featuring antisemitic signs and slogans, have swelled across the country as the civilian death toll in Gaza has soared. Those events have fueled a bitter debate over the war and exposed a sharp divide in the Democratic Party.

Many progressives have taken up the Palestinian cause as an extension of the racial and social justice movements that have recently dominated Democratic politics, while more mainstream members of the party have continued to offer unequivocal backing for Israel’s actions and response to Hamas’s attack. That schism has also extended to the debate over whether additional military aid to Israel requested by President Biden should come with any strings attached, with a solid bloc of Democrats arguing the money should come with conditions.

But the vitriol against Israel and Jews in the United States, Mr. Schumer said on Wednesday, has crossed into widespread antisemitism, “the likes of which we haven’t seen for generations in this country — if ever.”

“Antisemites are taking advantage of the pro-Palestinian movement to espouse hatred and bigotry toward Jewish people,” Mr. Schumer said. “But rather than call out this dangerous behavior for what it is, we see so many of our friends and fellow citizens — particularly young people who yearn for justice — unknowingly aiding and abetting their cause.”

He spoke about the deep sense of betrayal, isolation and fear that he and many Jews have felt in witnessing the reaction of the left, people who he said “most liberal Jewish Americans felt previously were their ideological fellow travelers.”"

Moshe Leimberg, Gabriela’s husband and Mia’s father, stayed home in Jerusalem that day because he had the flu.

In a notice he posted on LinkedIn, Mr. Leimberg said that since Oct. 7, he had heard nothing from or about his wife and daughter. “Not a word, not a picture,” he wrote. “They just disappeared, leaving behind a few scattered personal effects, almost as if they never existed.”

Their absence, he said, “has left a gaping hole.”

Gabriela Leimberg is the manager of a day-care center for youth adults with autism. The organization, Shekel, has pleaded for the family’s release.

Mia Leimberg, who is known for her singing voice, has studied at the Jersualem High School of the Arts, and also worked at a bookshop, according to the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum. The family dog was taken with the family; on Tuesday, videos on local news outlets showed Mia carrying a dog as she approached the International Committee of the Red Cross vehicles.

Ditza Heiman, 84, was one of the first members of Kibbutz Nir Oz and had spent her entire adult life at the kibbutz, her son, Gideon Heiman, said at a news conference held by the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum earlier this month.

Ms. Heiman, who worked as a social worker, retired just before she turned 80, Mr. Heiman said. “She spent her whole life helping people and helping take care of people,” he said.

Ms. Heiman requires anticoagulant medication and suffered from a pulmonary embolism in the past, Dr. Sharon Kleitman, the family physician of Kibbutz Nir Oz, said at the same news conference.

“My mother is not a healthy woman, and she needs medicine,” Mr. Heiman said.

When the family tried to call Ms. Heiman on the day of the attack, someone picked up and said, “It’s Hamas,” her daughter, Neta Heiman, said in a video posted by the forum.

“When I envision my mother there, she’s taking care of everyone,” Ms. Heiman said in the video, adding: “That’s my mother. She’ll take care of everyone if she only can. If they only let her.”

“My mother, and many of her friends on Kibbutz Nir Oz who were massacred, were people of peace,” Neta Heiman said in an opinion piece in the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, adding, “All that my mother and her friends wanted was to live in peace in the small Eden they had built there in the desert.”

There were children forced to appear in hostage videos, and others forced to watch gruesome footage of Hamas’s Oct. 7 terrorist attack. They bore physical and psychological wounds.

As some hostages captured that day in the Hamas-led assault on southern Israel have been released, they have relayed these and other stories of their captivity to family members. While their individual experiences differ in some details, their accounts share features that corroborate one another and suggest that Hamas and its allies planned to take hostages.

The New York Times interviewed the family members of 10 freed hostages, who spoke on behalf of their relatives to relay sensitive information.

The relatives who spoke to The Times described how the freed hostages, many of them children, were deprived of adequate food while in Gaza. Many said they had received just a single piece of bread per day for weeks. Others were fed small portions of rice, or pieces of cheese. The Red Cross said it was denied access to the hostages."

President Biden’s guests did not try to hide their anguish.

Just weeks after the start of the Israel-Hamas war, Mr. Biden had invited a small group of prominent Muslim Americans to the White House to discuss Islamophobia in America. The participants were blunt with him, according to four people who were in attendance.

They told him that his embrace of Israel after the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks was seen by many as permission for Israel’s bombing in Gaza. They said the president’s statement casting doubt on the death toll among Palestinians was insulting. And they said the fatal stabbing of a 6-year-old Muslim boy outside Chicago was just one devastating result of the dehumanization of their community.

The private meeting, which had been scheduled for 30 minutes, stretched to more than an hour, attendees said. Mr. Biden waved off aides who tried to pull him out of the room as he listened to the criticism and shared his own experience with loss and grief."

They walked for hours, raising their hands when they encountered Israeli troops with guns trained on them to display their I.D. cards — or wave white rags. All around them was the sound of gunfire and the incessant buzzing of drones. Bodies littered rubble-filled streets.

For the tens of thousands of Gazans who have fled the northern part of the enclave where the heaviest fighting has been taking place, evacuating to the south has been a perilous journey, according to at least 10 Gazans that The New York Times spoke to on the ground and by phone. Even though a tenuous cease-fire in place since Friday has brought temporary relief from the bombardment, they face an uncertain future — and the threat the strikes will return, leaving them displaced yet again.

The Israeli military launched a deadly bombing campaign of the Gaza Strip after an attack on Israel by Hamas on Oct. 7 in which, Israeli officials say, 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage. In the seven weeks since, Israel has pounded the tiny coastal enclave with the aim of destroying Hamas’s military capabilities. So far, more than 13,000 Palestinians have been killed as of Nov. 21, according to the Gazan health authorities.

For weeks, Israel has been urging Gazans living in northern towns to flee along Salah al-Din Street, the strip’s main north-south highway."
163,163,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/world/middleeast/ahed-tamimi-detained-israel.html,"It was around 4 a.m. when Nariman Tamimi’s daughter, Ahed, roused her from sleep and told her that Israeli soldiers had surrounded their home in the occupied West Bank.

Nariman Tamimi had been expecting the raid: Over the previous week, an online campaign had vilified her daughter as a terrorist and demanded Ahed’s arrest. But the expectation did little to dull her terror on Nov. 6, when more than a dozen soldiers ransacked their home and hauled Ahed away in handcuffs.

Ahed Tamimi, 22, is one of the highest-profile Palestinians arrested by Israel since Oct. 7, as it has conducted a sweeping campaign of raids and detentions that it says is aimed at deterring terrorist attacks but has also prompted alarm from international human rights groups.

On Sunday, after holding Ms. Tamimi for nearly three weeks without access to a lawyer or her family, Israel moved to incarcerate her under administrative detention, according to her lawyer, Mahmoud Hassan. She now faces indefinite imprisonment, without charges or trial, based on evidence that neither she nor her lawyer are allowed to view.

Israel’s expansive use of administrative detention has been widely criticized as a violation of international law. The detentions, which Israel maintains are a preventative and necessary security measure, are typically upheld by the Israeli military court system and can be renewed indefinitely. The use of administrative detentions had hit a 30-year high even before the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, human rights groups say.

“I’m hopeless to defend her,” Mr. Hassan said.

Hours after Ms. Tamimi’s hearing, her name appeared on an Israeli government list of Palestinian prisoners and detainees who could be released as part of a hostage exchange with Hamas. The news brought little comfort to Nariman Tamimi, who said the Israeli military’s ban on celebrations and threats to arrest her other children had made her unwilling to speak publicly.

“All of our lives we speak up and we’re not afraid,” Nariman Tamimi said. “But now we’re at a point where the situation is extremely dire.”

The Israeli military has said Ms. Tamimi was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence and calling for terrorist activity, but has declined to provide further information. Her mother said the arrest was based on a post to an Instagram account in her name that referenced Hitler and vowed to “slaughter” settlers in the West Bank.

Her family has denied that she wrote the post, saying her account had been hacked months ago and that she is frequently impersonated online.

Ms. Tamimi comes from a family of prominent Palestinian activists and has protested the Israeli occupation of their village of Nabi Saleh for much of her life. Her father, Bassem Tamimi, a longtime activist, was also detained, on Oct. 29, and has been placed in the West Bank’s Ofer Prison under administrative detention for six months.

Ms. Tamimi made headlines as a child for physically confronting Israeli forces, who have wounded, imprisoned and killed many of her relatives. A video of one such episode, in which she slapped an Israeli soldier, went viral and transformed Ms. Tamimi into an international symbol of Palestinian resistance.

She subsequently served an eight-month sentence and spent her 17th birthday in jail. Her memoir, “They Called Me a Lioness: A Palestinian Girl’s Fight for Freedom,” was published by an imprint of Random House in 2022.

The Israeli military estimates that it has arrested 1,800 people in the occupied West Bank since Oct. 7. But the crackdown, coupled with escalating reports of violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers, has left the West Bank in an “alarming and urgent” situation with “multilayered human rights violations,” the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has warned.

The Palestinian Prisoners Society, a nongovernmental rights group, gives an even higher estimate for the number of detentions since Oct. 7 — more than 3,000 — and says the arrests have been accompanied by abuse of the detainees, threats against their families and, often, damage to their homes. Ms. Tamimi was beaten during her arrest, and then transferred from the West Bank to a prison in Israel, where she was beaten again, her lawyer, Mr. Hassan, said.

PEN International, a writers’ association that defends freedom of expression, has demanded the immediate release of Ms. Tamimi and “all Palestinians who have been languishing in unjust imprisonment for years, many of whom are children.”

“Administrative detention is inherently arbitrary,” the association’s head of the Middle East and North Africa region, Mina Thabet, said in a statement. “This form of detention has been systematically used by the Israeli authorities to subjugate and silence Palestinians, including writers, for decades,” he added.

Top officials from Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. were pushing to lock in another extension of the cease-fire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, which is set to expire today.

Officials see it as the best way to ease the humanitarian crisis, secure the release of more hostages and slow the war’s death toll. But officials with knowledge of the talks said they also hoped that the succession of short-term pauses would pave the way to ending the war.

One of those people said that mediators expect that the longer the cease-fire lasts, the more difficult it will be for Israel to restart its offensive and reach southern Gaza, where senior Hamas leaders are believed to be hiding.

Here’s the latest.

A senior Israeli official said there were currently no negotiations aimed at a long-term cease-fire or an exchange involving all the remaining hostages for all the prisoners. Israel has vowed not to stop its offensive until Hamas’s leadership is eradicated and its military and governance systems are uprooted from Gaza. Members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government are threatening to bring it down if he does not restart the fighting."

Two facts loom over the COP28 U.N. climate talks, which begin tomorrow in Dubai: Earth is careening toward climate disaster, and governments are acting too slowly to avert it.

Diplomats from nearly 200 countries, and many heads of state and government, will gather to try to draft a plan to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. The United Arab Emirates, the world’s fifth-largest oil producer, is hosting COP28, drawing the anger of activists. The conference is taking place against a backdrop of wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, making international cooperation even more difficult.

For some insight, I reached out to my colleague Lisa Friedman, who is covering the annual conference for the 12th time.

What will you be watching this time around?

Lisa: There are a number of important things set to take place, including a global assessment of how successful nations have been in meeting the climate targets they set in Paris in 2015; and finalizing the details of a new fund to help vulnerable countries cope with the loss and damage caused by global warming. But the big thing I’ll have my eye on is the political agreement nations are debating around phasing out fossil fuels. Fossil fuel burning is the main driver of climate change, but so far nations have been unwilling to collectively call for a phase-out."
168,168,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/us/politics/biden-israel-hamas-hostages.html,"After seven weeks of struggling with a crisis that defies easy solutions, President Biden could take solace in saving a single 4-year-old girl whose parents were killed in the Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel.

But gratifying as it was to secure the release of Avigail Idan from her Hamas captors over the weekend, the challenge for Mr. Biden going forward is not only to free the rest of the Americans being held hostage but to use the success of recent days to alter the trajectory of the war consuming Gaza.

At the president’s urging, the two sides agreed on Monday to extend the temporary pause in the war between Israel and Hamas two more days to allow the release of an additional 20 hostages, according to Qatar, the Persian Gulf emirate that has been serving as intermediary. That gives all sides more breathing space but only postpones the most critical question by another 48 hours — namely what happens whenever the negotiated pause eventually expires.

Israel has vowed to resume its withering assault on Hamas once the hostage releases end, and Mr. Biden has said repeatedly that the country has a right to defend itself after a terrorist attack that killed an estimated 1,200 people. At the same time, the president hopes to influence any fresh military action, ensuring that it is more targeted and does more to avoid civilian casualties. The White House has already warned Israel against moving into southern Gaza, where many Palestinians living in the coastal enclave have fled, without a concrete plan to protect civilians.

“Biden’s in a bind,” said Aaron David Miller, a longtime Middle East negotiator now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “He’s tethered himself to Israel’s war aims — eradicating Hamas. But in view of the rising humanitarian catastrophe and the exponential rise in Palestinian deaths, he’s looking for ways to de-escalate and eventually for an exit ramp.”

“Freeing hostages is one way to try and extend the truce, get aid into Gaza and hostages out,” Mr. Miller added. “But there’s a moment of decision coming when Israel seeks to resume its ground campaign. Will he press Israel to stop or at least try to shape its operations in the south?”"

On the first day of the U.N.’s COP28 talks, diplomats from nearly 200 countries approved a draft plan for a fund to help vulnerable countries hit by climate disasters, which are made worse by pollution spewed by wealthy nations.

For more than three decades, developing nations have pressed for compensation from wealthier, more industrialized countries to help with the costs of destructive storms, heat waves and droughts fueled by global warming. The fund has been widely viewed as a positive sign for the two-week summit in Dubai, and is expected to be up and running this year.

Among the nations contributing, the United Arab Emirates and Germany each pledged $100 million, while the U.K. pledged about $76 million and Japan said it would give $10 million. The E.U. climate commissioner said the union would contribute at least around $245 million. The U.S. promised $17.5 million, an amount that some activists criticized as too low for the world’s largest economy.

While the initial pledges add up to about $549 million, climate-related damages are expected to cost developing countries between $280 billion and $580 billion per year by 2030."

Israel and Hamas agreed yesterday to extend their fragile truce for two more days, according to officials in Qatar who helped negotiate the initial cease-fire.

The deal could allow for additional aid to flow into Gaza and the release of more hostages, prisoners and detainees than initially expected. The extension came before the four-day truce was set to expire today. Israeli officials signaled that a fourth exchange of hostages and prisoners, the final round of the initial agreement, would proceed.

Here’s the latest.

The head of the State Information Service in Egypt, which is also mediating the talks between Israel and Hamas, said yesterday that a two-day extension would include the daily release of 10 women and children being held hostage in Gaza in exchange for 30 Palestinian detainees being held in Israeli prisons.

It is not clear whether the idea will survive an intensive round of negotiations to finalize the national security spending measure, which could reach the Senate floor as soon as next week.

But the fact that senators in both parties are coalescing around the move — and that the Biden administration has signaled openness to it — highlights the political potency of concerns about the southern border. Republicans have sought to weaponize the issue against President Biden and his party, and with polls showing voters deeply critical of the president’s border policies, he and many other Democrats are eager to insulate themselves.

The emerging consensus to change asylum policy has alarmed liberals on Capitol Hill, particularly Latino lawmakers, who have privately expressed their grave concerns to both administration officials and Senate leaders."
173,173,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/opinion/war-israel-gaza-tigray.html,"The two bloodiest wars of the past two years have been results of tragic miscalculations. A third war, which has dominated the news lately, might also have been set in motion by a costly mistake, as I’ll explain. To economists, this raises a question: If wars are so awful, why do we keep blundering into them?

First, the data. The wars that cost the most lives in 2022 were in Ethiopia and Ukraine. Battle-related deaths exceeded 100,000 in the Tigray region of Ethiopia and 81,000 in Ukraine, according to the Peace Research Institute Oslo. Those conflicts drove battle-related deaths for the world as a whole to a 28-year high of 237,000, the institute says. Believe it or not, 2023 is peaceful by comparison.

The war that’s in the news now is the Hamas terror attack on Israelis on Oct. 7 and the Israel Defense Forces counterattack, which it says is necessary to root Hamas out of Gaza. Hamas murdered about 1,200 Israelis in the first attack. Nearly 400 Israeli soldiers, officers and reservists have been killed then and in subsequent fighting, according to the I.D.F. Gazan officials estimate that more than 14,000 people have died in the counterattack, of whom they say about 10,000 were women and children. (That’s a lower bound for the estimated number of civilian deaths.) There’s also been deadly fighting in the West Bank.

There’s a plausible argument that each war would not have occurred but for someone’s terrible miscalculation. In the contested Tigray region of Ethiopia, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front attacked an Ethiopian Army post in 2020, “probably in an attempt to negotiate a better deal” with the central government, Eli Berman, an economist who studies war at the University of California, San Diego, told me. If that’s the case, things didn’t go as planned. Instead of negotiating, the government chose to fight it out. There were spasms of heavy fighting from November 2020 to November 2022, charges of war crimes by both sides and famine."
174,174,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/26/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hamas-hostages.html,"A third group of Gaza Strip hostages, including a 4-year-old American girl whose parents were killed in the Hamas raids on Israel, was freed on Sunday, raising the prospect more captives could be set free and a fragile truce extended.

She marked her fourth birthday in captivity in Gaza on Friday.

“Thank God she’s home,” President Biden said to reporters in Nantucket, Mass., where he spent the Thanksgiving holiday. “I wish I was there to hold her.”

Much hinged on the latest release of hostages, who were exchanged for 39 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel on the third day of a four-day truce."

As she starred in films like “Bull Durham,” “Thelma & Louise” and “Dead Man Walking,” for which she won an Academy Award, she became a familiar, outspoken figure who appeared at rallies, took stances on issues at awards shows and made political endorsements. Over the years her brand of progressive politics led to clashes with others on the left, most notably in 2016, when she decided to back a Green Party candidate over Hillary Clinton, who went on to lose to Donald J. Trump.

But her politics did not appear to have much impact on her career until last week, when Ms. Sarandon, 77, was dropped by United Talent Agency after she spoke at a pro-Palestinian rally in New York held amid the Israel-Hamas war and said, “There are a lot of people that are afraid, afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country, so often subjected to violence.”

Her remarks, first reported by The New York Post, struck a nerve at a moment when Hollywood was being divided by the war. Some in the industry were expressing alarm about rising antisemitism and felt that their community had not sufficiently expressed support for Israel after Hamas fighters killed about 1,200 Israelis and took more than 200 captive on Oct. 7. But questions were also being raised about if and when political speech should affect a career, as others in the industry lost positions and acting jobs after criticizing Israel for killing thousands of civilians in Gaza."

The deal offered a glimmer of hope to the father, Ziad Dawoud, 53, who had not seen his son for nearly a year since he was arrested for throwing stones at Israeli soldiers during a raid in their neighborhood, he said. Israeli authorities say that his son was arrested in connection with his affiliation with Hamas, according to a list of prisoners published by the Israeli government.

Then late Saturday afternoon, his son’s name, Tariq Dawoud, flashed across the screen among a list of prisoners expected to be released that day. Mr. Dawoud jumped in his car and raced from their hometown, Qalqiliya, a city in a northwestern area of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, around two hours to Ramallah, where hundreds waited outside of Ofer prison for their release.

Crowds have gathered each evening for days in Ramallah to welcome the Palestinian prisoners and detainees who have been released in exchange for hostages held by Hamas. Tariq Dawoud was among the second group, which was announced on Saturday.

An additional 39 Palestinians in custody were freed on Sunday, according to Israel’s prison service. After their release, hundreds of people crowded around them, hoisting them in the air and carrying them toward a main square in Ramallah.

A feeling of sheer relief washed over Mr. Dawoud as his son stepped off the bus of prisoners early Sunday morning, he said. The two hugged and the younger Dawoud went to kiss his father’s feet in a sign of respect, but his father refused to let him.

“I told him: ‘Oh my son, my love,’” the father recalled in a phone interview.

The two drove back to Qalqiliya, both still in disbelief. When they arrived at their house at dawn, dozens of relatives and friends rushed to greet the younger Dawoud. Then, they said, they paraded him around the neighborhood in a 15-car motorcade, honking their horns and shouting to announce his triumphant return.

“I couldn’t believe it, I felt like I was dreaming,” the younger Dawoud said in a phone interview Sunday evening.

The announcement from Hamas came on the third day of a four-day truce between Israel and Hamas to facilitate the release of hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Israel has vowed it will continue its military campaign in the enclave after the truce is scheduled to end on Tuesday morning, with its primary goal being the destruction of Hamas.

On Sunday morning the military wing of Hamas, the Qassam Brigades, issued a brief statement saying that Abu Anas al-Ghandour, who led the group’s fighters in northern Gaza, and three other commanders had been killed. It did not provide further details on when or where they had died.

The Israeli military said earlier this month — before the truce began — that it had targeted Mr. al-Ghandour in a strike on Hamas’s underground infrastructure, but did not say at the time whether he was dead or alive.

On Sunday, the Israeli military said in a statement that it had killed Mr. al-Ghandour “prior to the operational pause” in fighting, calling him a “leading figure in the planning and execution” of the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks on Israel. The military also confirmed it had killed the three other commanders Hamas named in its statement — Aiman Siam, Wael Rajeb and Rafet Salman.

A number of other Hamas officials and commanders are believed to have been killed since Israel launched a war in retaliation for the group’s Oct. 7 attacks, which killed an estimated 1,200 people in southern Israel and led to the abduction of roughly 240 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.

Mr. al-Ghandour was the most senior commander that Hamas has confirmed dead since the group’s announcement last month that Ayman Nofal, a member of its General Military Council and the commander of the Central Brigade in the Qassam Brigades, had been killed.

The State Department put Mr. al-Ghandour under U.S. sanctions in 2017, saying that he had been “involved in many terrorist operations” — including a 2006 attack that killed two Israeli soldiers and led to the kidnapping of another, Gilad Shalit.

Mr. Shalit was released in October 2011 in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. One of those freed in the deal, Yahya Sinwar, eventually became Hamas’s leader in Gaza and, according to Israeli officials, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attacks."
180,180,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/26/world/middleeast/pirates-central-park-aden-navy.html,"The five gunmen who attacked a chemical tanker in the Gulf of Aden on Sunday and were later captured by the U.S. Navy were Somali pirates, American officials said Monday.

The five were in the custody of the U.S. Navy and were being questioned, U.S. officials said. The officials said the Somali pirates had no apparent connection to Iran or to Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are supported by Tehran.

More than 16 hours after the attempted takeover of the tanker, two ballistic missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen toward the site of the attempted hijacking, though the missiles landed 10 nautical miles away from the U.S.S. Mason, the ship that responded to the attempted piracy and captured the gunmen.

A U.S. official said that episode was still being investigated to see if it was an opportunistic attack by Houthi rebels or if the missile strike was unrelated.

The U.S.S. Mason, and other ships from the U.S.-led counter-piracy task force that operates off the coast of Somalia, responded Sunday morning after the crew of the commercial ship, the Central Park, called for help. The Central Park crew reported they were under attack from an unknown entity, U.S. Central Command said Sunday.

When the coalition vessels arrived at the Central Park, they demanded the release of the ship. Five armed people fled from the ship and attempted to flee in the small boat they had used to attack the cargo ship. The U.S.S. Mason pursued the attackers and forced them to surrender, the news release said.

Regional tensions have intensified since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel. But after their initial questioning of the captured gunmen, U.S. officials concluded that the attack on Sunday was unrelated to the conflict.

Complicating the initial assessment was the fact that Houthi rebels attacked several commercial vessels last week in the Red Sea,which connects to the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis and other groups backed by Iran, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, have increased attacks on Israel since Oct. 7.

But Sunday’s attack in the Gulf of Aden took place well away from where the Houthis operate.

Somali pirates have been a hazard to international shipping for nearly 20 years. Protecting commercial shipments from such attacks is why the U.S. helped create the international coalition of navies that patrol a shipping corridor in the Gulf of Aden.

Zodiac Maritime, the London-based company that manages the vessel, said that the ship and crew are now safe and unharmed but provided few further details. Zodiac Maritime is led by Eyal Ofer, an Israeli-born shipping magnate."

The move came after an initial release of 13 Israelis on Friday followed by 13 additional Israelis late on Saturday.

Here’s what we know about the Israeli citizens released on Sunday.

Avigail Idan, 4

Avigail’s parents, Roy Idan, 43, and Smadar Idan, 38, were killed in Kfar Aza during the Oct. 7 attack. Her two siblings Michael, 9, and Amelia, 6, both survived.

Avigail, who is a dual Israeli and U.S. citizen, turned 4 years old while in captivity. Her name has also been spelled “Abigail” in the U.S. media. President Biden has discussed Avigail in his public remarks and expressed particular gratitude for her release when he spoke to reporters on Sunday before leaving for Washington from Nantucket, Mass., where he marked the Thanksgiving holiday.

Avigail’s uncle and aunt, Amit and Tal Idan, have been taking care of her siblings since the attack.

On the morning of Oct. 7, as terrorists swarmed the kibbutz, Smadar Idan was shot in front of her children, Tal Idan said she was told by Michael and Amelia. Roy Idan was outside the house, holding Avigail in his arms. As Michael and Amelia ran to their father, they watched him get shot and killed while holding their sister. They assumed she was also dead and raced back into their home.

Covered in her father’s blood, Avigail ran toward a neighbor, her aunt said. The man brought Avigail into his home to hide with his wife and children and then left the house to find a gun. “Ten minutes later, when he got back, all were gone,” Ms. Idan said.

After 14 hours of hiding in a closet with their mother’s body on the other side of a fabric partition, Michael and Amelia were rescued by an Israeli soldier and brought to their uncle, Ms. Idan said.

“They are not OK,” she said of Michael and Amelia. “They hear the wind blow, and they are shaking.”"

What to watch: The buzz and fears swirling around artificial intelligence, the rise of hate speech and antisemitism since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, China-U.S. relations, inflation, interest rates and the chip wars and streaming wars — these topics and more will be covered by Andrew as he interviews some of the biggest newsmakers in business, politics and culture.

There will be plenty of questions about an uncertain world. Americans are down on politics, the economy and workplace conditions. College campuses are divided. What role does business play in addressing these grievances? What about the White House and Congress? Can they bring voters together? Speaking of which, can Republicans unite to keep the government from shutting down again (and again)?

Elsewhere, can Beijing and Washington decrease tensions and restore more normalized trading relations? What about A.I.? Is this a technology that will unleash a new wave of productivity, or is it a force that could do irreparable harm? And what’s so special about colonizing Mars?"
183,183,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/26/world/middleeast/us-hostage-gaza-sullivan.html,"At least one American citizen could be among the group of hostages Hamas is set to release on Sunday, Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

“We do have reason to believe that there will be an American released today,” Mr. Sullivan said.

Israel and Hamas are halfway through a four-day pause in a war that began after Hamas assailants killed about 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7, including in their homes and at a music festival, kidnapping about 240 people.

Under an agreement that the United States helped broker with Qatar and Egypt, Hamas will return 50 hostages, all women and children, during the temporary cease-fire. Israel will release 150 Palestinian prisoners, many of whom were detained for violent crimes.

Over the past two days Hamas has returned 26 Israeli hostages, 14 Thai citizens and one citizen of the Philippines, all women and children. No Americans have yet been freed.

About 10 American citizens are thought to be held hostage by Hamas. They include Avigail Idan, whose parents were gunned down by Hamas. She turned 4 on Friday.

Mr. Biden praised the initial hostage release this past week and said the United States was committed to the return of all Americans.

“We also will not stop until we get these hostages brought home and an answer to their whereabouts,” he said.

Mr. Sullivan said he could not confirm if Avigail would be released on Sunday.

“At least one American will be released today. I cannot confirm who it will be, or that it will absolutely happen,” Mr. Sullivan said, adding that “we are dealing with a terrorist group.”

Mr. Sullivan sidestepped questions about whether Mr. Biden would seek to impose any conditions on further aid to Israel, including a freeze on Israeli settlements in the West Bank. But he said Mr. Biden was working toward a peace plan that includes a two-state solution.

“We believe that this is absolutely a moment for us to be working with everyone in the region,” Mr. Sullivan said. “We do think this is a moment for that kind of diplomacy.”"
184,184,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/26/world/middleeast/biden-israel-hamas-american-hostages.html,"President Biden on Sunday hailed the release of Avigail Idan, who turned 4 years old during her seven weeks in Hamas captivity and was the first American citizen to be freed by the group in recent days. The president vowed to keep working to secure freedom for others in captivity and extend the pause in the fighting.

“Thank God she’s home,” Mr. Biden told reporters in Nantucket, Mass., where he had been celebrating Thanksgiving. “I wish I was there to hold her.”

Avigail, whose name has been rendered as Abigail in American media, is a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen and was seized on Oct. 7 after Hamas fighters killed her parents. She was among the 17 people held captive who were turned over on Sunday as part of a temporary cease-fire deal.

Her case became the focus of widespread international attention and concern as she turned 4 on Friday. Mr. Biden said Avigail’s mother was killed in front of her when Hamas fighters stormed their kibbutz. The child then ran to her father, who was shot and killed while using his body to shield her, and she then ran to neighbors for help, Mr. Biden said. The family disappeared and Avigail was taken hostage.

“What she endured is unthinkable,” Mr. Biden said. He added that he did not have any immediate information about her condition but said that she was “safely in Israel.”

Liz Hirsh Naftali and Noa Naftali, Avigail’s great-aunt and cousin, said in a statement on Sunday that “there are no words to express our relief and gratitude” to the United States, Qatari government and other “informal actors” who worked to secure the release of hostages.

“Today’s release proves that it’s possible,” they wrote. “We can get all the hostages back home. We have to keep pushing.”

About 10 American citizens were unaccounted for and believed to be in Hamas captivity. Asked Sunday about the other American hostages, Mr. Biden said he was hopeful for their release but did not have concrete news about them.

Israel and Hamas are halfway through a four-day pause in a war that began after Hamas assailants massacred about 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7, including in their homes and at a music festival, and kidnapped about 240 people. Among those reported killed were 36 Americans.

Under the agreement, Hamas is expected to return 50 hostages during the temporary cease-fire. Israel will release 150 Palestinian prisoners, many of whom were detained for violent crimes.

Mr. Biden said the truce, which the United States helped broker with Qatar and Egypt, was not only resulting in the release of hostages but also the provision of more aid to civilians in Gaza, with 200 trucks of food, water, medicine, fuel and cooking gas arriving each day.

He said he hoped to extend the original deal so more captives could be freed and the hold on fighting could continue. The Israeli government has said it will extend the pause one day for every additional 10 hostages freed.

Mr. Biden said he would continue to work with the leaders of Israel, Egypt and Qatar “to do everything possible” to free the other hostages held by Hamas. He is scheduled to speak with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Sunday, White House officials said.

“More is needed, but this deal is delivering lifesaving results,” Mr. Biden said. “Critical aid is going in and hostages are coming out. This deal is structured so that it can be extended to keep building on these results. That’s my goal, that’s our goal, to keep this pause going beyond tomorrow so that we can continue to see more hostages come out and surge more humanitarian relief to those in need in Gaza.”

Earlier in the day Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, sidestepped questions about whether the president would impose conditions to future aid to Israel, including a freeze on Israeli settlements in the West Bank. But he said Mr. Biden was working toward a peace plan that includes a two-state solution.

“We believe that this is absolutely a moment for us to be working with everyone in the region,” Mr. Sullivan said. “We do think this is a moment for that kind of diplomacy.”

Mr. Biden stressed that freeing Americans held hostage has been the administration’s focus since the Oct. 7 attacks. The White House described the release of Judith and Natalie Raanan of Chicago in October as a “pilot” for the releases this past week.

A senior administration official said that unlike other potential Americans held hostage in Gaza whose whereabouts and conditions have not been confirmed, U.S. officials had a general understanding that Avigail was being held in the northern part of Gaza with neighbors from the family’s kibbutz.

Throughout the hostage discussions in Qatar and Egypt, U.S. officials insisted that Avigail be included on “an early list” as well as the other two Americans in the category of women and children, according to the official, who asked for anonymity to discuss national security.

On Sunday morning, U.S. officials tracked Avigail’s movement from Gaza as she was transferred to the International Committee of the Red Cross and ultimately into Israel.

Mr. Biden called the diplomatic efforts a “day-by-day approach” but said “the proof that this is working, and worth pursuing further, is in every smile and grateful tear we see on the faces of those families that are finally getting back together again. The proof is little Abigail.”"
185,185,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/26/world/middleeast/protesters-manhattan-bridge-ceasefire-gaza.html,"Hundreds of protesters from an anti-Zionist Jewish group shut down the Manhattan Bridge on Sunday, snarling city traffic for hours.

The demonstration, organized by the activist group Jewish Voice for Peace, which favors a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, began around 2 p.m., with a large Police Department contingent on the scene.

Drivers sat bumper to bumper for at least an hour as the protesters blocked off the Manhattan entrance to the bridge, which connects Canal Street in Lower Manhattan to Downtown Brooklyn. The police diverted vehicles from the area as protesters hung a pro-Palestinian banner from the bridge over the East River.

By 3 p.m., the demonstrators were sitting in the middle of the entrance ramp under the grand arch and colonnade near Canal Street and the Bowery. Some waved Palestinian flags as they pumped their fists and chanted, “Let Gaza live.” One person scaled the arch’s stone facade and hung a Palestinian flag.

“We needed to continue to raise our voices and continue to speak out because there’s thousands of Palestinians that are under the rubble right now,” Jay Saper, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace, said during the demonstration.

The protest was peaceful, and the bridge reopened around 5:30 p.m. The police did not immediately say if anyone was arrested."

On Friday, nearly seven weeks later, she spent her fourth birthday while under captivity. And on Sunday, she was finally freed, as one of the hostages Hamas released under a deal with Israel.

Her name is Avigail Idan. Avigail, whose name has also been spelled “Abigail” in U.S. media reports, is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States, and was among the roughly 240 people, including around 10 American citizens, taken as hostages by Hamas on Oct. 7.

After Avigail’s release, several members of her family reacted with relief. “We are blessed to give her lots of love and care and to help her build her life again,” Tal Idan, her aunt, wrote in a text message. “Feels like a miracle that came true,” she added.

Liz Hirsh Naftali and Noa Naftali, her great-aunt and cousin, said in a statement that they had “hoped and prayed today would come,” thanking President Biden and the Qatari government, which helped broker the cease-fire deal.

Avigail’s case has received wide attention, particularly in the United States, where several of her relatives are based in California. President Biden expressed relief over the news of her release on Sunday.

“Thank God she’s home,” Mr. Biden told reporters in Nantucket, Mass., on Sunday. “I wish I was there to hold her.”"
188,188,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/26/world/middleeast/thailand-gaza-israel-hamas-hostage.html,"Watsana Yojampa had been waiting by the telephone for nearly two months, wondering whether she would get good news — or the worst possible message that a mother could hear.

Soon after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in southern Israel in which about 240 hostages were taken to Gaza, Ms. Watsana’s son, Anucha Angkaew, appeared in a photograph that circulated on social media showing him with three other men being held at gunpoint, hands behind their backs.

On Sunday at 4 a.m., Ms. Watsana got the phone call that she was waiting for. Her niece learned on X, the social media site, that Mr. Anucha, an avocado farmhand in Israel, had been released, and she called her aunt. Four hours later, Thai embassy officials confirmed the news to Ms. Watsana.

“I’m so glad, so delighted, that no words can explain,” Ms. Watsana said by telephone. “They told me that my son is now under the care of a medical team in a hospital for a health checkup. I hope he is fine and safe.”

Mr. Anucha was among four Thai hostages released on Sunday by Hamas as part of a swap with Israel. Thailand’s prime minister, Srettha Thavisin, said on Sunday that the other three were Natthaphon Onkaew, Khomkrit Chombua and Manee Jirachat. (Their names were written in Thai, and The New York Times transliterated them.)

Mr. Srettha said on X that all four men were healthy and not in need of urgent medical attention, and that their mental health appeared to be good. They asked to take showers and contact their relatives, according to Mr. Srettha.

Separately, the Thai Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that Israeli authorities had increased by two the number of Thai citizens they believe had been abducted. That means 18 Thai citizens are still being held hostage."
189,189,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/us/vermont-shooting-burlington-palestinian-american.html,"The lessons of their upbringing in the West Bank, where they met as young boys, had traveled with them to their new lives in the United States. Educated at a Quaker school in Ramallah, its culture steeped in values including social justice and nonviolence, two of the young men had spoken out on their U.S. campuses about the suffering of Palestinians after a terrorist attack by Hamas last month led Israel to besiege Gaza.

From his hospital bed in Vermont, as he wrestled with the prospect of permanent disability, Mr. Awartani sent a message that was read at a vigil on the Brown campus in Providence on Monday night. In it, he asked his peers to remember that the attack on him did not happen “in a vacuum” but was part of “a larger story.”

“I understand that the pain is so much more real and immediate because many of you know me,” Mr. Awartani wrote, “but any attack like this is horrific, be it here or in Palestine. This is why when you send your wishes and light your candles for me today, your mind should not just be focused on me as an individual, rather as a proud member of a people being oppressed.”

Friends said Mr. Awartani had joined other students in calling for Brown’s leaders to speak out on behalf of Palestinians, just as they had publicly condemned the Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas.

Aboud Ashhab, a Brown classmate and longtime friend of Mr. Awartani, said in an interview that the two, along with several other students, had met with administrators to express their concerns about Arab students’ safety but found the response disappointing."

The Israel Defense Forces invaded the camp and our home. They stayed for three days. After that, I was afraid of Israelis. I always thought that they were coming to kill or kidnap me.

And yet I know the world can be better. I’ve seen how people in other conflicts have worked toward coexistence, and I know that one day I will work to better Gaza, to rebuild our community and to move forward. But this week I took the only opportunity that secured my immediate future: to flee.

I’m a Palestinian raised in the Gaza Strip, so I have long known conflict. My family are refugees from 1948; my grandmother used to tell me really great stories about our village, Al Muharraqa. It was on the eastern border of Gaza, about nine miles from Gaza City.

Still, every other time there has been a war in Gaza, it hasn’t really come to this level of intensity. This is the first time in my life I really didn’t know where to go or if I would survive at all. But because I have seen a different version of this world, I still held out hope."
191,191,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/25/world/middleeast/american-hostages-hamas-israel.html,"American hostages are not likely to be among the second group of women and children freed by Hamas, an American official said on Saturday.

The senior Biden administration official, who asked not to be named to discuss national security issues, said in a statement that the cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas that called for the release of Palestinian prisoners and people abducted by Hamas last month was “early in the process.”

“We are hopeful that will include three dual national women and children, who are American citizens,” the official wrote. “This will unfold over the coming days.”

The cease-fire deal calls for Israel to release 150 Palestinian women and minors, many of whom have been convicted of violent crimes. In exchange, Hamas is expected to release at least 50 women and children who were kidnapped in the Oct. 7 assault in which Hamas killed about 1,200 people in their homes and at a music festival, according to Israeli officials.

President Biden said at a news conference on Friday that he believed the four-day cease-fire deal between Hamas and Israel would result in the return of American hostages.

But no Americans were among the 24 people released by Hamas in the first exchange on Friday. That group included 13 Israelis, 10 Thai citizens and one Filipino.

The senior Biden administration official said the White House remained “hopeful” that American citizens would be among the hostages freed in the coming days."
192,192,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/business/energy-environment/opec-oil-prices.html,"These are tricky times for the world’s major oil producers: Prices are lower, the health of the global economy is uncertain, and, even as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries tries to cut output, supplies from other producers, notably the United States, are growing.

No wonder the group postponed its year-end meeting. Initially scheduled for last weekend in Vienna, the meeting is now planned for Thursday, barring another postponement. The agenda — whether to cut production further, and by how much — is likely to be unpalatable for many of the 23 members.

The price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, has fallen to about $82 a barrel, from a high of more than $96 this year and $128 at its height early in the Ukraine war.



It has dropped even as producers in OPEC Plus, a bigger group that includes Russia, have cut production, but the coming months seem unlikely to give oil producers a respite from this squeeze.

After three years of pandemic recovery and robust increases in demand for oil, appetite is expected to slow in 2024. The main reasons: China, which accounted for three-quarters of global demand growth in 2023, is facing an economic slowdown. Overall economic expansion is expected to be tepid while more efficient energy use and increasing numbers of electric vehicles reduce oil consumption. With production expected to increase outside of OPEC Plus, there will be little need for increased output from the producers group in the early part of 2024 or, perhaps, longer, analysts say."
193,193,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/26/world/europe/gaza-life-war.html,"In response to the devastating Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, the group that controls the Gaza Strip, Israel imposed what it called a complete siege — cutting off almost all water, food, electricity and fuel for the more than two million Palestinians living in Gaza. It also launched thousands of airstrikes on the enclave and sent in ground forces to try to root out Hamas.

A brief cease-fire, the first since the war began seven weeks ago, began to take hold on Friday, and as part of a hostage agreement between Israel and Hamas, dozens of trucks with water and other vital humanitarian aid crossed into Gaza.

Still, it was far less than what typically came into the territory before the war, and there was no indication that the freer flow of aid would last beyond the four-day agreed truce.

Before the cease-fire, little humanitarian aid — far short of what Gazans need — had been trickling in. And so, from the north to the south, in tented camps, apartments, schools and hospitals, residents crammed together in ever-shrinking spaces have been struggling every day to meet their most basic needs.

Surviving has become a full-time, perilous undertaking.

Days start well before dawn. Tasks seem simple: Fetch water. Bake bread. Buy diapers. Stay alive.

But people do not always succeed.

Mineral water trucked into the territory in aid convoys has been enough for only 4 percent of the population, according to the United Nations World Food Program. Some desalinated water is still being distributed in the south, but the north has no potable water sources left, according to the U.N. People who cannot access the scarce mineral and desalinated water rely on brackish water from wells, which the U.N. has said is not safe for human consumption.

Flour, too, is running out and most wheat mills have been bombed, according to the United Nations. Humanitarian agencies have managed to deliver bread, canned tuna and date bars to about a quarter of the population since Oct. 7, but distribution is hampered by fighting and the siege, the World Food Program said. Some farmers are slaughtering their animals, trading their future livelihoods for the emergency at hand.

The World Food Program has warned that only 10 percent of the food Gaza needs has entered the territory since the war began, creating “a massive food gap and widespread hunger.”

“Wheat flour, dairy products, cheese, eggs and mineral water have completely disappeared,” in the market, Alia Zaki, a spokeswoman for the World Food Program, said this month."
194,194,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/25/opinion/israel-gaza-peace-ceasefire.html,"It is said that wars end when both sides conclude they have nothing more to gain by fighting. By that logic, Israel and the Palestinians should have long ago agreed to the only solution that makes sense: separate states side by side. They’ve tried, again and again, but in this cauldron of religious passion and competing grievances, peace has always lost out. Is there any chance that things will be different when the guns fall silent this time?

On the face of it, it does not seem promising. The brutal attack by Hamas on Oct. 7 and the massive Israeli retaliatory assault on Gaza have already led to too much death and destruction and have ignited communal hatreds in the United States and beyond. Every eruption in the past — whether war, intifada or military raid — has only demonstrated that neither side can achieve its longed-for security, dignity or peace through violence. On the contrary, every eruption only hardens divisions and ensures more bloodshed next time.

In fact, what peace might look like is not a mystery: The shape of a Palestinian state has been explored in minute detail by successive peace conferences, meetings, negotiations and private initiatives, collectively known — or derided, in their apparent futility — as the peace process. The Oslo Accords of the 1990s were a major breakthrough in bringing hardened Palestinian and Israeli commanders to the table and establishing basic principles of coexistence. In 2000, Ehud Barak, Israel’s prime minister at the time, put a significant offer on the table to the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat for a two-state solution, which he rejected as insufficient and failed to meet with any serious counteroffer. Several years later, Mr. Barak’s successor Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian Authority leader, Mahmoud Abbas, met 36 times over nearly two years to hammer out a detailed plan that involved swapping some land, sharing Jerusalem, creating a free passage between the West Bank and Gaza and cooperating on business and resources.

That initiative foundered, as they all did, through violence, politics and circumstance: the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a clash with Hamas in Gaza, Mr. Olmert’s resignation and Benjamin Netanyahu’s victory, the ouster of the Palestinian Authority from Gaza. Extremists — be it Palestinian Islamists determined to destroy the Jewish state or Israeli settlers determined to push Palestinians out of the West Bank — knew they could undermine any effort toward peace through provocation or terrorism.

The victims, as they always are in this cruel war, are the children, women and men who just want to live in peace. The victors, as always, are the zealots who pursue their absolutist goals by murder, provocation and deception, demonizing the other side. It is likely that Hamas launched its attack on Oct. 7 in part to undermine the movement toward an Israeli deal for normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia.

This board has called many times for an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, and we have called for mercy and reason in the current conflict. We have based this on the presumption, the hope, that there are still enough people who see the futility and horror of the endless cycle of violence on both sides and that the United States, which has invested so much treasure and diplomatic effort into resolving the crisis and has given Israel unstinting support through the decades, still has some clout. We have to believe this, because the alternative is anarchy and blood.

How the current fighting ends will shape much of what happens next. There is no telling whether a truce and hostage-prisoner exchange mediated by Qatar and the Biden administration will hold or, if it does, for how long. But there is still every reason to think beyond the fighting, if only because the terrible cost it is exacting demands sanity. These are areas that bear deliberation:

The fact that no Arab states have openly endorsed the Hamas invasion and two — Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates — denounced it outright while expressing concerns for the impact on Gaza’s civilians is important. It shows that the last thing Arab leaders want is for Hamas, backed by Iran and long dedicated to the destruction of the Jewish state, to be strengthened by the current war with Israel.

That said, these states — mostly out of frustration with the Palestinian Authority’s corruption and unwillingness in past negotiations, with Mr. Barak and with Mr. Olmert, to agree on a painful, end-of-all-claims compromise with Israel — began to wash their hands of the Palestinian cause. These states needed and wanted their own direct ties to Israel, primarily to counterbalance Iran. So in the Abraham Accords and subsequent discussions about normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, the Palestinians were effectively left aside. If one outcome of this war is a still moderate Palestinian Authority with better leadership, the natural partnership between it and the Arab states can be renewed. This could, in turn, revive a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as widening normalization between Israel and Arab or Muslim states such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Indonesia.

It is also noteworthy that the Palestinian Authority under Mr. Abbas has largely stayed clear of the Gaza eruption. And the role of the Biden administration in mediating the truce, whatever it was, is, at the least, evidence that the United States, however divided, remains a go-between to be reckoned with. These factors suggest there is still a foundation for future negotiations.

But we have no illusions: Through its use of terrorism, Hamas has destroyed whatever legitimacy it had as a governing force. For these negotiations to be meaningful, the Palestinian Authority has to be overhauled. It needs new leadership and institutional reform. To generate and maintain any stable peace with Israel, the authority needs to be able to demonstrate that, in comparison with Hamas, it is more capable of governing Gaza and the West Bank effectively. In its present condition, it cannot.

At the same time, Israel and its supporters must accept that this is not an equal contest. Israel is the dominant power here, and in the current conflict, Israel will once again need to be first to move toward the establishment of a Palestinian state. For many Israelis, their primary concern is finding security, or bitachon, a Hebrew word that also encompasses trust and faith, and it requires a leap of both to believe that this will come from an independent Palestinian state. But the alternatives — continuing the occupation and incorporating occupied territories into Israel — are demonstrably worse.

To make that choice, Israel must jettison the government of Mr. Netanyahu, which has steadfastly worked against a settlement with the Palestinians.

Mr. Netanyahu cannot lead Israel in the search for peace. Now 74, he has been in and out of the prime minister’s office since his first election victory in 1996, in the wake of Mr. Rabin’s assassination by an Israeli extremist for signing the Oslo Accords. In 2009, Mr. Netanyahu gave a famous speech at Bar-Ilan University embracing the principle of a Palestinian state alongside Israel — on condition that the state was demilitarized and that the Palestinians recognized Israel as the state of the Jewish people. But everything he has done since has been to expand settlements in the West Bank and to stymie the peace process. His strategy was to undermine the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, even though he knew it was cooperating with Israel’s security services to help maintain calm there, while tacitly helping Hamas consolidate its power in Gaza. This allowed him to tell every American president: I’d love to make peace, but I have no Palestinian partner; they’re divided.

Many Israelis now blame Mr. Netanyahu’s far-right cabinet partners for fracturing the Israeli armed forces with a dangerous attempt to undermine the judiciary and diverting the army’s attention from the Gaza border by fomenting trouble in the West Bank. The Israeli media has reported that well before the Hamas invasion on Oct. 7, Israel’s military intelligence warned Mr. Netanyahu that Hamas and Hezbollah had noticed the fractures in Israeli society — and were tempted by them.

Holding Israel’s leaders to account in no way lessens the responsibility that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad bear for the present suffering in Gaza. Hamas knew full well that a murderous attack on Israeli civilians would ensure a massive retaliation against the helpless civilians of Gaza, including innumerable children — the very people Hamas purported to represent and govern. Hamas has gained advantage by deliberately slaughtering civilians in Israel and justifying the deaths of thousands of its own people as martyrdom. The current leaders of Hamas, who have never renounced the obliteration of Israel as a goal and have pledged to continue inflicting violence to that end, have effectively rejected any role in seeking a lasting settlement.

With Mr. Netanyahu still leading Israel’s government and Hamas still in control of Gaza, it is difficult right now to imagine credible negotiations toward peace. The “river to the sea” extremists, those who ecstatically call for the eradication of the other, cannot play a constructive part.

Yet peace is still possible, and it is also possible that those who might sit at the table will include former militants. Given the history of this conflict, that is actually quite likely. The primary condition for any peace negotiation is that those who seek peace must lay down their arms and come prepared to make painful concessions. Mr. Rabin was first a military leader, and his interlocutor, Mr. Arafat, was viewed by most Israelis at the time as a terrorist. Many prominent Israeli leaders today similarly come from military backgrounds, and some of the Palestinians who could lead their side are likely to have spent time or are spending time in Israeli prisons. The critical qualification is for each side to understand the yearnings and fears of the other and to accept that the other has a right to live in peace.

How that can work is clear. The urgent challenge, as soon as the guns fall silent, is for Israel, the Palestinians, the Arab states, the United States and all other parties with an interest in a settlement to get to work.

The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips. And here’s our email: letters@nytimes.com.

Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
195,195,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/business/israel-palestine-google-employees.html,"“You have to be very, very, very careful, because any sort of criticism toward the Israeli state can be easily taken as antisemitism,” he said in an interview. Mr. Gilani, a 38-year-old American born to Pakistani immigrants, explained that his caution was also informed by a lifetime of being misunderstood and profiled for being Muslim.

That was before Oct. 7.

In the month since Hamas launched an attack inside Israel, and Israel retaliated with a bombing campaign and invasion of the Gaza Strip, discussion of the topic at Google — for Muslims and Jews — has sunk into a morass of hostility and intolerance, Mr. Gilani and other employees say.

Israeli and Jewish employees have expressed anger over messages posted in Google’s internal channels, including at least one that was overtly antisemitic, and on Wednesday a group of workers published an open letter addressed to Google leadership accusing the company of a double standard that allows for “freedom of expression for Israeli Googlers versus Arab, Muslim and Palestinian Googlers.”

The letter was not signed by any individuals. Instead it was attributed to “Muslim, Palestinian and Arab Google employees joined by anti-Zionist Jewish colleagues.” The New York Times discussed the matter with seven Google employees and reviewed messages posted in employee channels for this article. A few of the employees, including Mr. Gilani, were willing to be identified, but others asked not to be named out of concern for professional ramifications.

Pro-Palestinian employees say the company has allowed supporters of Israel to speak freely about their opinions on the topic, while taking a heavy hand with Muslim employees who have criticized Israel’s retaliation in Gaza.

“I do not feel safe saying what I want to say,” Mr. Gilani said in an interview before the letter was published.

Google said the acrimony described to The Times by both Muslim and Jewish employees was limited to a small group of its many thousands of workers.

“This is a highly sensitive time and topic in every company and workplace, and we have many employees who are personally affected,” Courtenay Mencini, a company spokeswoman, wrote in an emailed response to questions. “The overwhelming majority of those employees are not engaged in internal discussions or debate, and many have said they’ve appreciated our fast response and our focus on the safety of our employees.”

Google isn’t alone in facing this turmoil. The topic has exposed rifts at other elite institutions in the United States — colleges, Hollywood and the Democratic Party, to name a few — as declarations of solidarity for Palestinians or calls for an Israeli cease-fire are met with condemnation as undermining Israel’s right to defend itself against terrorism.

Businesses are struggling with how to address the conflict and to draw clear boundaries around acceptable speech on the topic. More broadly, anger over the conflict has led to a rise in hate crimes and threats against both Jews and Muslims.

Among technology companies, Microsoft has taken down some posts by workers discussing the conflict, and at Meta, internal tensions also rose as the company removed internal employee messages supporting other Palestinians at Meta.



But at Google, the issue has a unique meaning.

Even compared with its Silicon Valley peers, Google has become a hub for employee activism, a legacy of the company’s open and informal founding culture.

In recent years, Google employees have protested former President Donald J. Trump’s ban on immigration from Muslim-majority countries, walked out to protest the company’s handling of sexual harassment, formed a union and petitioned leadership to stop working with the Pentagon.

The letter sent on Wednesday resurfaces another sore point: Google’s role in a $1.2 billion contract to supply Israel and its military with artificial intelligence and other computing power, technology that critics and activists say could be used to surveil Palestinians.

When the contract, called Project Nimbus, took effect in 2021, a number of employees objected publicly and said they were threatened for speaking out in support of Palestinians, claims that are similar to those in Wednesday’s letter. Last year, a Jewish employee of Google who led an effort to get the company to drop out of the contract resigned, claiming it had retaliated against her.

After the fighting broke out last month, employees started a new petition for Google to cancel Nimbus. By Tuesday, it had 675 signatures, according to one of the employees.

“Criticizing Project Nimbus has made people targets,” said Rachel Westrick, a software engineer at Google who said she supported the letter. Ms. Westrick said she also wanted the company to condemn the violence against Palestinians, as it did the attack by Hamas, and address racism that she says her colleagues have experienced.

The company has said Google’s role in Nimbus involves it providing services for run-of-the-mill government agency work and isn’t applied to highly sensitive or classified projects.

Israel’s supporters see calls to drop Nimbus, and other efforts to boycott the country, as hostile to the Jewish state. Jewish and Israeli workers also said the language that their colleagues were using was deeply offensive, in particular when Israel’s actions in Gaza were described as a “genocide.”

One Israeli employee said that, in her view, the company had allowed a lot of pro-Hamas statements to spread inside of Google’s internal communication platforms unchecked. Google is slower to internally acknowledge anything regarding Israel, in this worker’s view, compared with issues like Black Lives Matter and violence against Asian Americans.

Three people said one worker had been fired after writing in an internal company message board that Israelis living near Gaza “deserved to be impacted.”

The company released a statement condemning Hamas on Oct. 7, and a few days later it told Jewish employees that it was monitoring internal platforms for antisemitism and promised to take action — including firing offenders — if warranted.

The next week, in an email to staff, Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, acknowledged that Jewish employees were “experiencing a rise in antisemitic incidents,” and that Palestinian, Arab and Muslim employees were “deeply affected by a concerning rise in Islamophobia and are watching with dread as Palestinian civilians in Gaza have suffered significant loss and fear for their lives amid the escalating war and humanitarian crisis.”

But the employees behind Wednesday’s letter say this isn’t enough: “We demand that Sundar Pichai, Thomas Kurian and other Google leadership issue a public condemnation of the ongoing genocide in the strongest possible terms,” it reads. Mr. Kurian is chief executive of Google’s cloud computing business.

Supporters of Palestinians at Meta also feel they are facing unfair treatment. A handful of workers there reported that on Workplace, Meta’s internal communication platform, posts that included the phrase “pray for Palestine” or otherwise expressed support for Palestinians — with no mention of Hamas — were being flagged for removal internally, according to two employees who shared the messages with The Times.

Around the same time that Meta’s workers were having difficulties internally, the company said a “bug” in its code — a mistranslation of Arabic — had led to the word “terrorist” being inserted in some users’ Instagram biographies if they included the word “Palestine” or a Palestinian flag emoji. The Washington Post and 404 Media earlier reported on some of the problems at Meta.

A Meta spokesman declined to comment.

Mr. Gilani said he couldn’t figure out what, if anything, he could say at work about what he saw as the killing of innocent civilians.

He knows the risks of speaking out on such a divisive topic, thanks in part to an experience he had in 2014. After he was repeatedly stopped by airport security, he filed a Freedom of Information Act request to try and find out if he was on a watch list. But instead of getting the information, he was approached and questioned by the F.B.I. at Google’s offices.

But now, he said, he’s worried that retaliation against Muslim employees is having a chilling effect on speech at Google, and he has developed a playbook for how to speak on the subject at work: Condemn Hamas and move on.

“It feels like I have to condemn Hamas 10 times before saying one tiny, tiny thing criticizing Israel.”

196,196,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/26/arts/music/emigre-oratorio-shanghai-jews-.html,"“Émigré,” a new oratorio about Jewish refugees who fled Nazi Germany for Shanghai in the late 1930s, begins with a song by two brothers, Josef and Otto, as their steamship approaches a Chinese harbor.

“Shanghai, beacon of light on a silent shore,” they sing. “Shanghai, answer these desperate cries.”

The emigration of thousands of Central European and Eastern European Jews to China in the late 1930s and early 1940s — and their survival of the Holocaust — is one of World War II’s most dramatic but little-known chapters.

In “Émigré,” a 90-minute oratorio that premiered this month in Shanghai and will come to the New York Philharmonic in February 2024, the stories of these refugees and their attempts to build new lives in war-torn China are front and center."
197,197,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/26/magazine/phil-klay-interview.html,"Talk Finding a Moral Center in This Era of War

Phil Klay, as both a participant and a writer, has been thinking deeply about war for a long time. In his two acclaimed works of fiction, the book of short stories “Redeployment,” which won a 2014 National Book Award, and the novel “Missionaries” (2020), and in the nonfiction collection “Uncertain Ground: Citizenship in an Age of Endless, Invisible War” (2022), Klay has interrogated, to profound effect and with a deeply humane and moral sensibility, what war does to our hearts and minds, individually and collectively, here and abroad. “I’m interested in the kinds of stories that we tell ourselves about war,” says Klay, who is a 40-year-old veteran of the Iraq war. “I’m interested in the uncomfortable ones, but also in the ones that feel too comfortable and need to be told alongside other types of stories that make it more troubling.”

This is maybe overly cynical, but why do you think that having a less ideologically rigid point of view is more effective in the long term than the opposite? In the long term, if you blinker yourself to reality, it limits your ability to formulate positions that are based in reality and therefore formulate positions that will achieve something lasting and moral. You need to be open to complexity because whatever narrow thing that you want to achieve in the real world will, if it gets put into practice, be put into practice in the real world. Not in the ideologically antiseptic world that you’ve created in your head.

What might crack open in someone that they’re able to see the suffering of civilian others as just as grave a human concern as the suffering of civilians on the side they support ideologically? In war, there’s a primary experience: a terrified father in Gaza as bombs are falling, unsure of whether he can protect his family; or the Israeli soldier trying to deal with Hamas’s tunnel network. There is a responsibility when you’re thinking these things through to sit with some of those primary experiences to the extent that you can, and think about them without immediately seeking to churn them into something politically useful. Because they mean more than whatever policy cash-out we get from them.

Phil Klay (center, with camera) in Iraq in 2007. From Phil Klay

We’ve entered this awful period, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and then the conflict between Israel and Hamas, when war is present in many people’s minds in a way that, perhaps, it hasn’t been before. But has this moment changed anything fundamental in how we think about war? I think that Ukraine represents not a good war — because the closer you get to war, the more obvious it is that a phrase like “a good war” has no valid meaning — but rather a necessary war. The clear moral case for Ukraine is about as straightforward a case of a just defense against a vicious aggressor as you could find. There is a certain appeal for that, especially for Americans accustomed to interminable, murky operations where military activities were ranging from trying to strengthen host nations to counterterrorism as well as more straightforward combat. Here is a war with a clear front line with a clear moral imperative. That, I think, has shifted people’s perceptions.

You’ve written about the need for soldiers to be able to connect their missions to the broader values of their society. How might that apply to American soldiers today, given that there seems to be less and less consensus about our shared values? The debate over what America means is nothing new. To me, the crucial aspect of American identity is a certain embrace of change. I think of American identity as being like Heraclitus’ river that you can never step in twice. It doesn’t mean that there are no riverbanks. It’s not an amorphous pool of water spilling out in all directions. Nevertheless, a certain degree of turbulence is important for growth and allows for necessary changes to come about.

You mean as far as belief? I don’t know what other option there is than on a personal level to get on one’s knees and beg for forgiveness. We’re so unequal to responding to the challenges of the world that we nevertheless have a responsibility to. I mean, we’ve been talking about the current conflict, and don’t you just feel stupefied by the horror of it?

It’s completely shattering. It is.

198,198,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/26/us/palestinian-students-shootings-burlington.html,"The police in Burlington, Vt., have arrested a suspect in the shooting of three students of Palestinian descent that the city’s mayor said was being investigated as a possible hate crime.

The suspect, identified by the police as Jason J. Eaton, 48, was expected to be arraigned Monday in connection with the shooting of the students, three men in their 20s who attend American universities. They were shot and wounded on Saturday by a white man with a handgun while they were walking near the University of Vermont, the police said. Two of the victims were wearing Palestinian kaffiyehs, a traditional headdress.

The young men told family members they were speaking a hybrid of English and Arabic before the man shot at them four times without saying anything before the attack, according to a family spokeswoman.

Two of the victims were in stable condition, the authorities said. The third sustained much more serious injuries."
199,199,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/nyregion/macys-parade-protesters-arrested.html,"The New York Police Department detained 34 demonstrators at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade who were protesting Israel’s killings of civilians in Gaza, the authorities said on Friday.

The parade, which drew protesters waving Palestinian flags and chanting, was briefly stalled when some of the demonstrators, dressed in white jumpsuits splashed in fake blood, sought to glue their hands to the pavement. The action was just one of a series of demonstrations over the Thanksgiving holiday in which protesters across the country demanded a permanent cease-fire.

Four of the protesters face a range of charges, including harassment, obstruction of governmental administration and resisting arrest. Thirty received summonses for trespassing and disorderly conduct along the parade route.

Activists painted the words “Free Palestine” on the outside of the New York Public Library’s main branch and accompanied the message with handprints in red paint. The police said the investigation into the vandalism, which they defined as criminal mischief, was ongoing.

The protests came amid mounting global scrutiny of Israel’s bombings, which have been carried out in retaliation for the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that killed 1,200 people in Israel. More than 10 times as many people have been killed since then in Gaza, according to the region’s health ministry.

Earlier this week, Israel and Hamas agreed to a temporary cease-fire, and dozens of hostages were released from Gaza on Friday in exchange for the release of dozens more Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.

But the lull did little to cool tempers on Thursday in New York, where the interruption of the parade drew jeers from people gathered to see the event’s signature floats and balloons.

Protesters turned out again a day later in several cities for a series of actions aimed at disrupting the shopping holiday of Black Friday.

In New York, large crowds of demonstrators marched from Washington Square Park to Herald Square. The protest was largely peaceful, and a Police Department spokesman said there were no arrests."
200,200,https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000009196044/biden-gaza-cease-fire.html,"This morning, I’ve been engaged with my team as we began the first difficult days of implementing this deal. It’s only a start, but so far it’s gone well. We expect more hostages to be released tomorrow, and more the day after and more the day after that. Over the next few days, we expect that dozens of hostages will be returned to their families. We also remember all those who are still being held and renew our commitment to work for their release as well. Two American women and one four-year-old child, Avigail, who remains among those missing. We also will not stop until we get these hostages brought home and an answer to their whereabouts. I think the chances are real."
202,202,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/us/politics/biden-israel-hostages-release.html,"President Biden called the release of 24 hostages by Hamas on Friday “only a start, but so far it’s gone well.”

Speaking after Hamas freed hostages in Gaza and Israel released 39 Palestinian prisoners and detainees — the first exchange under their four-day truce — Mr. Biden predicted that more hostages would be released.

No Americans were among the first group of hostages freed, but Mr. Biden said his “hope and expectation” was that they would be released soon.

Mr. Biden, speaking from Nantucket, Mass., where he spent Thanksgiving with his family, said “the chances are real” that the pause could open the door to a longer cease-fire. He remains in contact with the leaders of Qatar, Egypt and Israel “to make sure this stays on track and every aspect of the deal is implemented.” Israel had already agreed to extend the truce if Hamas released at least 10 additional hostages per day.

Asked if he trusts Hamas to uphold its end of the deal, Mr. Biden said, “I don’t trust Hamas to do anything right. I only trust Hamas to respond to pressure.”

Marc Polymeropoulos, a former C.I.A. operations officer who has spent extensive time in the Middle East, said he believed Mr. Biden would face tremendous pressure from Democrats, Arab leaders and others in the international community to press for a permanent cease-fire.

“I think he’ll give Israel some runway, but pressure on him is growing,” Mr. Polymeropoulos said. The looming question after the four-day pause, he said, is “What happens on Day 5?”

The Israeli army has a mission to destroy Hamas, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said is not yet over. By some estimates, just over 2,000 Hamas fighters have been killed out of 40,000.

“So, the fight is far from over if the objective remains the elimination of Hamas,” said Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East.

Those freed on Friday included 13 Israeli women and children, 10 Thai citizens and one Filipino, according to Qatari officials. They were among more than 200 hostages that Hamas has held captive since its forces entered Israel on Oct. 7 to massacre and kidnap civilians. The cease-fire deal, negotiated over weeks by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, included the release of 150 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

Mr. Biden said that U.S. officials did not know the names or conditions of Americans or other hostages slated for release.

On Friday evening Mr. Biden attended a Christmas tree-lighting ceremony in downtown Nantucket. A handful of protesters holding “Free Palestine” shouted repeatedly, “Biden, Biden, you can’t hide. We charge you with genocide,” until a man went to a microphone asking them to stop and to remind them, “this is a community tree lighting.”

More than 140 trucks carrying fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid had entered Gaza from Egypt on Friday, according to the U.N. humanitarian office. “Hundreds more trucks are getting in position as well, ready to enter Gaza over the coming days to support Palestinians who are suffering greatly because of this war that Hamas has unleashed,” Mr. Biden said.

The Israeli military now occupies much of the northern half of the Gaza Strip, and some 1.7 million of Gaza’s 2.3 million Palestinian residents have been forced to flee their homes.

Mr. Biden put the blame for that squarely on Hamas. “Hamas doesn’t give a damn about them,” he said.

203,203,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/world/middleeast/nir-oz-israel-hostages.html,"All but one of the 13 Israeli hostages released on Friday were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, an Israeli village close to the Gaza border where Hamas militants took more than 70 people on Oct. 7.

Family members said they were thankful that 12 hostages taken from the kibbutz had been returned home to Israel, but that was only “a drop in the bucket,” said Larry Butler, 73, a Nir Oz resident who survived the attack. Of the estimated 215 hostages who remain in Gaza, roughly 30 percent of them are from Nir Oz.

Per capita, Nir Oz is the Israeli village most affected by the Oct. 7 assault.

That day, roughly 100 Nir Oz residents were killed or abducted — one quarter of the village’s prewar population.

On Friday night, the survivors felt some sense of salvation as 12 of their neighbors and relatives — ranging from Yaffa Adar, 85, to Aviv Asher, 2 — were driven to safety by the Red Cross through Egypt to Israel.

“Is that my grandmother?” a young girl cried out after residents identified Margalit Moses, 78, their neighbor from Nir Oz, waving from a Red Cross vehicle.

But that elation was tempered by a wider feeling of loss.

“There are kids here without parents, parents without kids, and grandparents with grandchildren but no parents,” Mr. Butler said."
204,204,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/world/middleeast/israel-west-bank-prisoners-release.html,"It was the moment the crowd outside the gates of Ofer prison just outside the West Bank city of Ramallah had awaited for hours: A large white bus carrying Palestinian prisoners and detainees exited the prison gates and made its way through the crowd around 8 p.m. Friday.

Throngs of Palestinians erupted in cheers while drivers revved their engines in celebration. Fireworks erupted, replacing the sounds of tear-gas canisters that Israeli security forces had fired to disperse the crowd throughout the afternoon. One man climbed on top of the bus and hoisted two Hamas flags, while those around him praised the group they saw as responsible for the release of their loved ones and neighbors.

“The people want Hamas! The people want Hamas!” They cried.

For hours on Friday afternoon into the early evening, hundreds of Palestinians had waited outside Ofer for the first group of Palestinian prisoners and detainees to be released as part of an exchange laid out in a deal between Israel and Hamas for a temporary cease-fire in Gaza.

The hours of anticipation had been tinged both with grief for the devastation wrought by the war in Gaza, and with elation for a moment that many saw as a small victory for Palestinians — one that many in the crowd attributed to Hamas.

As the prisoners and detainees made their way to a nearby municipality building, hundreds of people raced alongside them, waving Palestinian and Hamas flags.

Hanan Saleh al-Bargouthi, 59, who was among those released, hugged her husband and grandchildren as tears clouded her eyes. She had spent around 80 days in prison, she said. According to the Israeli authorities, her case was being tried in military court on state security charges. But now, reunited with her family, a sense of relief and defiance washed over her."
205,205,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/05/us/politics/william-burns-israel-middle-east-trip.html,"William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, arrived in Israel on Sunday for discussions with leaders and intelligence officials, the first stop in a multicountry trip in the region, according to U.S. officials.

The visit comes as the United States is trying to prod Israel to pursue a more targeted approach to attacking Hamas, allow pauses in the fighting for aid to enter Gaza and do more to avoid civilian casualties.

The United States is also looking to expand its intelligence sharing with Israel, providing information that could be useful about hostage locations or any follow-on attacks by Hamas. A U.S. official briefed on Mr. Burns’s trip said he planned to reinforce the American commitment to intelligence cooperation with partners in the region.

Mr. Burns will travel to several Middle Eastern countries for discussions about the situation in Gaza, ongoing hostage negotiations and the importance of deterring the war with Hamas from widening to a broader context, the U.S. official said.

U.S. officials have been visiting Israel at a regular cadence since war broke out after Hamas fighters attacked Israeli towns on Oct. 7 and killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians. Israel has retaliated with a punishing air campaign and ground invasion into Gaza, where Hamas is in control. More than 9,000 Palestinians have been killed in airstrikes since Israel began retaliating, according to Gaza’s health ministry. U.S. officials said their estimates of the number of Palestinians killed were similar.

Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken arrived on Friday to make the case to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and key national security officials that there are more effective ways to cripple Hamas than the intense air campaign.

A spokeswoman for the C.I.A. said the agency does not comment on the director’s travel.

Mr. Burns, who has extensive experience in the region, visited as key intelligence leaders in Israel have been heavily criticized for failing to detect the attack and the threat from Hamas more broadly.

As one of the Biden administration’s most trusted voices on Middle East issues, Mr. Burns has become something of a roving troubleshooting diplomat for the White House.

The visits by American officials, particularly President Biden, have made an impact on Israelis, many of whom have been frustrated with Mr. Netanyahu’s handling of the crisis. Still, there are tensions between Israeli officials and their American counterparts, as the United States pushes Israel to embrace a military campaign that takes more care to minimize civilian casualties.

American officials say they are not telling Israelis what to do, but they are advising them about their own experiences with the Iraq war and drilling into Mr. Netanyahu’s government the importance of not imitating America’s missteps after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Mr. Burns’s visit to Arab countries may be as important as his meetings in Israel.

His exact itinerary is unclear, but he is expected to visit Jordan. King Abdullah II canceled a meeting with Mr. Biden after a blast at a Gaza hospital led to high casualties. While the United States and Israel have blamed Hamas for the explosion, Hamas has said Israel is responsible. Much of Jordan’s population is ethnically Palestinian, putting the country, a close U.S. ally that has a peace treaty with Israel, in an especially tricky position as it navigates the fallout from the war.

Mr. Burns has a particularly close relationship with King Abdullah. He was the ambassador to Jordan when King Hussein died and Abdullah ascended to the throne. King Abdullah recently wrote a letter praising Mr. Burns’s diplomatic skills for a ceremony honoring the C.I.A. director."

His father was a member of Fatah, the political faction that controls the Palestinian Authority. But he has had enough of its rule in the West Bank.

On a recent day, Mr. Imtoor, 32, a small-business owner, stood outside his shop, watching a march for the many Palestinians detained in Israeli jails, whom Hamas says it is trying to free as part of a deal for a cease-fire in Gaza.

“I’m not Hamas, but I hope it comes here,” he said. “The P.A. has taken a lot from us, and it’s time for them to go.”

Referring to the monument in the center of Ramallah, he said: “The P.A. is working fine to protect the four lions on Manara Square, but they cannot protect the people from Israel.”"

The Israeli military’s aura of power was shaken by the Oct. 7 attack, the officials say.

The unfolding humanitarian crisis in Hamas-controlled Gaza, where the health ministry says more than 9,400 people have been killed, has provoked outrage in the region, in the United States and around the world, leading the Biden administration to be more vocal in saying that Israel has to do more to protect civilians.

Mr. Blinken urged Israel to agree to a series of pauses in the fighting to facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza and the exit of foreign nationals from the enclave, but Mr. Netanyahu rebuffed the idea, saying any pauses would be contingent on the release of all Israeli hostages.

In the first two weeks of the war, roughly 90 percent of the munitions Israel dropped in Gaza were satellite-guided bombs of 1,000 to 2,000 pounds, according to a senior U.S. military official. The rest were 250-pound small-diameter bombs.

Asked about the U.S. request to use smaller bombs, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces, Maj. Nir Dinar, said: “We don’t comment on munitions and our conversations with allies.”

Israel used at least two 2,000-pound bombs during an airstrike on Tuesday on Jabaliya, a dense area just north of Gaza City, according to experts and an analysis conducted by The New York Times of satellite images, photos and videos.

American military officials say that the smaller bombs are much better suited to the dense urban environments of Gaza. But Israel has over the years built up stocks of larger bombs, intended mostly to target hardened Hezbollah military positions in Lebanon.

The United States is now trying to send more of the smaller bombs to Israel, said the senior military official. If the United States can get those smaller munitions to Israel, American officials hope Israel will use them to mitigate the risk to civilians.

The United States has also increased the amount of intelligence that it is collecting in Gaza: American drones are flying over the enclave, searching for hostages held by Hamas and other groups, and U.S. military satellites have been redirected to monitor the enclave. The United States is also using aircraft on the two carriers in the Mediterranean to help collect additional intelligence, including electronic intercepts.

While the United States has increased the amount of intelligence that it is sharing with Israel, U.S. officials stressed they are not helping Israel pick targets for strikes.

American officials believe the less judicious Israel is, and the greater the Palestinian death toll, the more quickly pressure will build on its leaders to end the military operation. A more targeted campaign, U.S. officials tell them, could go on for longer and do more sustained damage to Hamas’s military wing.

“We do our best to destroy Hamas only, without harming the civilians,” said Iddo Ben-Anat, a deputy brigade commander leading part of the Israeli invasion of Gaza.

Arab leaders met with Mr. Blinken in Amman, Jordan, on Saturday, and demanded an immediate cease-fire, increasing pressure on the Biden administration to do more to rein in the Israeli campaign.

But Mr. Blinken publicly rebuffed the idea, saying, “It’s our view that a cease-fire now would simply leave Hamas in place, and able to regroup and repeat what it did on October 7.”

Democratic lawmakers and terrorism experts have said the higher the civilian casualty toll, the greater the resentment that will build in Gaza, resentment that Hamas can use to build further support.

Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts and an Iraq war veteran, said the America’s biggest mistake in that conflict was trying to provide “military solutions to fundamentally political problems.”

“Israel is not going to win their war against Hamas, which they have every right to fight, by military means alone,” Mr. Moulton said. “And often the wrong military means, like bombs that kill too many civilians, make the political endgame harder to reach.”

At the news conference in Tel Aviv, Mr. Blinken appeared to obliquely acknowledge that risk, arguing that while Hamas needed to be defeated “physically,” the international community needed to ensure that Hamas does not gain more followers in the process.

Mr. Blinken said that Hamas must be fought not just with military might, but also with “a better future, with a better vision” for the Palestinian people.

“Because in the absence of that, even after Hamas, those who sing the siren song of nihilism will find open ears,” Mr. Blinken said."
208,208,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/world/middleeast/un-unrwa-death-toll.html,"The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said on Monday that 89 employees of the U.N. agency aiding Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, had been killed in Gaza in the month of war between Israel and Hamas.

That is more “than in any comparable period in the history of our organization,” he told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York, adding that many of the employees had been killed with members of their family. The United Nations employs large numbers of Palestinians in Gaza, where almost half the working-age population is unemployed.

On Sunday, the leaders of United Nations agencies and other humanitarian groups issued a joint statement calling for an immediate cease-fire, saying, “Enough is enough. This must stop now.”

In the statement, they expressed “shock and horror” at the loss of life and called for the immediate release of hostages taken during the Hamas attacks in Israel last month. They noted that “more than 100 attacks against health care” had been reported and that “scores of aid workers” had been killed since the attacks and Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza.

Of the loss of U.N. staff members, Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, said: “The number goes up every day.”

“They are killed in the north, the middle and the south, men and women, some at home, some at displacement shelters, some bringing refugees to the shelters,” she added.

One staff member was killed as he waited in line for bread, she said, and another was killed at home with his wife and eight children. Most worked in the agency’s schools in Gaza, she said.

The World Health Organization said 16 health care workers had died while on duty in Gaza, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said its member organizations had lost seven staff members in the war.

The fatalities, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said, included three medical staff of Magen David Adom, Israel’s emergency medical service, who were killed as they tried to rescue people from the kibbutzim under attack by Hamas and take them to the hospital.

It also said it lost four paramedics working for the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Gaza as they treated casualties from the bombardment and tried to bring the wounded to the hospital.

“What happened in a couple of days is for us deeply worrying and shocking,” said Tommaso Della Longa, a spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. “It’s a reminder there is no respect for humanitarian teams in general.”

The humanitarian leaders, in their statement, condemned the deaths of some 1,400 Israelis and the continuing trauma for civilians exposed to rocket attacks. They also said the number of civilians killed in Gaza and the cutoff of essential supplies of food, water, medicine and fuel was “an outrage.”

The signatories included Martin Griffiths, the U.N.’s chief official for humanitarian and relief affairs, and Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization."
209,209,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/nyregion/nyu-langone-cancer-doctor-fired-lawsuit.html,"A prominent doctor is suing NYU Langone Health after he was fired as director of its cancer center over his social media postings about the Israel-Hamas war.

The lawsuit could propel NYU Langone — a major New York hospital — into the center of a national debate over how much power private institutions have to fire employees over their online postings.

Laws protecting employees from being fired for what they say or do outside of the office vary widely by state. In New York, the law is somewhat unclear, lawyers say. But as tensions and protests escalate over the violence in the Middle East, the issue of what sort of speech is protected or acceptable has roiled American businesses and campuses.

The wrongful termination lawsuit was brought by Dr. Benjamin Neel, a cancer biologist whose laboratory at NYU Langone conducts research on breast cancer, ovarian cancer and treatments for leukemia. Before he was fired, Dr. Neel had reposted a variety of anti-Hamas political cartoons, including two with offensive caricatures of Arab people, and messages on the social media platform X, like one that appeared to question the extent of the death toll in Gaza from Israel’s relentless bombing campaign.

He is far from the first person to lose his job over his public reactions to Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, or Israel’s subsequent airstrikes and invasion of Gaza. Journalists have lost jobs, and law students have had job offers rescinded. Palestine Legal, an advocacy group, says it has received over 80 requests since Oct. 7 for help over people’s firings.

Multiple doctors have also lost their jobs or been suspended for statements about the war. At Johns Hopkins Hospital, a pediatric cardiologist was placed on leave after being accused of calling Palestinians “bloodthirsty morally depraved animals” in online postings, according to a news report. He later wrote his colleagues an apology for what he said were “regrettable, hurtful messages,” according to a local news report.

An emergency room doctor at Lenox Hill Hospital, on the Upper East Side, was fired after being accused of posting “Zionist settlers getting a taste of their own medicine” following the Oct. 7 attacks. The doctor declined to comment.

Dr. Neel is one of two doctors whom NYU Langone has removed for online postings since the war began last month. The first, Dr. Zaki Masoud, a trainee at NYU Langone’s hospital in Mineola, Long Island, was “removed from service,” according to the hospital, after he was accused of posting a message on Instagram in defense of the Hamas attack.

An online petition calling on the hospital to reverse course and reinstate Dr. Masoud has garnered 89,000 signatures. He could not be reached for comment.

Dr. Neel’s lawsuit, filed last week in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, claims that NYU Langone feared a backlash after firing Dr. Masoud and so decided to fire Dr. Neel as well — in an “ill-considered plan to feign the appearance of even-handedness.”

Dr. Neel claims that an executive vice president at the hospital told Dr. Neel that his online posts were “making it hard” to justify firing others, like Dr. Masoud. “Dr. Neel was offered up as a sacrificial lamb,” the suit claims.

Most of the social media posts at issue were reposts of political cartoons, according to the lawsuit. One of the cartoons takes aim at western defenders of Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel. The cartoon shows a protest in which demonstrators are holding aloft signs justifying torture and rape. Another cartoon questions whether negotiating a two-state solution is viable with Hamas in power. Dr. Neel also shared a post questioning the accuracy of a list of approximately 7,000 people that the Hamas-run Health ministry in Gaza said had been killed during Israel’s bombing campaign.

Dr. Neel continues to be a tenured professor at NYU Langone Health and to oversee a laboratory, but he was terminated from his job as director of the hospital’s Perlmutter Cancer Center — resulting in his hospital pay being slashed by about two-thirds, his lawyer, Milton Williams, said.

Dr. Neel’s research has focused on the communication between healthy cells and “how this is disrupted in cancer,” his lawyer said. As director of the cancer center, he oversaw more than 1,000 employees, according to his lawyer.

The lawsuit claims that Dr. Neel was told his social media posts were deemed to be an “intentional breach” of NYU Langone’s Code of Conduct and Social Media Policy and that he failed to meet “the standards expected of a physician in a leadership role” and had hurt the hospital’s reputation.

“Several times since last month, we reminded all employees of our high standards, as well as our Code of Conduct and Social Media Policy,” NYU Langone said in a statement responding to the lawsuit. “Nonetheless, Dr. Ben Neel, as a leader at our institution, disregarded these standards in a series of public social media posts and later locked his Twitter/X account. NYU Langone stands by our decision and looks forward to defending it in court.”

Dr. Neel’s lawsuit claims that support for Israel is a component of his Jewish identity. NYU Langone’s decision to punish him for his online posts amounts to religious discrimination, the lawsuit claims.

In addition to accusing NYU Langone of discrimination, the lawsuit also claims that New York law protects workers from being fired for social media outside of work hours — a debatable proposition.

A few states, such as Connecticut, have restricted the ability of employers to fire employees for their opinions or speech. New York’s protections for workers are more limited, but one safeguard is a law that prohibits employers from firing people for “legal recreational activities.” The law, which began as a bill intended to protect cigarette smokers from being fired for tobacco use, ended up providing broader protection. The law cites a few examples of legal recreational activities: sports, hobbies, exercise, reading, watching television.

But recreation is “highly subjective,” said an appellate lawyer, Joseph Pace, who has written about the issue, and New York courts have said little about online activities. “At the moment, it’s an open question whether blogging and tweeting will be deemed protected ‘recreational activity,’” Mr. Pace wrote in an email.

The lawsuit could put NYU Langone under the microscope in the widening debate.

Dr. Neel’s court filings include several emails that expressed pro-Israel opinions sent among top NYU Langone officials denigrating other universities across the country for how they responded to protests and student demands related to the war.

In one email, a top hospital official wrote something insulting about the president of Harvard. In another email, Dr. Robert Grossman, the longtime chief executive of the hospital, called Stanford a piece of excrement and said that the University of Pennsylvania was “similarly feculent.”

Dr. Grossman — who is such a significant figure at the hospital that New York University’s medical school is named after him — also seemed to suggest that N.Y.U. students who protested against Israel should face punishment. “They should take away their scholarships,” Dr. Grossman wrote in a message to Dr. Neel in October.

Dr. Neel’s lawyer, Mr. Williams, said that his client’s online postings were “tepid” compared to views some hospital leaders shared in their emails to one another. “Grossman was suggesting they take away scholarships, when all Ben was doing was challenging those who celebrate the deaths of innocent Israeli citizens,” he said.

In a statement, NYU Langone said Dr. Neel’s decision to share those emails was just him “lashing out for being held accountable.”

“The emails referenced in the suit were among colleagues and Dr. Neel is now making them public in an effort to pressure NYU Langone,” the statement said."
210,210,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/23/world/middleeast/israel-palestinian-prisoner-release.html,"As soon as the Tanji siblings heard that their youngest sister, Walaa, could be released from Israeli prison, they began frantically preparing for her return.

They arranged transportation for family members scattered across the Israeli-occupied West Bank. They rented plastic chairs to accommodate the crowds that would come to greet her. A friend even flew in from Canada to be there.

“We were so happy,” said Nagham Tanji, Walaa’s older sister. “My sisters and I could not wait for the sun to rise and for this day to come.”

The family was among many on both sides of the conflict that were hopeful after the announcement of a deal to release about 50 hostages held in Gaza and about 150 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, paired with a temporary cease-fire. Then came some delays, which dampened hopes. But on Thursday came an announcement that the exchange would begin on Friday — and that day the Palestinian Authority’s Commission for Prisoners’ Affairs confirmed that Walaa would be among the first 39 prisoners to be freed.

Speaking to The New York Times on Thursday, Ms. Tanji said: “Praise be to God, who made the deal happen. Patience is the key to relief. Now I want to start arranging again for her reception.”

Walaa Tanji, 26, was detained by Israel over a year ago at her home in the Balata refugee camp on the outskirts of Nablus, along with two other women. Israel’s military accused the three of planning an attack on an Israeli checkpoint and said it had found firearms in a car they were using. Ms. Tanji said that her sister was innocent and that she had yet to be charged or sentenced.

Even if Walaa had been released on Thursday, the reception would not have been possible.

Israeli forces started raiding the refugee camp early Thursday, and violent clashes erupted, killing one Palestinian and wounding three others, according to Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s news agency. The Israeli military has been carrying out nightly raids across the West Bank since the Hamas attack in Israel on Oct. 7, saying they are part of a counterterrorism operation to apprehend wanted Palestinians.

Ms. Tanji said that Walaa’s home was among those raided and severely damaged by Israeli forces. “We can’t think about the prisoner release deal now because of the horror we have been living since the raid started,” she said.

The agreement reached by Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, would also grant people in the enclave at least four days of calm after a relentless Israeli bombardment that health officials say has killed over 12,000 Palestinians. The bombing began in retaliation for the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7 that Israel says killed about 1,200 people.

Thirty-nine prisoners were set to be freed on Friday, the first day of exchanges. They include Rawan Abu Ziadeh, 29, who has been in an Israeli prison for over eight years.

“The wait has been very tough,” her older sister, Buthaina Abu Ziadeh, told The Times on Thursday. “When she comes out, I just want to hug her and hold her tight.”

Rawan Abu Ziadeh, who is from the village of Baytillu near Ramallah, was arrested in 2015 at the age of 20 and is serving a nine-year sentence after she was convicted of stabbing and lightly wounding an Israeli soldier.

Ms. Abu Ziadeh said the family had not been expecting Rawan to be on the list because she was set to be released in seven months: “She basically served her entire sentence, even if she is released now.”

The long-awaited reunion would not be what the family had hoped for, said Ms. Abu Ziadeh. “We’ve been eagerly awaiting this day,” she said. “But the joy will be incomplete because of all the pain in Gaza.”"

The Qatari government, which has brokered negotiations between Israel and Hamas, said a four-day pause in fighting in Gaza would begin this morning, followed by the hostage and prisoner releases. The events could lead to a significant diplomatic breakthrough in the war, now in its seventh week. Here’s the latest.

Israel and Hamas have been negotiating to clinch the final details of the agreement to exchange at least 50 women and children held in Gaza for 150 Palestinian women and minors imprisoned in Israeli jails. The agreement was announced on Wednesday, but the talks have snagged on key details, underscoring the fragility of the deal and the intense mutual mistrust.

Continued fighting: Israeli airstrikes and ground troops pummeled northern Gaza amid the countdown to the pause in fighting. Numerous clashes were reported in Jabaliya, an area just north of Gaza City that Israeli officials have called a stronghold of Hamas.

Details: A spokesman for Qatar’s foreign ministry told reporters that the pause in fighting would begin at 7 a.m. Gaza time. A first group of 13 hostages would be released starting at 4 p.m. along with an undisclosed number of Palestinian prisoners."

The bodies were believed to be from Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, which Israeli troops seized last week, and Beit Hanoun, a city on the northeastern edge of Gaza. Israel returned the bodies to Palestinian authorities earlier this week.

They were removed from the shipping container on stretchers, as workers dug a trench with construction equipment and shovels. Journalists watched, but no family members were present. The bodies were unidentified except for numbers on the bags.

Workers then stacked them next to each other in the trench, their blue bags standing out against the red-orange soil."

On Oct. 7, Palestinian gunmen succeeded where even the Nazis could not.

Mr. Ridler, 91, who as an 11-year-old boy daringly escaped from a concentration camp in Eastern Europe, was killed while at home in Kibbutz Holit during the Hamas-led terror attack on southern Israel. He was one of 1,400 people killed in the rampage, in what officials have called the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.

“My father had his life finished at the hands of vile murderers,” Pnina Hendler, Mr. Ridler’s daughter, said in an interview. “That was his end.”

Elderly Holocaust survivors living in southern and central Israel recounted harrowing stories from the day of the attack — pressing their frail bodies against doors for hours to keep attackers out, seeing neighbors wrenched from homes by gunmen and watching videos of their descendants beaten, bound and brought to Gaza as hostages.

The grim synchronicity of survivors from one historic massacre being terrorized in another delivered an added blow to Israel’s national psyche, which was already bruised by a failure to prevent the attack.

The creation of a Jewish state was long in the making before the near extermination of European Jewry catalyzed Israel’s founding in 1948. Central to the country’s national identity is its role as safe haven and defender of the Jewish people. Beyond those who fled Europe to Israel in the wake of the Holocaust and World War II, the country became a harbor for hundreds of thousands of Jews who fled or were expelled from Arab countries after Israel’s founding. In the years since, it has provided a home to persecuted populations from the Soviet Union, Iran, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and other countries."
214,214,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/world/europe/germany-pro-palestinian-protests.html,"Since fleeing Syria a decade ago, Wafa Mustafa has spoken out for political prisoners at the United Nations, held vigils outside war crimes trials and chanted in solidarity with Iranians protesting their authoritarian government.

Her activism won attention and praise in Germany, her adopted country — until she took it to a protest in support of Palestinians.

Last month, Ms. Mustafa said the police approached her and a fellow activist in Berlin as they stood on the sidelines of a protest, which the authorities had banned, against the Israeli bombardment of Gaza. The two were not demonstrating, she said, but wore the black and white Palestinian scarf known as the kaffiyeh. The police pushed her friend to the ground, pinned him down for several minutes and arrested him.

She filmed the episode while demanding an explanation. Instead of getting an answer, she, too, was briefly detained, accused of resisting the police.

“What I saw in their eyes is similar to what I saw in the eyes of Assad regime forces,” Ms. Mustafa said, referring to Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian dictator. “I know it’s not the same, but that is how I felt,” she said. “When you look into their eyes, there is nothing. You cannot talk with them, you cannot discuss with them. You cannot ask them, ‘What are you doing?’”

Since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza, governments across Europe have grappled with how the conflict has played out in their own countries. Some, citing security fears, have imposed stiff restrictions on pro-Palestinian protests in particular or banned them altogether, raising concerns about the violation of civil liberties."

My name is David Brooks. I am a columnist for The New York Times. And I write about politics, I write about culture, I write about social science, and from time to time, I write about world events. Since October 7th, I’ve been thinking a lot about the spreading brutalism of our world.

We woke up on that day and saw horrific footage of massacres and violence. And since then, we’ve seen horrific footage of bombings in Gaza, scenes of horror.

Because the Middle East is so contentious, a lot of the brutalism is right here in our own country. And that’s the vicious debates we’re having. That’s the tearing down of the posters of the kidnapped. That’s people screaming at each other. And so the thing I’ve been wondering about is, how do we live in this brutal environment without being brutalized ourselves? How do we live in a way where we remain open-hearted and we don’t get calloused over by our own hatreds?

We’re not the first group of people to live through brutalistic times. So I wanted to learn from the wise people in the past, how do you stay humane in times that are inhumane? And so I went back to two intellectual and moral traditions. And those two traditions are symbolized by two cities, Athens and Jerusalem. And they’re different, these two traditions, but they each have resources upon which we can draw.

And so for example, the Greeks lived with constant warfare between their city-states. And they developed what you might call a tragic sensibility. And I think this sensibility taught them a couple of things. First, it taught them a sense of humility, that our accomplishments are tenuous. We can’t really control our destinies, and we just have to face that. Humility is not thinking lowly of yourself. It’s seeing yourself accurately.

Second, suspect rage. If you go back to “The Iliad,” the great work by Homer, the word “rage” is in the very first sentence. And we see characters, like Agamemnon and Achilles, who are being stupid because they’re filled with rage. And if you look around the world today at the protests and the rallies, you see so much rage. The Greeks would say to those people who are filled with self righteous anger, sure, it feels delicious to be filled with rage, but you’re blinding yourself to reality. You’re simplifying the world. You’re desensitizing yourself to the horror that is all around you.

Another tradition that I think can teach us a very important set of lessons is centered around the city of Jerusalem and the three Abrahamic faiths. And these faiths emphasize what you might call recognition. And that’s the idea that every human being, from birth, needs to be seen and recognized and respected. And so one of the great things you can gift to another person is the gift of seeing them, the gift of paying attention. And so the Abrahamic traditions teach us to lead with love, even in hard times.

And so in dangerous times, your instinct is not to want to cast a just and loving attention on others because it seems soft. It seems like you’re leaving yourself vulnerable. And indeed, you are. It’s dangerous to be gentle and open-hearted in hard times, but it’s also dangerous to shut off your heart.

The Greek tradition is big on prudence and how to be skeptical. The Jerusalem tradition, on the other hand, is very big on empathy, very big on compassion. It orients you not to the most powerful people in society, but the people who are hurting the most. Can you hold these two mentalities in one single brain? Well, Max Weber, the philosopher, asked this very question in a famous essay called “Politics as a Vocation.” He said, can you be warm-hearted, and also rational and cautious?

I tried to think, how does this play out in my own life? And a couple of days ago, I was doomed scrolling through social media. And I was looking at all these images from the Middle East. And I was getting disturbed, disturbed, disturbed. And then I flicked down my social media feed, and I see an old video of James Baldwin being interviewed."
217,217,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/23/world/middleeast/gaza-families-israel.html,"Like many people around the world with families in Gaza who are anxious for news of their loved ones, wondering if they are still alive, whether they are hungry or hurt, Reem Alfranji is also consumed with guilt.

Even drinking a glass of water — a simple act at her home in Jordan, but a luxury for those trapped in the besieged enclave, like her mother — makes her feel guilty, Ms. Alfranji said. “Every time I drink this water, I feel I wish I could pass one cup for my mom,” she said.

The people of the Gaza Strip have been living for weeks under constant bombardment, cut off from supplies of food, water and medicine. Communications are also frequently disrupted, so those living outside the territory can find out about their families there only through sporadic text messages with WhatsApp or phone calls. They are desperate for any signs their loved ones are alive. Some say they barely sleep. Others barely eat.

Many grew up in Gaza and know what it is like to run from an airstrike, or how shattered glass turns into shrapnel. And while they know they can’t stop the bombardments, some said they wished they were there with their families, knowing how much they are suffering.

More than 12,000 people — including about 5,000 children — have been killed in Gaza as of Nov. 22, according to the health ministry in the enclave. Israel launched its military campaign against Gaza in response to terrorist attacks by Hamas, the group that runs the enclave, on Oct. 7. Israel says that about 1,200 people were killed and 240 hostages abducted in those attacks."

I had a good, productive, candid meeting with Prime Minister al-Sudani. And there were really two areas of focus for me in that meeting. The first was to reaffirm our commitment to our partnership with Iraq. The threats coming from militia that are aligned with Iran are totally unacceptable, and we will take every necessary step to protect our people. We’re not looking for conflict with Iran; we’ve made that very clear. But we’ll do what’s necessary to protect our personnel, be they military or civilian.

The former official, Stuart Seldowitz, 64, faces charges that include aggravated harassment and several counts of stalking, according to the police.

The charges were brought after the vendor, whom the police did not name but identified as a 24-year-old man, told the police that a person had approached him several times while he was working and had made Islamophobic comments, causing him to feel “afraid and annoyed.”

In several videos posted on social media, Mr. Seldowitz was shown photographing the vendor, threatening to send his picture to “friends in Immigration” and making Islamophobic remarks.

In one clip, Mr. Seldowitz calls the vendor “ignorant” for not speaking English, and goes on to make derisive comments about Islam’s founder, the Prophet Muhammad. In another, after a brief interaction about children being killed, Mr. Seldowitz says: “If we killed 4,000 Palestinian kids, you know what? It wasn’t enough.”

According to the police, Mr. Seldowitz lives a few blocks from the halal cart’s usual location on the Upper East Side. Attempts to reach him on Wednesday night were unsuccessful.

In a phone interview on Tuesday, Mr. Seldowitz said that he was not Islamophobic and that he had targeted the vendor only after he expressed support for Hamas. The videos do not depict any comments by the vendor beyond his asking Mr. Seldowitz to leave and saying he would call the police.

“At that point, I got rather upset and I’ve said things to him, that in retrospect, I probably regret, though — that I do regret,” Mr. Seldowitz said on Tuesday. “Instead of focusing in on him and what he said, I expanded into insulting his religion and so on.”

Mr. Seldowitz said he had held several positions in both Democratic and Republican administrations, including acting director for the National Security Council’s South Asia Directorate and a post in the U.S. State Department’s Office of Israel and Palestinian Affairs. He no longer holds any government positions, he said.

The incident came as tensions have escalated between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel groups in the weeks since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7. In New York City, there have been almost daily demonstrations about the war and increases in both anti-Islamic and antisemitic hate crimes, and some angry encounters have gone viral.

In social media posts on Tuesday, both Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul denounced Mr. Seldowitz’s behavior, calling his remarks “vile.”

Mr. Adams wrote: “Islamophobia is hate. Plain and simple. This vile, disrespectful rhetoric has no home in our city.”

Julie Menin, a city councilwoman representing the Upper East Side, said in an interview on Wednesday that the incident was “wholly and totally unacceptable” and had upset the local community and that she was glad to hear Mr. Seldowitz was in custody.

“This individual targeted this street vendor day after day after day, threatened the vendor, clearly committed hate speech that was violent in nature and contained threats,” she said.

Society was on a “downward spiral,” the president, Thomas Bach, suggested. He had never before seen so much “confrontation, division and polarization.” He rued the rising “scourge of war and violence.”

Then, as diplomats elsewhere in the building discussed prisoner swaps in Gaza and as soldiers continued to die in the muddy fields of eastern Ukraine, Mr. Bach offered what he saw as a salve: the Olympic truce. The resolution, revived every two years by Olympic leaders and adopted enthusiastically by the U.N. member nations, optimistically calls for the cessation of violence worldwide during the weeks of the Olympic Games, the next version of which will open in July in France.

“In these difficult times,” Mr. Bach said on Tuesday, “this resolution is our opportunity to send an unequivocal signal to the world: Yes, we can come together, even in times of wars and crises. Yes, we can join hands and work together for a better future.”"

A 9-year-old snatched while visiting a friend’s house for a sleepover. A 3-year-old whose last memory of her parents was seeing them both murdered. And an infant, now all of 10 months, who has spent about a tenth of his life in captivity.

They are among the more than 30 children abducted from their homes and taken to Gaza during the Hamas-led assault on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Their faces have appeared on signs at marches in Israel and on fliers posted in cities around the world. And their plight has both galvanized a nation at war and forced Israel’s leaders to negotiate, albeit indirectly, with Hamas, the armed group they have vowed to destroy.

About 240 people were abducted by gunmen that day. Among them were individuals gravely injured in the attack or who suffered from chronic illnesses, infants and grandparents, peace activists and soldiers, citizens of Israel and foreign nationals.

“Each one of them is a person, not a number or a statistic,” said Eylon Keshet, a cousin of Kfir Bibas, the now 10-month-old. “Each one is a part of our lives and has dreams and ambitions.”

The captive children, especially, have had an immeasurable emotional impact on the traumatized country. Their fate has put the hostages at the center of the national agenda, complicating the military’s war strategy in Gaza and dividing the government about whether a deal to secure the release of at least 50 captives goes far enough and if the agreed pause in fighting would spell a premature end of the war and leave Hamas intact.

At least 36 children and teenagers, ranging in age from infancy to the final year of high school, are being held in Gaza. Now, for the first time since the war began, a deal to release dozens of the hostages is at hand, raising the hopes of the nation but creating a special kind of agony for the families desperate to learn if their relatives will be among those freed. Almost a day after the deal was announced, the families had yet to receive any information from the authorities.

“I am feeling like yesterday and the day before, only worse,” said Yael Engel Lichi, the aunt of Ofir Engel, a 12th-grader kidnapped on Oct. 7 from Kibbutz Be’eri while visiting his girlfriend.

“We are at the point of collapse,” she added.

Some, but perhaps not all, of the children are expected to be among the first hostages released in the coming days under a deal announced on Wednesday. The publicized details of the agreement include a brief pause in fighting and the phased release of at least 50 hostages in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.

Little is known about the children’s whereabouts or well-being, and Hamas, the dominant Palestinian force in Gaza, has denied the Red Cross access to them. It is presumed that some are being held beneath Gaza’s streets in the group’s warren of tunnels and underground chambers.

Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, who was among just four hostages released by Hamas early in the conflict, described being marched into a network of damp subterranean tunnels under Gaza that she likened to “a spider web.”

Hamas has said that it does not hold all the captives, raising questions about its ability to free everyone. Islamic Jihad, another armed group in Gaza, released the hostage video of Yagil Yaakov, 12, who was captured along with his brother Or, 16."
223,223,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/world/middleeast/us-israel-bomb-equipment-sale.html,"The U.S. State Department has approved a $320 million sale to Israel of equipment for kits that turn unguided bombs into more precise, GPS-guided munitions, according to a letter sent by the department to Congress that was obtained by The New York Times.

The order comes on top of an earlier one for the same equipment that was valued at almost $403 million.

Israel has been using the kits during its bombing campaign in Gaza. According to the Gaza health ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government in the enclave, the Israeli strikes have resulted in the deaths of about 10,000 Palestinians, 40 percent of whom are young children and teens.

Israel has ordered more munitions from the United States alongside the equipment for guided bomb kits. Modern militaries generally add the guidance systems on their bombs with the goal of minimizing civilian casualties, although the damage can still be devastating, especially in urban areas.

Israel’s arsenal of air munitions is made up largely of 1,000- and 2,000-pound bombs, among the largest used by any military force. Israel dropped at least two 2,000-pound bombs in an airstrike on Oct. 31 on the dense Jabaliya neighborhood of Gaza. That strike killed dozens of people and injured many more, according to Gazan authorities and hospital officials.

Israel says it had successfully targeted a senior Hamas commander who helped plan the Oct. 7 attacks launched from Gaza, in which Hamas fighters and other armed men killed what Israel says was more than 1,400 people, most of them Israeli civilians, and abducted more than 240 others. Hamas denies that any of its commanders were in the Jabaliya area at the time of the Oct. 31 strike.

The State Department happened to send its letter on the new sale of bomb equipment to congressional offices on the day of that strike on Jabaliya. The letter says that Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, a weapons maker owned by Israel’s Defense Ministry, is paying $320 million for equipment and services for “Spice Family Gliding Bomb Assemblies,” a reference to a type of precision bomb kit made by Rafael. The seller of the equipment is Rafael USA, an American company based in Bethesda, Md., that has links to the Israeli enterprise.

The sale is one in which a foreign entity is purchasing armament directly from an American company rather than through the U.S. government, so the State Department is only required to disclose its approval in narrow channels. The congressional register notes the State Department filed the letter on Oct. 31, but the letter is not available on any public congressional websites or on the State Department’s site.

The letter was sent from Naz Durakoglu, the assistant secretary for legislative affairs, to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as to the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, both of which monitor the State Department’s approval of weapons sales.

The Israeli request for authorization to buy the $320 million of bomb equipment was placed earlier this year and had gone through an informal review process with the congressional committees, but had not received final State Department approval before the Oct. 7 attacks, said Josh Paul, a recent State Department official who worked in the political-military bureau, which oversees weapons sales.

The earlier order placed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems for the same type of equipment, and valued at almost $403 million, was approved by the department on Feb. 5, according to the letter."
224,224,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/world/middleeast/gaza-cease-fire-israel-war.html,"Residents of the Gaza Strip greeted the news of a temporary cease-fire with mixed emotions on Wednesday, expressing hope for a respite in Israel’s relentless bombardment but concern that the brief pause did not mean an end to the war.

“There’s a little bit of relief,” Ahmed Nassar, a 27-year-old taxi driver, said in a phone interview, adding that he hoped the deal would not fall through. “God willing, at midnight we will see it.”

The start of the cease-fire — which would allow for the release of 50 hostages held in Gaza and 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel — was to be announced within 24 hours and last for at least four days, said the government of Qatar, which helped lead the negotiations. The pause in fighting would also allow the delivery of more aid and fuel for civilians in Gaza, Qatar said.

Mr. Nassar, who fled his northern Gaza neighborhood of Jabaliya and is now living in the central part of the strip, said the deal raised the prospect that a longer cease-fire could come in the next few weeks, which could allow his family to go back and check on their home.

But Israeli officials have signaled that the war aimed at eradicating Hamas, which rules Gaza, will go on. For now, they have said, the 1.7 million Palestinians displaced by the fighting will not be allowed to return to their homes during the pause.

The four-day pause is “not guaranteeing the end of the military operations in the Gaza Strip,” said Bisan Owda, who has been documenting the war on social media. “This period is not enough to pull the dead bodies from under the rubble and bury them, to search for the missing people, to open the roads, to treat the injured.”"
225,225,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/opinion/israel-palestinians-arabs.html,"I confess that as a longtime observer of the Arab-Israeli conflict, I aggressively avoid both the “From the river to the sea” activists on the pro-Palestinian left and the similarly partisan zealots on the “Greater Israel” Zionist right — not just because I find their exclusivist visions for the future abhorrent but also because the reporter in me finds them so blind to the complexities of the present.

They aren’t thinking about the Jewish mother in Jerusalem who told me in one breath how she just got a gun license to protect her kids from Hamas, and in the next about how much she trusted her kids’ Palestinian Arab teacher, who rushed her children to the school bomb shelter during a recent Hamas air raid. They aren’t thinking about Alaa Amara, the Israeli Arab shop owner from Taibe, who donated 50 bicycles to Jewish kids who survived the Hamas attack on their border communities on Oct. 7, only to see his shop torched, apparently by hard-line nationalist Israeli Arab youth, a few days later, only to see a crowdfunding campaign in Hebrew and English raise more than $200,000 to help him rebuild that same shop just a few days after that.

Over the last half-century, I have seen Palestinians and Israelis do terrible things to one another. But this episode that began with the barbaric Hamas attack on Israelis, including women, little kids and soldiers in communities alongside Gaza, and the Israeli retaliation against Hamas fighters embedded in Gaza that has also killed, wounded and displaced so many thousands of Palestinian civilians — from newborns to the elderly — is surely the worst since the 1947 U.N. partition days.

But those on all sides who read this column know that I am not one for keeping score. My focus is always on how to get out of this eye-for-an-eye, tooth-for-a-tooth horror show before everyone is left blind and toothless.

To that end, I devoted a lot of time on my trip to Israel and the West Bank this month observing and probing the actual day-to-day interactions among Israeli Arabs and Jews. These are always complex, sometimes surprising, occasionally depressing — and, more often than you might expect, uplifting — experiences. Because they reveal enough seeds of coexistence scattered around that one can still dream the impossible dream — that we might one day have a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians living between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River.

So, this Thanksgiving week, I ask you to spare a few moments with me to reflect on some of these people, including some of the extraordinary acts of rescue that they committed on Oct. 7. They will give you more faith in humanity than the headlines around this story would ever suggest.

To put it another way, a friend once described my worldview as a cross between Thomas Hobbes and Walter Mondale. For several days on my trip, I let out my inner Mondale to chase some rays of hope shooting through the darkness.

It began soon after I arrived in Tel Aviv, when I sat down with perhaps the most courageous Israeli political leader today, Mansour Abbas. Abbas is a Palestinian Arab citizen of Israel who happens to be a devout Muslim and a member of Israel’s parliament, where he leads the important United Arab List party. Abbas’s voice is even more vital now because he did not respond to the Hamas terrorism with silence. Abbas understands that while it’s right to be outraged at the pain Israel is inflicting on Gaza’s civilians, reserving all of your outrage for Gaza’s pain creates suspicion among Jews in Israel and worldwide, who notice when not a word is uttered about the Hamas atrocities that triggered this war.

The first thing Abbas said to me about the Hamas onslaught was this: “No one can accept what happened on that day. And we cannot condemn it and say ‘but’ — that word ‘but’ has become immoral.” (Recent polls show overwhelming Israeli Arab condemnation of the Hamas attack.)

Abbas sees the complexities lived by that Israeli Jewish mother in Jerusalem who never lost trust in her kids’ Palestinian Arab teacher, and by that Israeli Arab bicycle shop owner who spontaneously reached out a hand to ease the pain of Jewish children he’d never met. At the same time, though, Abbas spoke about the searing pain Israeli Palestinian Arabs and Bedouins feel at seeing their relatives pummeled and killed in Gaza.

“One of the hardest things today is to be an Israeli Arab,” Abbas said to me. “The Arab Israeli feels the pain twice — once as an Arab and once as an Israeli.”

That’s the thing about this neighborhood: If you only look at one group or the other under a microscope, you want to cry — the brutal massacre of Jews, the harsh treatment of Palestinians by Jewish supremacist settlers. The list is endless. But if you look at their stories through a kaleidoscope, observing the complexity of their interactions, you can see hope. If you want to report accurately about Israelis and Palestinians, always bring a kaleidoscope.

Which brings me to the stories of the Israeli Bedouin Arabs and Oct. 7."
226,226,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/us/politics/biden-hostage-talks-israel-hamas.html,"Aides said the president was also hopeful that the hostage release could be an early step toward a broader peace in the region once the immediate crisis ends. In an opinion article published in The Washington Post on Sunday, Mr. Biden described how far his ambitions stretch beyond the four-day pause in fighting agreed to on Tuesday.

“Our goal should not be simply to stop the war for today,” he wrote. “It should be to end the war forever, break the cycle of unceasing violence, and build something stronger in Gaza and across the Middle East so that history does not keep repeating itself.”

Mr. Biden and his top aides have repeatedly said they do not tell Israel how to respond to the slaughter of 1,200 people inside their country, and Mr. Netanyahu made it clear on Tuesday that he intended to resume military operations against Hamas as soon as the hostages were freed in accordance with the deal.

“The war will continue,” Mr. Netanyahu said.

But some senior American officials have signaled they would not be disappointed if the pause became a more permanent cease-fire. If the White House tries to use the hostage deal to press for a longer-term cease-fire and start moving toward the bigger questions about occupation and a two-state solution, that could put Mr. Biden on another collision course with Mr. Netanyahu when the fighting is scheduled to resume.

A top administration official, who briefed reporters on Tuesday in the hours before the deal was finalized, said the pause in fighting was a step toward an eventual push for peace. But the official cautioned that such a possibility was a long way off.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a deal that had not yet been finalized.

In the short term, the president and his aides say they are focused on ensuring that Hamas lives up to the promises the militant group made during weeks of negotiations that often seemed destined to fail.

The first sign of progress came in late October, when U.S. officials received word through intermediaries in Qatar and Egypt that Hamas could accept a deal to release women and children. In return, they wanted Israel to free Palestinian prisoners, pause the fighting, and delay a ground invasion.

With Israeli troops massing outside Gaza, officials in Israel and the United States debated whether to accept the deal. Israeli officials did not think Hamas was serious about the offer and refused to delay the ground offensive. Hamas refused to provide any proof of life about the hostages. Negotiations stalled.

At the White House, Mr. Biden and his foreign policy team kept pressing. On Nov. 14, hope swelled again after Mr. Netanyahu called the president to say he could accept the latest offer from Hamas. But just hours after the call, Israeli military forces stormed Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, which they said served as a Hamas command center. Suddenly, communications between Hamas and the officials in Qatar and Egypt went silent. When Hamas resurfaced hours later, they made it clear: The deal was off.

For several days, the militant group demanded that Israeli troops withdraw from the hospital, which Israel refused. It took several days for the talks to resume, following a call from Mr. Biden to the emir of Qatar.

Administration officials continued pressing Israel and, through the intermediaries, Hamas. After Mr. Biden’s call, top aides, including the director of the C.I.A., met with the emir in Qatar to go over the latest draft — a six-page text with detailed steps for implementation on both sides.

Within a week, the diplomatic pressure paid off. On Tuesday evening, as the Israeli cabinet took its final vote to approve the deal, Mr. Biden headed out of Washington for a five-day Thanksgiving vacation with his family on the island of Nantucket.

The Israeli decision, announced by Mr. Netanyahu’s office, would allow for a pause of at least four days in the fighting in Gaza. If it holds, it will be the longest halt in hostilities since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks prompted Israel to begin its bombardment of Gaza.

In a statement on Tuesday night, Mr. Biden pledged to work with regional leaders “to ensure this deal is carried through in its entirety,” adding, “It is important that all aspects of this deal be fully implemented.”

But even with the deal in place, Mr. Biden faces challenges ahead. There are still Americans being held hostage in Gaza, and the tensions in the United States, and within his own party, show few signs of diminishing.

Officials said they were keenly aware that the horror for the families of those still in captivity in Gaza will not end until their loved ones are home.

For Mr. Biden, it could not happen soon enough.

“As president, I have no higher priority than ensuring the safety of Americans held hostage around the world,” Mr. Biden said in his statement, adding, “Today’s deal should bring home additional American hostages, and I will not stop until they are all released.”"
227,227,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/world/europe/putin-ukraine-russia-war-g20.html,"In his first address to officials from the Group of 20 leading economies since his invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir V. Putin on Wednesday rebuffed criticism that the war’s aggression was “shocking” and accused Western nations of a double standard because of their response to the conflict between Israel and Hamas.

Appearing at a virtual meeting of the G20, he called the war in Ukraine “a tragedy” that must be stopped and said Russia had “never refused” to engage in peace negotiations.

For Mr. Putin, it was a rare interaction with Western leaders since the start of the war last year. It was also the first time he had to listen to direct, public criticism of the invasion at an international event. Once he had a chance to respond, Mr. Putin could not hide his irritation.

“Some colleagues already in their speeches were saying that they were shocked by the ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine,” Mr. Putin said. “Military actions are always a tragedy of specific people, families and the country as a whole and we need to think about ways to stop this tragedy.”

He delivered his eight-minute address at an event hosted by India as a follow-up to an in-person G20 gathering in September.

The plight of civilians in Gaza, which he called “an extermination,” was also shocking, he said, implying that the West was willing to overlook the aggression there. He also repeated Russia’s frequent line that Kyiv had acted aggressively against its own people in the Donbas in 2014, calling that shocking.

It was another example of a tactic Mr. Putin and other top Russian officials have resorted to in recent years: accusing the West of transgressions, often bending reality, as a way to deflect attention from their own.

Mr. Putin referred to the fighting in Ukraine as a war, instead of using the Kremlin’s euphemism of “special military operation.”

“I understand that this war, and the loss of life cannot but shock,” he said.

Mr. Putin repeated Russia’s official line that the Kremlin was ready to negotiate and blamed Ukraine for rejecting talks. “Russia has never refused peace talks with Ukraine,” Mr. Putin said. “It was Ukraine, not Russia, which publicly announced that it was withdrawing from the negotiating process.”

But for all his talk of negotiation, Mr. Putin has shown no willingness to relent from his goal of bringing Ukraine back under Russian dominance, let alone to reverse his declaration last year that four southern and eastern Ukrainian regions are part of Russia — including territory that Russia’s military does not control.

Ukraine has cited the need to liberate all of its territory occupied by Russia before it can negotiate for peace.

Mr. Putin also listed various grievances Russia holds against the West, such as the 2014 overthrow in Ukraine of its Russia-leaning president, Viktor F. Yanukovych.

The Russian leader’s address highlighted how the world has been fractured by the war.

When the G20 summit took place in September, the absence of Mr. Putin — as well as China’s leader Xi Jinping — was a clear indication of the breakdown of global consensus. While President Biden attended for the United States, Russia was represented by its foreign minister, Sergei V. Lavrov, and China by its premier, Li Qiang.

The war in Ukraine had cast a long shadow over India’s hosting of the G20 this year, with disagreements over the conflict making consensus difficult.

India, which was rotational host of the group this year, tried to keep the agenda focused on issues ranging from rising global debt to climate financing. Its leadership of the summit tested India’s balancing act between its historic ally, Moscow, and its growing relations with the United States and Europe as never before.

Delhi wanted to focus on the conflict’s economic toll on poorer nations. But during negotiations, Western nations, led by the United States, wanted to force condemnation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine into discussions on every issue."

229,229,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/opinion/ceasefire-israel-gaza.html,"This has been updated to reflect news developments.

Of all that’s been said and written about the war between Israel and Hamas, nothing has cut through the mental fog quite so brightly as a remark this month from Hillary Clinton on “The View.”

“Remember,” the former secretary of state said, “there was a cease-fire on Oct. 6 that Hamas broke by their barbaric assault on peaceful civilians and their kidnapping, their killing, their beheading, their terrible, inhumane savagery.”

Those three words — “that Hamas broke” — aren’t trivial. They give the lie to the “Cease-Fire Now” mirage, or imposture, that has become a rallying cry at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. They are at the heart of what the war is about, and the key to how it can end. And they are the bright dividing line between those who would allow Hamas to get away with murder, and those who would refuse.

Why should it matter that it was Hamas that broke the cease-fire when Palestinian civilians are being killed in large numbers by Israeli bombs and bullets? Those saying that it shouldn’t matter argue that questions of culpability become secondary, if not irrelevant, when kids’ lives are at stake. If Israel has the power to save those kids by halting its campaign, goes the argument, then it has a moral obligation to do so.

But wait: Doesn’t Hamas also have the power? Hamas has a long record of firing those rockets from the vicinity of schools. It has sought to prevent ordinary Gazans from obeying evacuation orders, deliberately putting them at increased risk. It hides in a vast network of tunnels while civilians must fend for themselves above ground.

The Israeli government and Hamas agreed on Wednesday morning to a four-day cease-fire in which Hamas would free 50 of the hostages. But Hamas did that only because it’s under intense military pressure. It could get a real and lasting cease-fire for the people of Gaza — and probably safe passage out of the territory for many of its members — in exchange for releasing all the hostages, surrendering its arms and renouncing its rule in favor of some other Arab power.

That Hamas has done none of these things isn’t shocking: It’s a terrorist death cult. What’s shocking is that people in the Cease-Fire Now crowd don’t appear to have much interest in making any demands of Hamas equivalent to those they make of Israel.

They want Israel to stop firing. But do you often hear them insisting that Hamas return the favor? They want Israel to provide Gaza with humanitarian relief in the form of electricity, fuel and other goods. But I haven’t seen those protesters in the street demanding that Hamas provide Israel with humanitarian relief in the form of immediately freeing all hostages. They claim to want a “free Palestine” for all its people. But I never hear them criticize Hamas’s dictatorship, or its contempt for the civil and human rights of its own people, or its members’ avowedly antisemitic boasts of slaughtering Jews.

There is a buried, unwitting compliment to Israel in this asymmetry — an assumption that, as a Western democracy, the Jewish state is susceptible to moral suasion, public shaming, or at least diplomatic pressure in a way Hamas and its patrons in Iran aren’t.

Yet that compliment is rarely accompanied with even a gesture of respect for Israel’s grief, or the legitimacy of its grievance with Hamas, or its need to keep its citizens safe, or even its right to exist as a sovereign state. Even when Israel’s notional right to self-defense is briefly acknowledged, every exercise of it is immediately deemed a war crime, whatever the evidence.

For Israelis, what “Cease-Fire Now” means is “Surrender Now.” No wonder they decline to heed the call.

What about for Palestinians — women, children and noncombatant men for whom the calls for a cease-fire are supposedly intended? Would they benefit? In the short term, of course: Palestinian lives would be saved if Israel held its fire.

But a cease-fire wouldn’t spare just civilians. It would spare, and embolden, the main fighting force of Hamas. It would also embolden terrorist allies like Hezbollah. That’s a virtual guarantee for future mass-casualty attacks against Israel, for ever-larger Israeli retaliation, and for deeper misery for the people of Gaza. No Israeli government of any political stripe is going to allow the territory to rebuild so long as Hamas remains in charge.

That gives a second meaning to “Cease-Fire Now”: Either a demand for Israel’s total capitulation, or a recipe for a perpetual cycle of violence between a terrorist group sworn to Israel’s destruction and a Jewish state that refuses to be destroyed. Whatever else one thinks of Israel, no country can be expected to sign its own death warrant by indulging those who, if given the chance, would annihilate it.

There are good intentions, if also ignorance and shortsightedness, among many of those demanding a cease-fire. But there is also the bottomless cynicism of others who accept, and even celebrate, Hamas as it uses living Gazans as human shields and dead Gazans as propaganda victories. The tragedy of these protests, like so many “antiwar” movements in the past, is that the naïve and earnest are again being manipulated as tools of the cunning and cruel.

Instead of Cease-Fire Now, we need Hamas’s Defeat Now. Only on that basis does a lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians alike have any chance to follow."

An agency spokesman, Richard Siklos, confirmed Tuesday that the agency no longer represented Sarandon but declined to elaborate.

Efforts to reach Sarandon for comment were not immediately successful.

Separately, Spyglass Media Group dropped Melissa Barrera from the cast of the “Scream” horror franchise after she posted incendiary comments on Instagram about Israel’s retaliation for the Hamas attacks.

“We have zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech,” Spyglass said in a statement on Tuesday.

Representatives for Barrera did not respond to requests for comment.

United Talent dropped Sarandon after she made remarks at a rally in New York City last week. “There are a lot of people that are afraid, afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country, so often subjected to violence,” she said at the rally, where she called for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, according to a video published by The New York Post.

Those remarks were criticized on social media; a former speechwriter for Israel’s delegation to the United Nations said on the X platform, formerly Twitter, that she had interpreted Sarandon’s remark as implying that Jews “have it coming — that we don’t deserve to live free from harassment and assault.” The Post characterized her remarks as an “anti-Jewish rant” in a headline."

But the Middle East, like a vortex, has pulled Washington back in. And for America’s partners in the Indo-Pacific, many of which already worry that the United States is not moving fast enough to counter Beijing, the sudden focus on Gaza — with Pentagon task forces, ramped-up U.S. weapons deliveries to Israel and rushed visits to Middle Eastern capitals — feels like a loss, delaying progress on some of their most critical challenges.

“What concerns us most is the diversion of the U.S. military’s resources from East Asia to Europe, to the Middle East,” Akihisa Nagashima, a lawmaker and former national security adviser in Japan, said at a strategy forum in Sydney, Australia, last week. “We really hope that conflict is completely finished pretty soon.”

American military commanders have said that no equipment has left the Indo-Pacific. And two top cabinet officials, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, will be crisscrossing Asia this week with messages of reassurance, making stops separately or together in India, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia.

Along the way, they most likely will hear a mix of views about Gaza, with India more supportive of Israel, Japan seeking a more balanced approach, and Indonesia, home of the world’s largest Muslim population, increasingly outraged by the thousands of civilians killed in the Israeli invasion that has followed Hamas’ assault on Israel."
232,232,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/world/hamas-prisoners-hostage-deal.html,"Negotiations around the release of Israeli women and children held hostage in Gaza have centered on an exchange for Palestinian women and minors held in Israeli prisons. The size of that group has grown quickly during the six weeks of war and upheaval since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, according to a Palestinian prisoners’ rights group.

The group, Addameer, says that about 200 boys, most of them teenagers, were in Israeli detention as of this week, along with about 75 women and five teenage girls. Before Oct. 7, about 150 boys and 30 women and girls were in Israeli prisons, it said, and since then, many other detentions have occurred, as well as many releases.

Addameer said that it compiled the figures using data from the Israel Prison Service, which administers the country’s jails, and information from the families of detained people.

Early Wednesday, the Israeli government and Hamas announced they would uphold a four-day cease-fire in Gaza to allow for the release of 50 hostages captured during Hamas’s assault last month on Israel and 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.

Many of the most recent arrests of Palestinians came during raids across the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where protests and violence have surged, including attacks on Palestinians by Israeli settlers. Israel has said that the arrests are part of a counterterror operation against Hamas in the West Bank.

There are also about 700 people missing from Gaza who are believed to be in Israeli prisons, but information on their whereabouts is murky, said Tala Nasir, a spokeswoman for Addameer. It was not clear how many of those people, if any, were women or minors. The Israeli military has said that it has apprehended 300 people in Gaza during the ground invasion that it claimed were connected to armed Palestinian groups, and that they “were brought into Israeli territory for further interrogations.”

Of the roughly 240 Israeli hostages taken to Gaza by Hamas and other armed groups, 33 are minors, the youngest of whom is 9 months old, according to the Israeli government. At least 62 are women, according to an organization formed by the hostages’ families. Four of the women being held hostage are Israeli soldiers, according to interviews with their family members and information gathered by a forum of the hostages’ families.

As of this week, the total number of what Addameer calls Palestinian political prisoners in Israel — including people from Gaza, the West Bank and Israel — was 7,000, up from about 5,000 before Oct. 7, according to Addameer. That includes more than 2,000 people held in “administrative detention,” meaning they are being held indefinitely without charges, it said.

Ms. Nasir said that her group defines that category as Palestinians arrested for offenses that are related to political activity and free speech rather than crimes like drugs. She added that Addameer had received many reports in recent weeks of people arrested on charges of incitement for their social media posts in Israel and the West Bank. Earlier this month, the Knesset passed an amendment to a counterterrorism law that criminalized the “consumption of terrorist materials.”

Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, said that it was monitoring 121 cases of arrests and detentions linked to social media posts, some which “merely contained expressions of solidarity with the Palestinian people in Gaza, or even verses shared from the Quran.”

Rights groups have long warned that Palestinian detainees are held without due process and face abuse and even torture. Military Court Watch, a nonprofit legal group, said last year that of the 100 Palestinian children detained by Israeli forces that it had interviewed, 74 percent reported physical abuse, and 42 percent said they were put in solitary confinement.

The women in Israeli detention include Ahed Tamimi, 22, a high-profile figure in the West Bank who was sentenced to prison in 2018 for slapping an Israeli soldier. Israeli officials accused her of her posting hate speech online; her family said the post was not hers.

Six Palestinian detainees who were held without charges have died in Israeli prisons in recent weeks, according to Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s news agency. One of them, Omar Daraghmeh, was a senior member of Hamas, the militant group said when his death was announced.

Israel and Hamas appeared to be edging close to a deal that would allow the release of some of the 240 captives held in Gaza in exchange for some Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The exchange would take place during what would be a brief pause in the war.

Here’s the latest.

The Israeli government said yesterday afternoon that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would hold an unusually intense sequence of meetings with cabinet ministers in the coming hours “in light of developments on the issue of the release of our hostages.” Netanyahu added that he hoped “we will have good news soon.” President Biden echoed that optimism, saying, “We’re now very close, very close.”

An Israeli official, speaking anonymously in order to discuss a sensitive matter, said the ministers were expected to vote on whether to approve a brief cease-fire that would allow for an exchange.

If a deal is approved, the hostages may not be released until tomorrow to allow for a 24-hour period for judicial review, Israeli officials said. And until an exchange of captives begins, the situation is likely to remain fluid."
237,237,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/nyregion/seldowitz-vendor-islamophobia-nyc.html,"A former State Department employee and national security official was recorded on video harassing a halal food vendor in Manhattan in recent weeks, calling the man a “terrorist.”

The former official, Stuart Seldowitz, was recorded in several videos posted on X, also known as Twitter, taking pictures of the vendor and berating him with Islamophobic comments. After a brief back-and-forth about children being killed, Mr. Seldowitz tells the man: “If we killed 4,000 Palestinian kids, you know what? It wasn’t enough.”

The vendor, who has not been identified, is heard on the videos asking Mr. Seldowitz to “please go” and saying that he would call the police.

The police said on Tuesday night that no reports had been filed against Mr. Seldowitz, but they confirmed that the commanding officer of the 19th Precinct was aware of the videos and that precinct personnel were monitoring the situation.

Recordings of the encounters spread online at a time when tensions have intensified between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups across the country since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7.

The tensions have been particularly acute in New York City, where there have been almost daily demonstrations and increases in both anti-Islamic and antisemitic hate crimes.

The video clips posted online show Mr. Seldowitz returning to the same location over several days — once at night and twice during the day — and each time refusing to leave.

He’s heard saying in one clip, “It’s a free country — it’s not like Egypt.” In the same clip, Mr. Seldowitz calls the vendor “ignorant” for not speaking English before continuing to make derisive comments about Islam's founder, the Prophet Muhammad.

The videos do not show any comments by the vendor or interactions that occurred before the clips start. Efforts to reach the vendor at his cart on Tuesday were unsuccessful.

According to Mr. Seldowitz, who said in a phone interview on Tuesday that he had not seen the videos, the episodes started after he asked the vendor if he was Egyptian. As the conversation progressed, the man expressed support for Hamas, Mr. Seldowitz said, though no such claims are captured on any of the videos that have been made public

“At that point, I got rather upset and I’ve said things to him, that in retrospect, I probably regret, though — that I do regret,” Mr. Seldowitz said. “Instead of focusing in on him and what he said, I expanded into insulting his religion and so on.”

When asked why he had continued to return to the vendor, Mr. Seldowitz said he had wanted to ask if the man was “still a supporter of Hamas,” adding that “I was upset at the fact that he was selling food in a neighborhood in New York.”

Despite being captured on video calling the religion’s holy figure “a rapist” several times, Mr. Seldowitz insisted that he was not Islamophobic.

“I’ve worked with Muslims,” he said, adding, “I have many people who are Muslims and Arabs and so on, who know me very well and who know that I’m not prejudiced against them.”

On Tuesday night, it was a busy scene in front of the cart, which sits steps from the 83rd Street exit of the 86th Street Q subway station. Despite the rain, crowds would intermittently emerge from the subway and form a short line of hungry travelers.

A man working in the cart, who did not want to give his name but said he was not the vendor in the videos, said he himself had encountered Mr. Seldowitz once last week and had called the police. The police came after 30 minutes, he said, but left, saying they couldn’t do anything. Since then, the man said, Mr. Seldowitz had returned twice and was recorded by the other vendor.

Mr. Seldowitz said he had held several positions in both Democratic and Republican administrations, including acting director for the National Security Council South Asia Directorate and a post in the U.S. State Department’s Office of Israel and Palestinian Affairs. He no longer holds any government positions, he said.

According to a November 2022 announcement by Gotham Government Relations, a Manhattan-based lobbying firm, Mr. Seldowitz was the group’s new foreign affairs chair. In a short biography that has since been taken down from the firm’s website, he is described as a three-time winner of the State Department’s Superior Honor Award.

According to David Schwartz, the firm’s president, Mr. Seldowitz was never an employee of Gotham Government Relations and was not registered — as far as Mr. Schwartz was aware — as a lobbyist for the firm.

“I’m personally outraged and offended by this language,” Mr. Schwartz said in a statement, adding, “Islamophobia and antisemitism have no place in our world and must be eradicated.”

Mr. Schwartz also said he wanted to offer legal representation, without charge, to the food vendor against the person who had “spewed such vile, hateful statements.”

sabrina tavernise

From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise, and this is “The Daily.” Israel’s war against Hamas has caused large-scale destruction in Gaza and a death toll that now stands at nearly 13,000 people, according to Gaza health officials. Now, as the war enters its seventh week, Israel finds itself under intense pressure from allies and from critics to justify its strategy. Today, my colleague Patrick Kingsley goes inside Gaza with the Israeli military to a hospital that’s at the heart of Israel’s argument. It’s Tuesday, November 21. So Patrick, late Thursday night, you were one of five journalists who were invited by the Israeli military to go inside Gaza to see, really for the first time, what things look like on the ground. So tell me how this trip came about and what your questions were going into it — what you wanted to understand.

patrick kingsley

The context was that Israel had just taken control of parts or most of a hospital that has been at the center of the discourse about Israel’s invasion of Gaza and basically become a proxy for a wider debate about the conduct of Israel’s airstrikes and its invasion.

sabrina tavernise

Right.

patrick kingsley

The hospital, Al-Shifa, is the largest in Gaza. And Israel has, since the start of its invasion, maintained that it conceals a secret Hamas military base and that therefore, the hospital, even though it is a civilian institution, must be captured in order to defeat Hamas and remove Hamas’s military capabilities. The war, as we know, has caused catastrophic loss of civilian life. Around 13,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, have been killed since the start of the war in Gaza. Many of them are civilians, many of them children, and to Palestinians and to many international observers, that is evidence of Israel’s indiscriminate targeting of civilians. But to Israel, there’s such a high civilian death toll because of Hamas, because Hamas embeds itself, they say, within civilian infrastructure, in or near schools or hospitals. And therefore, Israel, in response to the devastating raid on many of its southern towns and villages on October 7 that killed an estimated 1,200 people, has no choice but to target civilian areas. And the Shifa hospital is the embodiment of this debate, because it’s the largest hospital in Gaza. And if Israel can prove that it was military infrastructure, then many Israelis think that it will help justify and help sustain international support for its invasion. But if they can’t, then to Palestinians and others, it will prove their point that Israel’s conduct of the war is illegal and unjustified.

sabrina tavernise

So in a way, the hospital is about more than just a hospital, right? It’s about the logic that Israel is applying in the broader war.

patrick kingsley

Absolutely. So that was the context in which I woke up last Thursday. And we had a lot of questions, and the Israeli military agreed late in the afternoon to take me to see the hospital. It was not a decision we took lightly, not least because they did not want us to take pictures of the inside of one of the military vehicles that we were traveling in, and they didn’t want us to take pictures of the faces of most of the soldiers we were going with. And we were only going to be able to see the places that they wanted us to see, and we weren’t going to be able to talk to any Palestinians. So there were plenty of restrictions on our visit, but we decided it was worth it, because very few journalists have been able to enter Gaza since the start of the war. Those that are in Gaza have had their movements greatly restricted by airstrikes, the Israeli invasion itself as well as restrictions placed by Hamas. Dozens of Palestinian journalists have died trying to report on what’s going on. And we felt that whatever limited window we could get onto what was going on in Gaza, in particular at the hospital, would be worth it.

speaker 1 You are from what — patrick kingsley “New York Times.” speaker 1 “New York Times“? OK.

sabrina tavernise

So tell me the story of going inside Gaza to see this hospital.

patrick kingsley

We started off inside Israel itself, at the village of Be’eri.

patrick kingsley We are just getting into a Hummer, about to leave the Israeli village of Be’eri.

patrick kingsley

Which was one of the villages that was overrun by Hamas and its allies on October 7.

patrick kingsley We are driving in this Israeli military Jeep, down a bumpy farm road.

patrick kingsley

At a certain point, we were then taken to a second military vehicle — this time, an open-sided Jeep.

patrick kingsley And we’re joining a long, long convoy of dozens of military vehicles.

patrick kingsley

We then switched our phones onto flight mode, so that after entering Gaza, our phones couldn’t be picked up by any digital surveillance systems.

patrick kingsley We’re just crossing the border between Israel and Gaza. We’ve just passed through a gate in the fence that divides the Gaza Strip from the state of Israel.

patrick kingsley

And so several hours after we’d arrived at Kibbutz Be’eri, we were finally rumbling into Gaza through a gap in the same fence that Hamas penetrated on October 7, this time, heading into Gaza, rather than out of it, and this time, heading into darkness.

patrick kingsley Just the dim lights of the vehicles in the Israeli army convoy. And above us, stars in the sky.

patrick kingsley

In every village and town we then pass through, there was almost no light coming from the windows. So the convoy was a sort of silent juggernaut making its way through a silent, dark landscape. The first village we went to, we didn’t see much damage. But —

patrick kingsley We’re now passing a building that looks totally bombed out.

patrick kingsley

— as we kept on going —

patrick kingsley Three floors. The walls are almost totally destroyed.

patrick kingsley

— we could see buildings that felt like someone had taken a bite out of them.

patrick kingsley The roof appears to have fallen onto the ground floor, and the walls are given way.

patrick kingsley

Village after village seemed in total ruin.

patrick kingsley Its just ruin after ruin, destroyed house after destroyed house. Rubble upon rubble.

patrick kingsley

It was a kind of ghostly scene, not like the Gaza that I’ve come to know over the last decade of visits.

patrick kingsley I can smell burning.

patrick kingsley

There was no Palestinian to be seen. More than a million, we understand, have fled south, leaving most villages and most towns mostly empty.

patrick kingsley You know what kind of building this used to be? speaker 2 What? I don’t know. Hotel, I guess?

patrick kingsley

Gaza is a place of noise. It’s a place of light. It’s a place of life outside of wars. But on this night, shortly after midnight on Friday morning, it felt like a place of death.

patrick kingsley The last time I was here, in the late summer, there were beach resorts, cafes, people swimming in the sea, people drinking juice, drinking coffee in those cafes, watching the sunset. Now, I’m surrounded by ruins. [RADIO CHATTER]

sabrina tavernise

What happened next?

patrick kingsley

We got out of our Jeep, and —

patrick kingsley I’m now walking into the Namer, which is an armored vehicle, a bit like a tank but without a gun turret.

patrick kingsley

We entered a heavily armored personnel carrier.

patrick kingsley At a small ramp. I’m ducking.

patrick kingsley

And that showed that while Israel seems to have got the middle section of Gaza roughly under its control, it’s still fighting active battles in Gaza City. And they wanted to put us in this personnel carrier in order to guard against ambush. And several minutes later, we arrived on the edge of Al-Shifa hospital. And this was the destination, the final destination, of our brief journey into northern Gaza.

patrick kingsley We’re now leaving the armored vehicle, stepping out into the jet black night.

patrick kingsley

So the doorway to the armored personnel carrier slowly went down, a bit like a drawbridge to a medieval castle —

patrick kingsley — being led by special forces.

patrick kingsley

— creating a gangway from the inside of the vehicle to the ground.

patrick kingsley We’re told by a military spokesman that we’ve now entered the hospital. To be honest, I didn’t notice. We had to pick our way from the street through the rubble of a ruined building.

patrick kingsley

And we were ushered into a ruin on the edge of the hospital grounds. The hospital is not just a single building. It’s a sort of roughly square-shaped complex. And we arrived in what we were told was previously a cafeteria. And there, we met Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht, who’s the international spokesman for the Israeli army.

speaker 3 Watch your step. We’re not that safe here. You might hear some firing.

patrick kingsley

And we picked our way through the debris and out closer to the center of the hospital complex, towards a shaft.

speaker 3 — one of the entrances, shafts.

patrick kingsley

Large, wide shaft —

speaker 3 And you can see the cemented walls. You see it. This is a Hamas tunnel.

patrick kingsley

— that they said that they had discovered earlier that day, underneath a car that they said had contained weapons and explosives and had belonged to Hamas militants.

speaker 3 I just want you to get the visual of it, just important that you see this.

patrick kingsley

And the shaft was several yards deep. It had the remains of a metal staircase descending into it. We could see electrical cables descending into the shaft. We couldn’t see where the shaft was leading to, but the military said this is the start of the Hamas underground complex that is underneath the hospital.

patrick kingsley But what does it — what does it tell us that there’s a spiral staircase going down into the ground? It’s interesting, but it doesn’t prove anything, doesn’t prove that there is a command center — speaker 4 What would you say it is? patrick kingsley I would say it’s a spiral staircase leading into the ground. speaker 4 Where to? patrick kingsley I don’t know, and neither do you. speaker 4 To the middle of the Earth.

patrick kingsley

For them, this was proof-positive that something untoward was going on within the grounds of Shifa. It was proof-positive that there was a military command center. And it became a subject of dispute, because we, journalists, can’t just take people’s word for it. We have to see for our own eyes what the shaft is leading to.

patrick kingsley It could be anywhere. It could be a path to anywhere.

patrick kingsley

We have to see that it leads to a tunnel that then leads to a command center that has weapons in it and so on. And what we were seeing was simply not that. It was something that seemed odd. Why would there be a shaft with a staircase leading down into the ground on the grounds of a hospital? But without further information, without further images, without being able to go down to the bottom of the shaft and proceed further, we could not conclude more than that.

patrick kingsley So is the idea that you can’t go further down that spiral staircase because there might be explosives? speaker 3 It could be booby-trapped. It could be explosives. It just takes time. We’ll do it, though. We’ll get them.

patrick kingsley

And the military, the senior officers told us, well, that was impossible for now.

speaker 3 It took us a long time to find this, and now, we’re being pressed for the last 36 hours why we didn’t come with a big victory picture and show the command center. This is going to take time.

patrick kingsley

And they are very frustrated with the outside world, that the outside world cannot see this for what they believe it to be. But for now, we felt that this was only a shaft.

sabrina tavernise

A shaft that is maybe suspicious but inconclusive.

patrick kingsley

I think that’s the right summary. The shaft is odd. It’s intriguing. We can imagine what it might lead to, but it stops short, so far, of being conclusive evidence of anything.

patrick kingsley But so we can’t go into the hospital? speaker 3 No.

patrick kingsley

And so we push them for other evidence. We push them to take us into other places in the hospital complex.

speaker 3 There’s still a threat from there. We can’t go into the hospital.

patrick kingsley

They said they couldn’t do that for now, for a bunch of reasons, including that they fear that Hamas fighters were still in parts of the hospital that they did not fully control and that some gunmen from within parts of the hospital fired on them when they first entered Al-Shifa hospital compound. And for them, this, again, was more proof of what they’ve been saying all along — that Hamas fights from within the hospital, that it’s not Israel that’s to blame for attacking a hospital, a place that’s supposed to be off-limits during a war, but it’s Hamas and its allies, who have broken international law by entering it in the first place.

speaker 3 This is additional equipment that we found.

patrick kingsley

We also asked if we could see some of the weapons and IEDs and so on that they said that they’d collected.

speaker 3 You see here a drone. You see Kalatch. You see a laptop, RPG.

patrick kingsley

They showed us to a shelf, where some of them were. Naturally, anyone can put a bunch of weapons on a shelf, and so this in itself is not proof. Even if they really were taken from other locations in the hospital, it’s not something that we as an international newspaper can accept as proof.

sabrina tavernise

Right.

patrick kingsley

And —

speaker 5 I told you that nothing will be good enough for you. speaker 6 If I have to go through a tunnel, you see a tunnel, it’s underground. What else do you need?

patrick kingsley

This caused a back-and-forth, because they were desperately hoping that this would be enough to convince international reporters, but inevitably, it wasn’t.

patrick kingsley Can we meet Dr. Abu Samir? speaker 5 You cannot.

sabrina tavernise

And while you were at Shifa, did you see patients? Did you see doctors, or even the civilians who were taking shelter there?

patrick kingsley

We saw none.

patrick kingsley Why not? speaker 5 Because we can’t go near the hospital.

patrick kingsley

We asked to visit them, and we were told it was too dangerous to enter that section of the hospital.

speaker 5 We gave some fuel. You can see — you’ll see lights are still on. They still have — patrick kingsley So they’ve taken the fuel. speaker 5 I don’t know.

patrick kingsley

But the soldiers pointed to how there were some lights on in the hospital and that the situation there remained tenable. But we knew from other reporting that there was a desperate situation inside. Hundreds, if not thousands, of displaced people who’d fled to the hospital for their safety, hundreds of wounded and injured people, some of them on life support machines, and more than 30 premature babies who were at risk of dying.

sabrina tavernise

But you didn’t see any of that.

patrick kingsley

No.

speaker 6 Back to the brigade headquarters. patrick kingsley Oh, we’re leaving? speaker 6 Yes.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so at the end of your time at the hospital, it seems like what you’ve learned is that the Israeli military thinks they have some evidence of a command center, but it’s this shaft, which is kind of unclear what it is or where it goes. They’re asserting that Hamas has been shooting at them from within the Shifa complex. That suggests that they are, to some extent, operating in the civilian place, though you don’t see evidence of that either. Like, basically, some evidence of some things, but nothing all that conclusive about any part of it.

patrick kingsley

Exactly, not yet. And when we got back into the armored personnel carrier —

elad tzuri Can you sit across from me? patrick kingsley Sure.

patrick kingsley

— and rumbled back through the southern neighborhoods of Gaza City, all these questions that had been in my mind at the start of the journey remained there — the question of whether there was conclusive proof that Hamas had been using this hospital as a military command center. And as we stood amid such a disfigured and damaged landscape, why and whether such disfigurement, such damage, was necessary and justified. And that question led to a wider discussion with the commanding officer of the brigade that has captured that part of Gaza.

patrick kingsley So I’ve come to Gaza many times. elad tzuri Yeah. patrick kingsley And this would be the area where I would go for my morning run every day. I’d go up the beach, I’d see the cafes and people swimming. Now, it is — I can’t even recognize it.

patrick kingsley

And when I asked the commanding officer of the brigade, Colonel Elad Tzuri this —

patrick kingsley Can you explain and justify the scale of the destruction? These cafes are gone. The beachfront resorts have gone. The lifeguard towers have gone. The apartment blocks are all shot out. Why was that so necessary? Was every apartment full of terrorists? Was every building — elad tzuri Every junction here was full with enemy that fired on us. So I’m sure it’s a beautiful place. I am sure it could be a beautiful place. But they are firing on us, so we have no other option. We are in a war. This is a war zone. And it’s full with enemy ammunitions, IEDs, RPGs. Everywhere — mortars that they are firing from this neighborhood to Israel — mortars. I know it’s beautiful place. I know. Could be. But they are firing from here to Tel Aviv. Did you also see this when you run here?

He responded in a way that suggested my question came from a place of luxury, of privilege, and of moral luck. His point was fundamentally that the Israeli soldiers that he commanded had had no choice but to fire back at the places where the Hamas fighters were, and by extension, destroy or damage the buildings in which Hamas was hiding.

patrick kingsley I think we can all understand that the need to take out rocket launchers and places where there are Hamas members firing at Israel, but is every part of this area? I mean, it’s basically all gone. Is — did all of it have to be taken out? elad tzuri Every place that fires on Israeli soldiers need to be taken out, yes. We are in a war, sir. It is what it is. patrick kingsley How much — elad tzuri And they could live here. The people, Gaza’s people, not Hamas. Gaza’s civilians. Beautiful life. But it was not what they choose.

patrick kingsley

And this was a microcosm of his wider point, which was that while, to me, this looked like a deathscape, a hellscape, ruin upon ruin, that that, fundamentally, was something that Hamas had brought on itself.

sabrina tavernise

This is fundamentally the Israeli case.

patrick kingsley

Yes. And it’s a refrain that you hear in Israel over and over.

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. So Patrick, we were just talking about your visit inside Shifa hospital. And in that visit, you saw suggestive but not conclusive evidence of Israel’s claim that there’s a Hamas command center under it. What has happened since your visit?

patrick kingsley

Since my visit, they’ve released more evidence. They have shown two more videos of the shaft that we visited. But this time, they’ve shown us what the shaft leads to. And the shaft seems to lead to a tunnel, a tunnel that extends perhaps dozens of meters underneath the ground until it reaches a metal door. And that’s when the videos that they have released stop.

sabrina tavernise

And has “The Times” independently confirmed that this is, in fact, from Shifa, this video?

patrick kingsley

Yes, we’ve confirmed both. Our video investigation team has confirmed that this video is from Shifa. And we can see from the images ourselves, me and my colleagues who were down there on Friday morning, that this was the same shaft that we looked at. And that’s not the only bit of evidence the Israeli army has produced since we’ve visited. They’ve also released closed-circuit television footage that shows people dragging in someone under duress into the entrance of one of the buildings of the Shifa hospital. And it also shows them wheeling someone who looks badly injured through on a gurney, through the corridors of Shifa hospital. The Israeli army says that these people were people that were kidnapped on October 7 and that this is more evidence that Hamas used the Shifa hospital as some kind of military command center. And “The Times” has also verified the location. What we haven’t done is confirm the exact timings of those videos, although the videos themselves do have the date of October 7 in the top left-hand corner.

sabrina tavernise

So bringing the hostages into the hospital could actually mean that Hamas is using it as some kind of base of some sort.

patrick kingsley

Exactly. There’s a counterargument that says that just because they brought in injured people into the hospital, that doesn’t mean that the hospital is being used as some kind of military nerve center. Those people perhaps were injured and needed to be treated. The counterargument to that is that at least one of those people does not seem to be badly injured. And secondly, there is more than one hospital in Gaza. In fact, there’s scores of hospitals, and if Hamas or their allies were really concerned about rushing people to have medical treatment, they could have gone to any number of other medical centers and hospitals that are closer to Israel than Shifa.

sabrina tavernise

Patrick, to the question that we started this conversation with, the question of whether there is proof of the Israeli claim that there is a command center under the hospital, there is more evidence, but it does still seem to stop short of conclusive proof, right?

patrick kingsley

That’s right. Lots of intriguing evidence is coming out, but from a journalistic point of view, if this was a “New York Times” investigation, our editors would say to us, go back and gather more evidence. This is not a conclusive slam dunk that you’re saying that it is. And indeed, that is what our editors are saying right now. We’re still saying that this stops short, so far, of conclusive proof of a military command center underneath the hospital.

sabrina tavernise

But is a tunnel with a big metal door that goes down deep into the Earth not pretty damning of Hamas, though? I mean, why would there be a tunnel under a hospital at all?

patrick kingsley

That’s a very good question and one that we’re all asking. And there don’t seem to be that many innocent explanations for why that would be. All that said, this still falls short of conclusive proof, and we need to wait days, possibly weeks, for further evidence to be presented.

sabrina tavernise

So in a world where this is the extent of the evidence of the claim that Hamas is underground there at the hospital, what does it mean about the broader underlying justification for hitting a lot of the civilian places that have been hit? If this is it, if this is all we’re ever going to see in terms of evidence, what does it mean?

patrick kingsley

I think it means that in the outside world, the battle lines that have already been drawn between Israel and its supporters and the Palestinians and their supporters will not really shift. And it’s going to remain a subject of debate. And more broadly, it means that the debate over whether Israel has been indiscriminately targeting civilian infrastructure or whether Hamas has been betting itself within civilian institutions is not really going to be shifted. Because both sides are going to dig in and say that they have enough evidence to prove their point.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so let’s consider the reverse. In a world where we do eventually see conclusive proof of a command center underneath Shifa hospital, what will it mean specifically about how Israel thinks about the total death toll?

patrick kingsley

Israel will say that it buttresses their argument that they are not totally to blame for such a high civilian death toll. They will say that, look, Hamas was embedded within Gaza’s largest hospital. Is it any surprise that when we had to take action, following Hamas’s raid on Israel on October 7, our response had a civilian toll?

sabrina tavernise

But do you think it still begs the question about Israel’s calculus when it comes to civilian deaths? And of course, the reason I ask you this is that Israel’s stated goal — and really, the goal in any military conflict — is supposed to be to target militants, right? Enemies, not civilians. But if the ratio is far, far more civilians are dying versus Hamas militants, that’s pretty meaningful.

patrick kingsley

I think this question boils down to, how many civilian deaths is too many civilian deaths? And there are many people who look at what’s going on in Gaza and say that even one civilian death is too many. But to others, including many in Israel, the question really is about whether Israel is taking precautions to minimize the loss of civilian life when attempting the very difficult task of targeting militants who have based themselves in civilian areas? And that debate becomes even more complicated, because we don’t know how many militants, Hamas fighters, fighters from other Palestinian armed groups, have actually been killed. There are some suggestions that it could be as many as 5,000, some suggestions it is much lower. They haven’t said on the record how many fighters they’ve killed. We understand they are keeping track. They haven’t said exactly what proportion of civilian death to military death is acceptable. And without doing that, they opened the door for accusations that they are not taking enough care to prevent the loss of civilian life.

sabrina tavernise

Patrick, it feels like from everything you’re saying about the Israeli strategy and from what the IDF soldiers told you when you were there in Gaza with them, that the Israeli belief really is that Hamas is hiding, literally, anywhere and everywhere, and so that everything is a potential target. But because the stated goal of Israel is to eliminate Hamas, it seems like the only logical outcome of that is basically the total destruction of Gaza. And of course, even more civilians dying in the process.

patrick kingsley

Yes. And that’s why when I went in on early on Friday morning, we saw such devastation — village after village of collapsed buildings, rubble, roads completely churned up, apartment blocks largely destroyed. It looked like a hellscape and largely unlivable.

sabrina tavernise

So Patrick, are you getting any indication that any of this — the large numbers of deaths, the destruction that you yourself witnessed in Gaza — is making the Israelis at all queasy or uncomfortable with their overall strategy of targeting Hamas within civilian areas? I mean, is there any indication that they’re considering whether there might be a different way to do all of this? Some other way where the toll on civilians is less severe? Are there other tactics being contemplated?

patrick kingsley

I think they’re not just being contemplated, but we are seeing those actions, to some extent, being carried out on the ground, not in a way that feels meaningful to many of Israel’s critics, but nevertheless, they are taking place. And an example of that is the operation to capture Shifa hospital. Following a lot of American pressure, Israel decided to send in only a small force to capture certain parts of it and to search certain parts of it, rather than sending in overwhelming force that might have created a bloodbath. And while this is small consolation to many Palestinians and, indeed, the people who were inside the hospital, who have not had anything like proper treatment in the last few weeks, this was, in Israel’s eyes, and indeed, I think, in the eyes of some of its allies, as an example of Israel trying to temper what it was doing.

sabrina tavernise

Interesting. What about the question of hostages? Does all of this strategy to destroy Hamas and its military capability jeopardize that other major goal — getting those 240-some-odd hostages back? How does that factor into the strategy at this point?

patrick kingsley

On the one hand, the further that Israel pushes inside Gaza, the greater the chance of street fighting and even subterranean fighting between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters becomes. And as that likelihood rises, so, too, does the likelihood that hostages might be killed in the crossfire. And that’s why there are protesters — not huge numbers of protesters, but there are protesters inside Israel who want a ceasefire in order to save the lives of hostages. The flip side, though, is that the further Israel goes inside Gaza, the more intelligence it’s able to pick up about the location of the hostages, the likelier it is that it might be able to rescue some of those hostages, and thirdly, the likelier it is that Hamas might feel more pressured to release some hostages in order to secure a ceasefire that would buy Hamas some time to regroup, to rebuild its remaining infrastructure, to get fuel in, to get food in, both for civilian population, but also probably for its own purposes. And what we have now are negotiations conducted through mediators between Israel and Hamas about the release of some of those hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners inside Israeli jails. Those negotiations, we understand, are closer and closer to reaching some kind of conclusion. But it could be days, if not another week, before those negotiations actually do bear fruit.

sabrina tavernise

What’s your best guess about where the Israeli strategy goes? What’s going to happen?

patrick kingsley

I think it’s likely we’re going to have a ceasefire at some point in the next week that would allow for some hostages to be exchanged for some Palestinian prisoners inside Israeli jails. But even if that doesn’t happen, again, it seems likely that Israel is going to head south. That’s where Israel believes that the Hamas leadership, including Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas in Gaza, is hiding. There’s also some talk that that’s actually where most of the hostages are. And that is going to compound a devastating humanitarian crisis in the south.

sabrina tavernise

Right, because most of the people from the north had fled to the south, right? So the south is now housing the majority of the Gazan population.

patrick kingsley

Exactly. The population of southern Gaza has probably doubled. We’ve got around two million people in this relatively small pocket of land. There are reports of diseases spreading. People are scavenging for food and water every day, because there’s such a shortage. It’s a really desperate situation as it is. And with an invading army heading into that mess, it is expected to get a whole lot worse. What we could see to mitigate that, albeit only in relative terms, is for another transfer of the population back up to the north. Whereto is really unclear, because as I saw, large parts of northern Gaza are decimated. And it’s not entirely clear where people would go if they went back north to where they’ve been living.

sabrina tavernise

The question is, come back to what?

patrick kingsley

In many cases, they will be coming back to ruins.

sabrina tavernise

Patrick, thank you.

patrick kingsley

Thank you, Sabrina.

239,239,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-evacuation.html,"Tens of thousands of desperate civilians, some waving white flags, have fled the northern Gaza Strip this week, marching along a road pocked with airstrike craters and lined with ruined buildings, as Israeli officials reported that their troops had pushed into the heart of the densely populated Hamas stronghold of Gaza City.

The United Nations estimated that through Tuesday, 40,000 people had walked out of northern Gaza along the only route south, after Israeli officials told residents of the besieged enclave to evacuate “for their own safety,” and thousands more streamed out on Wednesday.

The evacuations have accelerated in part because of the sharply deteriorating humanitarian situation in northern Gaza, with food and clean water now nearly nonexistent. Israeli forces have also intensified their ground assault in the north, “tightening the noose around Gaza City” and carrying out coordinated attacks deep inside the city, Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said in televised remarks on Tuesday night.

As the ground invasion has expanded, the Israeli military said it was offering a daily window of time in which it would guarantee safe passage for civilians.

News photographs as well as a video released by the Israeli military on Wednesday, the fifth day the evacuation corridor was open, showed men, women and children trudging past half-destroyed buildings. Some rode on donkey carts but most were walking, down Salah Al-Din Road, named for the 12th century Muslim sultan and conqueror — known in the West as Saladin — who captured Jerusalem from the Crusaders. They carried small bags, but no suitcases."
240,240,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/opinion/gaza-children-food-malnutrition.html,"It is hard to describe what it means for someone to be “severely wasted,” but when you hold a child who is suffering from this most lethal form of acute malnutrition, you understand, and you never forget. In Afghanistan last year, I met a 3-month-old girl named Wahida who was so malnourished I could barely feel the weight of her in my arms. Her suffering has left an indelible mark on my heart.

Now the suffering in Gaza is leaving a similar mark on me. Last week, I visited the al-Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Inside, I was met with a sea of patients, health care workers and the displaced. And there were children everywhere: girls and boys running through the corridors, resting on mattresses with their families and recovering in hospital beds. I met a 16-year-old being treated for injuries sustained when her neighborhood was bombed. Though she survived, the doctors say she will never be able to walk again.

The medical staffers were mounting truly heroic efforts to provide lifesaving care to their patients, including dozens of children. But with their supplies of fuel, medicines and water nearly depleted, it is unclear how long they can continue to provide even the most basic of interventions. In the hospital’s neonatal ward, for example, tiny babies were clinging to life in incubators, as doctors worried about how they could keep the machines running without fuel.

These children, Gaza’s youngest — as well as those in utero — are especially vulnerable to the burgeoning crisis of malnutrition and the prospect of starvation. After more than six weeks of war amid bombs and gunfire, a lack of electricity and the near-total closure of all border crossings, Gaza’s one million children are now food insecure, facing what could soon become a public health catastrophe.

Supplies of nutritious food have virtually run out. Shops are closed, and in the streets of Khan Younis I saw piles of garbage where there once were food stands. Last week, the al-Salam Mill in Deir al-Balah was reportedly hit in an attack and forced to shut down. This was Gaza’s last functional flour mill. All local flour production is now effectively halted.

The hostage release deal outlined on Tuesday would include a cease-fire of at least four days and would reportedly allow for some new shipments of basic humanitarian aid to go to the people of Gaza who desperately need it. But to save lives and ensure that Gaza’s people, especially its children, remain healthy and stave off looming health issues, we as humanitarian partners must be permitted to bring quality food, essential nutrition supplies, water and fuel into Gaza, at levels that are sufficient to meet the surging needs. And we must be permitted to continue safely delivering these resources after hostilities resume."
241,241,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/world/middleeast/us-strike-iraq-iran.html,"The United States conducted a new round of airstrikes — the second in roughly a day — in Iraq early Wednesday, destroying two facilities used by Iranian proxies that had been targeting American and coalition troops, U.S. military officials said.

The latest rounds in the tit-for-tat attacks between the United States and Iranian-backed fighters took place in Iraq, in a departure from the United States’ practice of striking mostly targets in Syria.

This time, the United States struck an operations center and a command-and-control node south of Baghdad used by Kataib Hezbollah, a militia group in Iraq that is considered a proxy of Iran. Kataib Hezbollah’s political wing is part of the coalition of Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani of Iraq.

A defense official said the military could not provide a casualty assessment.

The strikes came as the Biden administration has escalated its attacks recently. Barely more than 24 hours earlier, an American military gunship fired on and killed three Iran-backed militants on Monday night who the Pentagon said Tuesday were part of an attack on U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq. Unlike that exchange, which Pentagon officials said came at the spur of the moment after an American warplane in the area witnessed the ballistic missile attack on Al Asad Air Base and retaliated, the Wednesday morning strikes were planned, at least for a few hours.

In the earlier attack, a Pentagon spokeswoman said, the militants had moved to their vehicle after firing missiles at Al Asad Air Base, one of the last remaining Iraqi bases where U.S. forces are stationed. The gunship, an AC-130, spotted them from the air, she said.

“The militants were targeted because the AC-130 was able to determine the point of origin,” the spokeswoman, Sabrina Singh, said on Tuesday. “We had an aircraft that was able to identify where the close-range ballistic missile was being shot from, and therefore we were able to take action.”

The U.S. strikes followed others last week in eastern Syria against facilities used by Iran and its proxies. Officials said the American strikes last week killed at least six people and possibly seven. The Biden administration had previously conducted airstrikes that officials said were meant to deter Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the militias it supports in Syria and Iraq, but U.S. officials had said that before last week, they had caused no known casualties.

The administration blames Iran and the militias aligned with it, known as the Axis of Resistance, for what has become a daily barrage of rocket and drone attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria.

The latest strike came almost two weeks after American warplanes hit a munitions warehouse in eastern Syria and then several buildings in the region that the Pentagon said were being used for training, logistics and storing munitions, as well as a safe house serving as a command headquarters. An earlier set of U.S. retaliatory strikes came on Oct. 27.

Until last week, President Biden had rejected more aggressive bombing options proposed by the Pentagon out of fear of provoking a wider conflict with Iran. But the U.S. strike on Monday was the second to cause fatalities. American officials say there have been 66 strikes by Iran-backed militias on American troops and bases since Oct. 17."

We could use some prayers right now, in a country inflamed with hate and prejudice and generational mistrust. Americans are at each other’s throats, living in different realities, fraught by two brutal, calamitous wars. So, as this annus horribilis lurches to a close, with the hope that we can understand each other better, or at least eat pie together, here is the annual holiday column from a man I frequently disagree with, but always love, my conservative brother, Kevin.

Less than a year before the country chooses a president, President Biden’s poll numbers are almost catastrophic. The overwhelming majority of voters say he is too old, and Donald Trump is beating him in five of six battleground states, according to one recent survey.

While majorities of the country find both Trump and Biden unacceptable, Trump remains the Republican front-runner, bolstered by what his supporters see as overeager Democratic prosecutions. This scenario holds great peril for Republicans because Trump is the weakest candidate against Biden. He already lost to him in 2020 and the reflexive hatred he generates, especially among women, could boost Democratic turnout as only Trump could manage.

Biden’s three years have been a disaster. An exorbitant round of unnecessary Covid spending sent inflation through the roof, leading to a destructive rise in interest rates and further squeezing consumers."
244,244,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/20/magazine/israel-gaza-oslo-accords.html,"The state of Israel was born in war. The year before its founding in 1948, the United Nations produced a partition plan that proposed to divide the stretch of land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea into two states, Arab and Jewish. The surrounding Arab countries rejected the plan, as did Palestinians living on the land. And on May 15, a day after Israel declared itself a state, four Arab countries attacked. Jewish Israelis saw the ensuing war, which they won, as an existential fight for survival, one that came just a few years after the Holocaust. To Palestinians, 1948 marked the Nakba, or catastrophe, in which 700,000 people fled or were forcibly expelled from their homes. Many went to the West Bank, where Jordan took control, or the Gaza Strip, which Egypt occupied.

Chronic conflict followed. So too did periodic efforts to resolve it. None brought lasting peace. Negotiations between Israel and Palestinians barely existed for decades, and subsequent military conflicts made the situation more difficult. When Egypt mobilized troops on the border in 1967, Israel launched pre-emptive airstrikes, and in a war fought in six days against a coalition of Arab states, Israel took over contested territory, beginning a military occupation in the West Bank and Gaza. Many Palestinians, living under occupation or as refugees around the world, still saw the founding of Israel as an act of dispossession that had robbed them of their land and homes. In 1968, when Yasir Arafat became chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the group’s charter called the establishment of Israel illegal and sanctioned armed resistance in what it saw as a struggle for liberation. Some P.L.O. factions conducted bombings, hijackings and other attacks, including the killing of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. As a result, Israel refused to negotiate with the P.L.O., considering it a terrorist group.

A political shift began in the late 1980s. With Arafat and other P.L.O. leaders in exile in Tunisia, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza mounted a locally led popular uprising in December 1987. Television footage of the First Intifada (which means “shaking off” in Arabic) showed Israeli soldiers beating children throwing stones, eroding Israel’s international standing.

Over the following years, with Israel and the P.L.O. under pressure for different reasons, momentum built for the two sides to negotiate a resolution. An opportunity for something unprecedented began to take shape: the first direct dialogue between Israel and the P.L.O. and what would become their most sustained effort to reach a settlement. This was known as the Oslo peace process, named for the city where the secret talks took place. It ran through most of the 1990s and came as close as any negotiated process ever has to resolving this intractable conflict. In the end, Oslo failed. The reasons for that failure — and the lessons it has to teach us — have been debated ever since.

We assembled a panel of scholars and experts — three Palestinian, three Israeli and an American — to help us understand the history of Oslo: Was it a genuine chance for peace? Was it doomed from the start? Why did it unravel?

This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity, with some material reordered and added from follow-up interviews.

Part 1: The Road to Oslo

Abbas/Magnum Photos The First Intifada, December 1987. Micha Bar-Am/Magnum Photos Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel during the the Middle East peace conference in Madrid, 1991. Jerome Delay/Associated Press Photo

In the 1990s, the international order in the Middle East realigned as a result of the gulf war. When Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait, most Arab countries joined the U.S.-led coalition to push them out. The P.L.O., however, backed Hussein. The decision cost the P.L.O. the financial and diplomatic backing of many of its Arab allies.

President George H.W. Bush and his secretary of state, James A. Baker III, saw an opening for international intervention. In October 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union hosted the Madrid peace conference, with delegations from Israel, Lebanon and Syria, as well as a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. The gathering represented a breakthrough, but it did not include the P.L.O. Yitzhak Shamir, Israel’s prime minister, objected to the group’s presence, and Arab countries went along with his wishes.

These contradictions led Palestinians to seek a second track for talks and eventually to go to Oslo.

So the Palestinians were in the midst of a shift about how to approach their engagement with Israel.

Baker tried hard to pressure Shamir in the Madrid negotiations. He threatened to withhold $10 billion in loan guarantees unless Israel stopped building settlements in the territories, which became a big issue in Israel. And this helped enable Yitzhak Rabin to come to power in 1992.

For Rabin, who had the ethos of standing fast and not yielding, this was for him Israeli society going soft — not cowardice, but softness. He sensed that Israelis are sick and tired of wars.

Kurtzer: Let’s start with why Rabin was attracted to backchannel negotiations at all. That was not easy for him. There were no senior leaders in Israel until that time — other than Shimon Peres, the foreign minister — who were ready to negotiate with or recognize the P.L.O. as the representative of the Palestinian people. Rabin, as Mr. Security, was certainly not in favor of it.

Margalit: All the Israeli leaders who negotiated for peace, starting with Rabin, were in a weak political position. Rabin’s coalition had only a slim majority of 62 out of 120 seats in the Knesset, and it depended on a religious party. Some of its leaders were pretty dovish, but their voters were not, or that was the perception.

Inbar: Rabin was under political pressure to succeed. He was not a very successful prime minister in his previous stint in the 1970s. Also, he viewed the international circumstances as very beneficial for having such an agreement. America was the winner of the Cold War, and we were America’s ally. The P.L.O. was weak, because it had sided with Saddam Hussein, and Rabin preferred to deal with it when it was weak, not when it was strong.

Kurtzer: The negotiations in Washington that followed Madrid didn’t go anywhere. And Rabin was torn. In February 1993, when academics were talking to the P.L.O. and Oslo had begun, Rabin came to Washington on an official visit. He asked to meet with us, members of the U.S. peace team, but not the secretary of state, which was unusual. He conducted a soliloquy: The P.L.O. is out to destroy us, but on the other hand, only Arafat can make decisions. When he walked out after 45 minutes, we looked at each other and said, This man is ready to figure out how to talk to the P.L.O.

Part 2: The Oslo Agreement

Gary Hershon/Reuters, via Redux

The two sides agreed not to discuss the past. They exchanged draft proposals. The negotiating teams grew to include other P.L.O. officials and representatives of Israel’s Labor Party government. Abu Alaa stressed economic cooperation and the progression from easier issues to harder ones, to build trust. Rabin and Arafat, whom the negotiators called the grandfathers, began monitoring the talks closely.

The two sides agreed to a “declaration of principles,” known as the Oslo Accord, which set the terms for further peace negotiations, with the promise of a permanent resolution within five years — more than anyone had achieved before. In the unprecedented agreement, Arafat, on behalf of the Palestinian people, recognized Israel’s right to live in peace and security and agreed to renounce the use of terrorism or any other form of violence. Rabin recognized the P.L.O. as the official representative of the Palestinian people. The accord also included promises of Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and part of the West Bank, of elections for Palestinian self-governance and of a permanent resolution, based on the principle of land for peace in U.N. Resolution 242.

On Sept. 13, 1993, Rabin and Arafat met for the first time for the signing of the Oslo Accord on the White House lawn. With a nudge from a beaming President Bill Clinton, they shook hands. “We the soldiers who have returned from the battle stained with blood,” Rabin, a former general, said in a speech, “we who have fought against you, the Palestinians, we say to you today in a loud and clear voice: ‘Enough of blood and tears! Enough!’” Arafat spoke in a similar register: “Our two peoples are awaiting today this historic hope, and they want to give peace a real chance.”

Bazelon: In that famous moment on the White House lawn, what hopes did people have? What seemed possible?

Dajani: With the First Intifada, and then subsequently Madrid and Oslo, Palestinians suddenly see the possibility of agency. There is this idea that Palestinians would not allow themselves to be marginalized from the process of deciding the fate of their homeland.

There is a feeling during this juncture that independence is just around the bend. Palestinians having made this historic compromise in 1988, with the Declaration of Independence, and effectively having said, All right, we agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state, alongside Israel, which means 78 percent of what Palestinians regarded as historic Palestine would not be part of that state. Having made that compromise, Palestinians, to a great extent, had the sense that independence and the end of occupation were imminent, that these processes in which they were participating directly were going to yield a completely new reality.

But at the same time Ashrawi says they all knew the P.L.O. was in a weakened position. For her and others, supporting Oslo was the price to pay for moving the peace process forward and for giving the P.L.O. a new lease on life.

Kurtzer: The Oslo agreement was full of holes. The mutual recognition was asymmetrical, and that was to hurt the Palestinian negotiating position for years to come.

Before, the conflict was always described as Arab-Israeli, and people in Israel would say, Well, they have 22 Arab countries. But now we are recognizing a unique Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

All the time, comparisons are made to the peace process with Egypt or Jordan or even Syria. However, those are disputes over borders involving Israel and another state. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, on the other hand, is of a different nature. It revolves around conflicting demands for self-determination, which both sides perceive as a zero-sum game, evoking feelings of existential threat and profound insecurity.

Yehuda: Yes. Until the 1990s, we had freedom of movement. When I was young, Palestinians were traveling or working or driving with their cars inside Israel, and Israelis were going to Gaza and to the West Bank.

Bazelon: Efraim, were you hopeful about the Oslo Accord at the outset?

Inbar: We hoped the deal was simple. This was the deal between Rabin and Arafat, and nobody should tell you anything else: You get land. We didn’t expect peace. We wanted you to keep away the terrorists from us. Just like with Egypt, with Jordan, we hoped that the embryonic Palestinian state will be able to have a monopoly over the use of force. And then there would be no terrorism.

By the way, there is a wider problem in the region of establishing states that have a monopoly on the use of force. Look at Sudan, at Libya, at Yemen, Iraq and Syria. You don’t have to accept my analysis. But what’s important to understand is that the notion of peace for Rabin, and for most Israelis, is that peace is a lack of violence from the other side. Leave us alone. We don’t want violence.

Part 3: Threats to Oslo

Violence and extremism quickly threatened the Oslo Accord. Only five months after the signing at the White House, in February 1994, an American-born settler, Baruch Goldstein, opened fire on Palestinians who were praying during Ramadan at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the West Bank city Hebron, killing 29 people and wounding about 125 more. The Jewish supremacism to which Goldstein ascribed called for dominion over all of the land of Judea and Samaria, the biblical term for the West Bank, and treated any withdrawal as anathema.

Bazelon: What effect did the Hebron massacre have?

Shikaki: That was a turning point, as far as the Palestinian public was concerned. The reaction of the Israeli government to the Palestinians showed that the political leadership in Israel, including Rabin, was too weak to take any significant measures to deal with the settlers, to evacuate settlers, for example.

Dajani: In the moment following the massacre, the Israeli government could have said, We are going to signal to the settler movement that we are shifting away from the dangerous messianic nationalism Baruch Goldstein represented. Imagine the gesture it would have represented to Palestinians if Israel had removed the Jewish settlement in the heart of Hebron first, knowing that it would never be feasible to have a two-state solution with that remaining. How much more difficult would it have been for Hamas to justify the attacks it commenced in the months that followed?

Barring Israel taking that path, the United States could have said, To ensure Oslo realizes its potential, we will have a third-party force on the ground in Hebron to stabilize things and ensure protection of civilians. That was similarly a missed opportunity.

Instead, a completely toothless observer mission was created, which had no role other than to literally watch what was happening and write it down.

Shikaki: The violence immediately brought about a significant rise in support for Hamas that was temporary but sufficient to give Hamas the strength it needed to be able to carry out large-scale violence to destroy whatever was being achieved.

Yehuda: Matti Steinberg, a former top adviser to the Shin Bet security service, told Rabin in March 1994 that he’d better move straight to the talks on a permanent resolution.

Inbar: What is most important, and people do not realize it, is that all Rabin’s intelligence officers, including the chief of intelligence, told him in not so many words, The Palestinians are preparing for war.

Rabin was Mr. Security, and he was really authoritative, and probably only Rabin could have convinced the Israelis to take the risk needed to make a deal with the Palestinians.

Inbar: But building settlements isn’t a violation of the accords. Maybe you mean a violation of the American or Palestinian understanding. But in the agreement, there is nothing written against expanding settlements.

Dajani: I think that Palestinians thought oblique statements in the Oslo Accord about preserving the status and integrity of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip would be enough to mean that no settlements would be built during the interim period, especially based upon assurances they felt that they had received orally by Israeli leaders in the negotiations — the sorts of things that as a contracts professor, I might have cautioned against.

Margalit: The underlying understanding of the Oslo agreement was that Rabin was committed to go on. That he was the most trusted person among the people who supported Oslo and that he would be there carrying on the future stages of the agreement. And then his assassination obliterated this.

Shikaki: For Palestinians, the decline of support and optimism for the Oslo process was certainly consolidated in 1996 by the election of Netanyahu. Economic conditions in the West Bank and Gaza somewhat improved. Gross national product rose, with laborers working in Israel and businesses opening in Palestinian areas. But it was not enough to increase per-capita income, so it didn’t really have significant benefits for normal people. Most of the economic benefits went to Israelis, and people could see that.

Bazelon: Netanyahu governed from the right but continued with the Oslo framework. In 1998, he and Arafat signed another agreement, with Clinton as mediator, which provided for further Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and for Palestinians to take specific steps to prevent terrorist attacks. But terrorism continued, and Israel postponed most of the withdrawal. In the end, the two sides breached the agreements signed in the 1990s. What effect did that have?

El Kurd: I think it exacerbated the dynamic that Dr. Shikaki mentioned. It seemed to the Palestinians, by 1996 especially, that the Oslo peace process was an attempt to reorder the status quo, to give Palestinians something less than a state and to avoid backlash.

I also think it’s important to note that the Oslo Accord not only inserted the P.L.O. leadership into the West Bank and Gaza from the outside but also hollowed out the civil society and grass-roots organizations, like women’s groups and agricultural groups, which engaged in the First Intifada. Western donors wound up undermining the Palestinian women’s movement by misunderstanding it and not recognizing how much women were adversely affected by the ongoing military occupation, as the political scientist Manal Jamal has described.

Dajani: Despite the serious design flaws in Oslo, I don’t think today’s reality was an inevitable consequence. I think the U.S. could have played a useful role in compensating for the accords’ weaknesses.

One of the biggest problems was that there was no mechanism for third-party dispute resolution. Palestinians thought that the international community, and the United States in particular, would step in to ensure that the obligations of Israel were being implemented in good faith. And again and again, what the United States chose to do instead was to leave Israeli leaders with discretion, by blocking efforts in the U.N. Security Council to censure Israel for continuing settlement activity.

Kurtzer: I thought we would bend toward Israel on security and bend toward Palestinians on territory and governance. In other words, to assure Palestinians a serious state while finding ways to address Israel’s legitimate security concerns when they would have to give up those territories. But the U.S. negotiators didn’t do that.

In practical terms, you can see it in a book written by Dennis Ross, who was Clinton’s chief negotiator, where he admits that the negotiating methodology that he and his colleagues pursued was to work out agreements with Israel and then to try to market them to the Palestinians. So you had something that was later called America acting as Israel’s lawyer. And as Omar suggested, there were no monitoring mechanisms to hold anyone accountable.

Yehuda: Oslo was supposed to build trust. It did the opposite.

Part 4: Camp David Summit

In May 1999, with post-Oslo negotiations stalled, Israeli voters once again elected a would-be peacemaker. Ehud Barak, Rabin’s heir as leader of the Labor Party, defeated Netanyahu, whose coalition split over implementing his agreement to withdraw more troops from the West Bank.

Like Rabin, Barak didn’t have a strong coalition — the peace camp in the Knesset held only 36 of 120 seats. Barak decided that in contrast to the incremental process of Oslo, he would make an all-out push for a final peace agreement. He pressed for a speedy round of negotiations followed by a one-time summit with Clinton as host.

Bazelon: How did the prospects look for Camp David?

Dajani: I arrived in Israel-Palestine in the fall of 1999. It was my first time to visit the place, and I was there as a legal adviser as part of the team that was assembled to support the Palestinian negotiating team in the peace talks. And I think that the Israeli electoral politics are worth noting for just a second. We were coming out of several years of a Netanyahu-led government in Israel and the sense of deep immobility with regard to the things Palestinians expected the peace process to deliver. And I remember very vividly how optimistic we were about Barak taking the helm.

In November and December of 1999, we begin the discussions. Ehud Barak starts off by saying that U.N. Resolution 242 — land for peace, at the 1967 lines — doesn’t apply to the West Bank. And so suddenly, what we heard was, Oh, wait a minute, a main basis for negotiations is inapplicable. And as the negotiations proceeded in the first half of 2000, those anxieties deepened. I remember, just to cite one example, entering into a round of negotiations in spring 2000, and it was the first point at which the Israeli delegation presented a map of what a territorial settlement might look like. It was quite extraordinary: 30 percent of the West Bank was under continuing Israeli control, and all of the settlements in that map were under Israeli control, even the settlement inside Hebron.

What we were expecting was that almost all of the West Bank would be transferred to Palestinian sovereignty. What we were seeing instead was a fairly limited contiguity between Palestinian areas. And the American team is doing very little to place any kinds of guardrails around this process.

So I think it is true that once we began discussions in earnest, it was possible for us to start to make progress. But I would just say, Emily, that Barak’s approach seemed to be to decide what was good for them and for us, and to lay it out as kind of a proposition to be accepted or refused rather than one to be negotiated. During the Camp David talks, it was very difficult for us to recognize what seemed to be a bargaining maneuver versus what seem to be Israel’s positions, in part because he was so forcefully arguing that his coalition agreement and Israeli politics more broadly were constraining his ability to maneuver.

Bazelon: The offers at Camp David were not written down, and there are competing interpretations of what happened. Dennis Ross, the lead U.S. negotiator, said on NPR recently, about Camp David: “We moved the Israelis a lot. But Arafat — even though I would talk to him and he would say his negotiators were authorized to negotiate, they didn’t actually do so.” According to Ross, Arafat said no to the offers on the table.

Kurtzer: Look, Camp David was what we call in American football a poorly prepared Hail Mary. Nobody was ready. The American team had to call for reinforcements to discuss Jerusalem and refugees because there had not really been serious discussions on that previously. Arafat didn’t want to go to Camp David. I was ambassador to Egypt at the time, and I had to go see Hosni Mubarak to pressure Arafat. Arafat only went because Mubarak pressed him to go. And then the United States ended up blaming Arafat for the failure of Camp David.

Margalit: Actually, the Israelis were well prepared for the negotiations but ill prepared to deal with Jerusalem. There are two things that the Israelis realized are important to the Palestinian, to Arafat’s, narrative. The return of the refugees and the Temple Mount.

It became clear that Arafat could give up on the refugees’ return if he gets sovereignty over the Temple Mount. And it was clear that the Israelis won’t take refugees into Israel, apart from a symbolic number, because of the demographic fear of losing the Jewish majority. Maybe it can work, but maybe you have hostility between the two communities and end up in a civil war, like in Lebanon.

Shikaki: To a large extent, Arafat knew that the deal on refugees was not doable. There was no way he would get any actual return, and he made peace with that. However, he needed to be able to legitimize the package by having sovereignty over Haram al-Sharif. And I think that is what Arafat wanted.

Unfortunately, Camp David was proposed as a one-shot deal, make it or break it. And that was the huge mistake. Had this been one of various meetings and discussions, things would have been easier.

So overall, I think for Arafat, a deal without sovereignty over holy places would be a deal that he cannot sell. In his mind, being able to go to Haram al-Sharif and have a photo while praying, this was the most important legitimating piece of diplomacy that he needed to sell a peace deal to the Palestinians.

Kurtzer: Barak’s proposal was more than the Palestinians had ever seen before, but it fell far short of their absolute minimum. They believed when they accepted a two-state solution in 1988, that they already had given up 78 percent of Palestine. To be asked in Camp David to give up more, and not to be given what they needed on Jerusalem or minimally on refugees — all these issues boiling after Oslo came to a head at Camp David.

The biggest single issue was Arafat’s failure to put forward an alternative. Israelis came to negotiate. Arafat never really entered into negotiations.

Shikaki: The Americans didn’t really have a vision of their own to present to the parties as they sat down at the table.

Inbar: From an Israeli perspective, Barak made incredible concessions at Camp David. Particularly, he violated the taboo on dividing Jerusalem, which in the Israeli psyche is really important.

And generally the expectation of the Palestinians that they will get 100 percent of their demands — and I understand that they feel that they just get less than 22 percent of the territory — is something that is not realistic. The Israelis saw it as another sign that they will get from Palestinians a two-stage strategy: First they get one part of the territory, and then there will be more struggle.

El Kurd: What comes up for me is that the Palestinian public can be forced to disregard their national aspirations. From my understanding, at Camp David, there’s not enough information for the Palestinian negotiating team. There is no movement on the right of return, as has been mentioned. There’s not enough movement on Jerusalem. So why would the Palestinian negotiating team agree with any of this? At the end of the day, it seems like the peace process was predicated on the idea that something could be forced on the Palestinian people.

Bazelon: Despite the violence that fall, the U.S. team worked on what became the Clinton parameters, presented to the parties in late December 2000. They provided for Palestine sovereignty over 94 to 96 percent of the West Bank and a land swap of up to 3 percent more. Palestinian refugees would have the right to return to the West Bank and Gaza, and some might be absorbed into Israel, at Israel’s discretion. In Jerusalem, Palestinians would have sovereignty over the Arab neighborhoods and over the Temple Mount. According to Robert Malley from the U.S. negotiating team and Hussein Agha, the Palestinian adviser, “The president’s proposal showed that the distance traveled since Camp David was indeed considerable, and almost all in the Palestinians’ direction.”

Barak largely accepted the parameters, but Arafat did not, and the clock ran out on Clinton’s presidency. Why did this proposal fail as well?

Now the Americans are coming up with ideas, and the Palestinian side is not in a mood to trust the administration or show the kind of willingness Barak was going to show. So the Palestinians delayed their response, and then they told Clinton they had several reservations.

The violence of the Second Intifada and onward isn’t only because of the triggers like Sharon visiting the Al Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount. It’s also because of the foundational deprivation of freedom and equality. We destine ourselves to be in a constant state of conflict. There was a period during Oslo when I think a bigger part of our population did understand. But then out of a mix of reasons that included legitimate fear about security, we didn’t take it seriously enough.

When Oslo began, and the Israeli and Palestinian teams decided not to talk about the past, they imagined setting aside their competing narratives — especially the origin stories of 1948 — to focus on practical questions about the present, about how to live alongside one another. Perhaps setting aside the past is impossible, however, when one people’s realization of its aspirations, and its sense of survival, mean the other people’s loss of roots and place.

Bazelon: Does finding a way forward begin with reckoning with the past?

Shikaki: There is really no way in which one can end the conflict if one is not to resolve ’48. In theory, one can reach a peace agreement without addressing ’48, and I think that some Palestinians might have agreed to that — that is, leaving the issues of ’48 for a later stage, including the right of return — if doing so is not the end to the conflict, and the parties can raise further claims in the future. But I think there might be greater resistance to that from the Israelis. And therefore, I do think that ’48 must be part and parcel if our goal is to permanently end the conflict.

Kurtzer: I am mindful as a former diplomat to avoid blunt language. But if Palestinians expect that anybody will accept reverting to 1948, they’re going to be sorely disappointed. And if Israelis believe that they can achieve an agreement on something less than 1967, they’re going to be sorely disappointed.

The only outcome that may work, but I don’t see it happening in the immediate future, is ’67. Meaning a Palestinian state that effectively covers 100 percent of 22 percent of Palestine, with some land swaps. East Jerusalem is going to be in that package. A creative solution to the Old City will be in that package. The United States is not under any foreseeable presidency going to deliver anything else.

Shikaki: I think the most important failure of the past has been the fact that the process was always open-ended, without a two-state solution as the goal. And that is certainly something that any new negotiations must not repeat.

Yehuda: Yes, we need a long transition, but there needs to be an end game. It’s not easy to build a functioning state. The transition period needs to be focused on building a viable, sustainable, successful Palestinian state. It also must be focused on security for Israelis. That has always been necessary, but now, after Oct. 7, it is even more so.

Bazelon: The Hamas attacks on Oct. 7 have made peace seem more elusive than ever. Hamas invaded Israel to commit terrible violence and provoked a war in which Israel is inflicting mass civilian casualties in Gaza. Though I know it feels remote now, out of war can come peace. This happened in the 1970s between Israel and Egypt, and later Jordan, and it has happened with some of the world’s other most intractable conflicts, like Ireland and Bosnia. Could it happen again?

Margalit: Remembering Rabin’s worry when some Israelis evacuated from Tel Aviv in 1991 because of the Iraqi Scuds, I think it’s crucial to understand what is abetting the Gaza war now, from the Israeli point of view, namely evacuating and destroying a whole suite of land, within southern Israel, with towns and kibbutzim, and also people leaving the north because of airstrikes from Hezbollah in Lebanon. The evacuation of all these people is a crucial moment in Israeli history. Making a deserted strip of land in the north and south is in a way dismembering or dismantling not just the territorial integrity of Israel but really the whole Labor Zionist vision. Because this is all within the green line.

Under what conditions will people be willing to go back to these places? That will be the endpoint of the war, I think.

I’ve thought that only a catastrophe can bring about a solution. I think this moment has the potential to be this kind of catastrophe. Not only because of the momentous events both in Gaza and in Israel but also because it’s the first time, in this war, that Israel depends on a United States military presence in the Mediterranean Sea in a big way to deter Hezbollah and Iran. This is a real change, a dramatic change in terms of the dependence of Israel on the United States. It’s time for the United States to pursue a version of what Dan said, which to me is sheer common sense.

Inbar: I was lecturing on the conflict in Athens at a think tank, and somebody told me: Listen, you fight for so long. Enough is enough. So I asked him, How many years did you fight the Turks? And I believe his answer was about 250 years. And I thought, you know, if this is the frame of reference, then we have a young conflict.

It’s an ethno-national conflict, and we see that both sides have tremendous energy. Both sides are ready to fight to spill their own blood. It’s very important to get tired. Without getting tired of the conflict, we’ll continue to fight each other. And I do not believe an imposed solution will be useful.

On how the Hamas attack of Oct. 7 and the war in Gaza will influence the conflict, I disagree with Avishai and Limor. Because for Israel, this is a war to restore deterrence. Israel has to show deterrence in order to survive in the Middle East. In the Middle East if you are not strong, you invite aggression. I think this is true of how Middle Easterners, in various capitals, view interstate relations in this region.

El Kurd: For any kind of future agreement, if there is to be one, there has to be clarity that the Palestinian public does not just want self-governance. Palestinians want self-determination, and they want sovereignty.

Dajani: I think that really did disappear from view during Oslo. And at this juncture we are talking about parity. There are roughly seven million Palestinians and seven million Jews living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. And so what we have to figure out is how we live together in this space. There’s really not an alternative.

At present, the frame for how we live together is that some five million people in that space just don’t have political rights and also have deeply constrained civil rights and very limited access to social and economic rights, including health. That is an unsustainable frame.

I realize from Oslo and Camp David how incredibly difficult it is for international actors to intervene constructively to design a mission that could work, but in view of how far apart these parties are, I can’t imagine how we make any progress without such a step.

Margalit: There is a sense that if you think that you have a solution, it means that you don’t understand the problem and you are naïve.

But then there is the biblical question: Shall the sword devour forever? And I think that the answer should be no. I don’t think that we must wait for 250 years.

245,245,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/opinion/adl-elon-musk-antisemitism.html,"Last week a self-described Jewish conservative named Charles Weber took to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, to address the “cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting ‘Hitler was right.’” Weber dared those trolls to “say it to our faces.” One X user took him up on it.

“Okay,” the user replied. Jewish communities “have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.” Echoing the great replacement conspiracy theory, which holds that Jews are scheming to undermine white political power by importing Black and brown immigrants, he accused Jews of flooding America with “hordes of minorities.” Therefore, he said, he was “deeply disinterested” in Jewish panic about mounting antisemitism.

Then Elon Musk, the owner of X and one of the richest men in the world, chimed in, responding: “You have said the actual truth.”

Musk’s words caused a firestorm and led to a major advertising exodus from X, but they shouldn’t have been that surprising, because he has been flirting with antisemitism for a while now. He’s compared the liberal Jewish billionaire George Soros to the X-Men supervillain Magneto — a Jew who grew to hate humanity during the Holocaust — and later accused Soros’s organization of seeking “nothing less than the destruction of western civilization.” Musk has tweeted an alt-right Pepe the Frog meme and welcomed the rapper Kanye West back to Twitter after West, who now goes by Ye, threatened to go “death con 3 on Jewish people.” For the last few months, he has been on a crusade against the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization that he blamed for a 60 percent decline in Twitter’s ad revenue. Last week, an investigation by the progressive watchdog group Media Matters for America found that X was placing ads for major corporations next to white nationalist and neo-Nazi content. (On Monday, X filed a lawsuit against Media Matters, accusing it of manipulating the platform’s algorithm “to force a situation in which a brand ad post appeared adjacent to fringe content.”)

So I wasn’t shocked by Musk’s words. I was astonished, however, by how easily, in the days following his antisemitic outburst, Musk was able to win praise from a few Jewish leaders simply by promising to censor common pro-Palestinian language. The sordid episode was a reminder of the moral rot that comes from conflating the state of Israel with the Jewish people, a rot we see on both sides of the ferocious fight over Israel’s future.

Since Oct. 7, Jews the world over have been confronted by vicious antisemitism unleashed by hatred of Israel. I’ve long argued that anti-Zionism and antisemitism aren’t the same thing; the leftists who want to see a binational state in Israel and Palestine with equal rights for all may be naïve, but they are not genocidal. However, the explosion of anti-Jewish rhetoric and violence occasioned by the war in Gaza — the stabbing of a Jewish woman in France, the shootings of Jewish day schools in Montreal, the killing of a Jewish protester near Los Angeles — has forced me to reckon with how often anti-Zionism and antisemitism are intertwined. Abhorrence of the Jewish state slips easily into abhorrence of Jews.

On the right, though, there’s a mirror image of this slippage, with some defenders of the Jewish state willing to make excuses for antisemites so long as they champion Israel. The apocalyptic Christian Zionist pastor John Hagee, for example, has said that Adolf Hitler was sent by God to drive the Jews to Israel, “the only home God ever intended for the Jews to have,” and claimed that the Antichrist would be “partially Jewish, as was Adolf Hitler, as was Karl Marx.” (He later apologized for his insensitivity even as he said, “I cannot deny the tenets of my faith.”) Despite his inflammatory words about Jews, Hagee was invited to speak at the March for Israel in Washington last week. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has regularly embraced nationalist leaders who deploy antisemitic tropes, Donald Trump chief among them.

Musk appears to have learned the lesson that ardent Zionism can function as an alibi for antisemitism. As advertisers fled X last week, he suddenly announced that he was going to ban the pro-Palestinian slogan “From the river to the sea,” as well as “decolonization,” a buzzword on the anti-Zionist left. The move made a mockery of the ostensible free speech absolutism that was Musk’s excuse for allowing so much antisemitism on X in the first place. It did nothing to curb overt white nationalists on the site, many of whom had celebrated Musk’s “actual truth” post. But it was enough to earn him plaudits from some Jewish and Israeli spokespeople. “This is an important and welcome move by @elonmusk,” tweeted the ADL president, Jonathan Greenblatt. “I appreciate this leadership in fighting hate.” (An ADL spokesman told me that Greenblatt’s praise was “narrowly focused on a specific policy decision” and that the group hasn’t rescinded its other criticisms of Musk.) Amichai Chikli, Israel’s minister for diaspora affairs, thanked Musk for “standing on the right side of history.”

X’s erratic owner was able to win this approval without even apologizing for boosting the very antisemitic conspiracy theory behind the 2018 shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. It’s hard to figure out who is behaving more cynically, Musk or the Jewish leaders who are koshering him."
246,246,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/05/us/politics/israel-us-weapons-west-bank.html,"An Israeli government request for 24,000 assault rifles from the United States is drawing scrutiny from American lawmakers and some State Department officials who fear the weapons might end up in the hands of settlers and civilian militias trying to force Palestinians from land in the West Bank, where violence has been surging, U.S. officials say.

The three proposed tranches of semiautomatic and automatic rifles are valued at $34 million and are being ordered directly from American gunmakers, but they require State Department approval and congressional notification. Israel says the rifles would be used by the national police force, but has also indicated that they could be given to civilians, people familiar with the weapons orders told The New York Times.

The State Department gave informal notification of the sale last week to congressional committees, which ignited concerns and prompted requests for the department to ask Israel tougher questions about how it intends to use the arms. Within the department, officials working on human rights issues have expressed reservations, while those overseeing weapons sales intend to approve the orders and announce them in the coming days, U.S. officials say.

The Israeli police are seeking to bolster their weapons arsenal after officials pledged to supply thousands of weapons to Israeli civilians in at least 1,000 towns and cities, including Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. About 500,000 Israelis have moved to settlements there over many years, which, along with military checkpoints, fences and other measures of the Israeli government occupation, keep the area’s 2.7 million Palestinians living in separate small enclaves.

Although much of the global criticism of Israel’s recent actions has centered on its airstrikes in the Gaza Strip, which health ministry officials there say have killed nearly 10,000 people, President Biden and his top aides are increasingly worried about rising violence in the West Bank.

Even before the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks set off the current war in Gaza, violence by Israeli settlers in the West Bank who aim to force Palestinians from strategic tracts of land had risen well above the level of recent years.

U.S. officials attributed that to the encouragement of settlers by the far-right government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and statements by some Israeli officials supporting the annexation of the West Bank. Since Oct. 7, more than 150 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank — nearly equal to the number in all of 2022, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.

Most of the killings have taken place during encounters with the Israeli military, but some have been at the hands of gun-bearing civilians. Mr. Biden said on Oct. 25 that violence by “extremist settlers” was “pouring gasoline on fire.” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken raised concerns with Israeli leaders during his trip to Tel Aviv on Friday and spoke about the problem with Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian Authority, in a meeting in Ramallah on Sunday.

The two discussed “efforts to restore calm and stability in the West Bank, including the need to stop extremist violence against Palestinians and hold those accountable responsible,” the State Department said in a statement.

Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Blinken have stressed in recent days that a Palestinian state existing alongside Israel is the best long-term solution to the decades-old conflict. Settler intimidation of Palestinians, leading to their displacement from strategic areas of the West Bank, makes any prospect of that much more difficult.

State Department officials who oversee weapons sales have discussed potential concerns with Israeli counterparts. “We received assurances from the Israelis that these will only go to I.N.P.-controlled units,” Jessica Lewis, the assistant secretary in the political-military affairs bureau, said in a statement to The Times, referring to the Israeli National Police."
247,247,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/us/arkansas-thrall-bds-antisemitism.html,"A few weeks ago, Nathan Thrall, a Jewish American writer whose work strongly supports Palestinian rights, was invited to speak to students at the University of Arkansas about a new book.

But there was one catch: To be paid for his visit, Mr. Thrall was told that he had to pledge, according to a 2017 state law, that he would not boycott Israel. He declined.

When news broke that Mr. Thrall would not sign the pledge, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders applauded the university.

“On campuses across America, pro-Hamas protesters are harassing Jews, praising terrorism, and calling for the destruction of Israel,” Ms. Sanders, a Republican, wrote on social media. “That is unacceptable and won’t happen in Arkansas.”

At college campuses around the country, students and faculty have been engulfed in vitriolic debates over students’ pro-Palestinian speech. There have been loud dueling protests and angry donors registering their displeasure on social media. Brandeis, Columbia and George Washington University have banned or suspended pro-Palestinian student protest groups.

At a large public university in a more conservative state like Arkansas, the debate is playing out in a somewhat different way. Well before the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, state lawmakers had tried to control the debate on the Middle East, for instance demanding in the 2017 law that anyone contracting with the state sign a pledge against boycotting Israel."
248,248,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/us/politics/gaza-hostages-israel-hamas.html,"“We share the frustration. We understand the pain,” said Jason Straziuso, a spokesman for the Red Cross. “We’re not bulletproof, and it’s not possible for us to walk into a conflict zone in hostile territory without permission — to walk up to a group of people, most certainly holding guns that they will use, and demand that they let us inside. It’s not possible.”

The Red Cross has about 130 employees in Gaza, he said, giving it some ability to deliver humanitarian aid and to visit the scenes of destruction from the war. But even with that access, meeting with the hostages requires an agreement with Hamas.

Mr. Straziuso said Red Cross officials were talking to Hamas, Israel, the United States and other nations about the condition of the hostages.

But those talks have been shrouded in secrecy.

In a statement on Monday, the Red Cross said the group is “insisting that our teams be allowed to visit the hostages to check on their welfare,” but added that “the I.C.R.C. does not take part in negotiations leading to the release of hostages. As a neutral humanitarian intermediary, we remain ready to facilitate any future release that the parties to the conflict agree to.”

Separate discussions about a possible release of some hostages are being conducted through intermediaries, with Israel and the United States communicating with Hamas only by way of messages passed back and forth by negotiators in Egypt and Qatar.

A leader of Hamas said in October that not all of the Israeli hostages who were taken to Gaza were being held by the group, a claim that most likely complicates negotiations for their release. Osama Hamdan, a member of Hamas’s political bureau in Lebanon, said other groups, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a separate organization that is an ally of Hamas, were also holding some of the hostages.

In late October, Israeli forces rescued one hostage, and four others were released by Hamas about a week earlier. But there have been no further breakthroughs.

Warring nations have blocked the Red Cross from visiting hostages or prisoners of war in previous conflicts. In 2022, eight months into the war between Ukraine and Russia, the Red Cross still had little access to prisoners held by either side. In a statement at the time, the group wrote that “blaming the I.C.R.C. for being denied full and immediate access does not help prisoners of war or their families.”

But the fact that there is no definitive playbook in the case of hostages during wartime, no exact timing for reporting about whether they are dead or alive leaves the family members with little to hold on to as the days slowly pass.

Liz Hirsh Naftali, the great-aunt of Abigail Idan, recounted on NBC News how the 3-year-old Abigail watched on Oct. 7 as Hamas fighters shot and killed her mother and ran with her father and two siblings.

“Abigail was in her father’s arms,” Ms. Naftali said on “NBC Nightly News” with Lester Holt. “And as they ran, a terrorist shot him and killed him, and he fell onto Abigail.”

She added, “We learned that Abigail actually had crawled out from under her father’s body and, full of his blood, went to a neighbor, and they took her in.”

Hamas later seized the neighbor, her three children and Abigail, Ms. Naftali said.

Rachel Goldberg, who is married to Mr. Polin, and other family members have said they have no idea when — or whether — they will discover anything definitive about their loved ones. Ms. Goldberg detailed the grief of a mother who has no idea if her son is alive “or if you died yesterday, or if you died five minutes ago.”

(In 2004, before moving to Israel, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg’s son, Hersh, attended the same preschool as my children in Richmond, Va.)

Inside Israel, where the faces of the hostages are plastered everywhere on posters that proclaim them “KIDNAPPED,” activists have mounted an aggressive campaign to demand swifter action from the Red Cross."
249,249,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/world/yemen-houthi-ship-hijacked.html,"Yemen’s Houthi militia released a video on Monday showing its forces hijacking the ship Galaxy Leader, a day after announcing it had seized the vessel in the Red Sea as a demonstration of support for “the oppressed Palestinian people.”

The video, whose authenticity was verified by The New York Times, shows at least 10 armed men on the deck of the roughly 600-foot-long vessel after jumping out of a military helicopter hovering just above it.

Most of the video appears to come from cameras attached to men’s heads, and follows them as they seize control of the bridge from crew members. A later section of the video, taken from a distance, shows a handful of small boats — of a type known to be used by Houthi rebels — moving around and alongside the ship. One flies a Yemeni flag used by the Houthis as well as a Palestinian flag; the same flags are by this point flying on the Galaxy Leader."
250,250,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/world/middleeast/indonesian-hospital-premature-babies.html,"Another hospital in the Gaza Strip came under fire on Monday, as the World Health Organization warned that the enclave’s devastated health system had largely collapsed, with none of its functioning hospitals capable of handling complicated medical cases.

At least 12 people were killed and dozens of others were wounded in the latest attack, on the Indonesian Hospital in the far northern city of Beit Lahia, according to two hospital staff members and the Gazan health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

It came less than a week after Israeli forces raided Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa in Gaza City, about five miles to the west, in an effort to capture and expose what it says were extensive Hamas operations within and beneath the hospital, including underground bunkers, a command center and a network of tunnels. Hamas and hospital administrators deny that the militant group used the grounds of Al-Shifa or other hospitals for military operations.

The source of the strike on the Indonesian Hospital could not be independently verified, as heavy fighting raged around it. The Gazan health ministry blamed Israeli forces for the attack.

The Israeli military said in a statement that its troops had come under fire overnight “from within” the hospital. It said it had “directly targeted the specific source of enemy fire,” but that “no shells were fired toward the hospital.” The statement did not elaborate on the seeming contradiction."

252,252,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/opinion/israel-free-speech-hamas-palestine.html,"On Oct. 25, Professor Nurit Peled-Elhanan, a lecturer at a college in Jerusalem, participated in a discussion in a faculty WhatsApp group about the horrific events of Oct. 7. In response to another lecturer’s message, she wrote that “the massacre,” referring to the actions of Hamas, reminded her of something the French philosopher and playwright Jean-Paul Sartre once wrote about race relations, adding a paraphrased quote: “‘After so many years that the neck of the occupied has been suffocating under your iron foot and suddenly was given a chance to raise his eyes, what kind of gaze did you expect you would see there?’ We saw this gaze,” Ms. Peled-Elhanan wrote to her colleagues.

A few hours later, Ms. Peled-Elhanan — a winner of the European Parliament’s Sakharov Prize for human rights and the freedom of thought and a bereaved mother whose 13-year-old daughter, Smadar, was murdered in a 1997 terrorist attack by Hamas — received a letter from the president of the college. He advised her that she was suspended and summoned her to a hearing on whether her employment would be terminated. The charge: “displays of understanding to the horrific act of Hamas” and expressing “justification to the heinous act.”

The case of Ms. Peled-Elhanan, who approached me for legal advice after getting this notice, is not an isolated one. In the past three weeks, according to Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, dozens of students, almost all of them Palestinian citizens of Israel, have been suspended or summoned to hearings before being suspended from their academic institutions on the charge that statements they posted on social networks constitute support for terrorism. The group Academia for Equality has identified at least three other university lecturers at different institutions, one Jewish and two Palestinian, who were also summoned to hearings. One was fired, and two are still in proceedings. (Ms. Peled-Elhanan was eventually given a severe reprimand but was able to keep her job.)

The active suppression of speech carried out by more than two dozen Israeli academic institutions is very likely a direct result of their yielding to the pressure mounted by extreme right-wing groups that scan social networks and act as serial complainants — and apparently from a directive from the Minister of Education sent on Oct. 12 to institutions demanding that they immediately suspend any student or employee who expresses him- or herself in a manner that constitutes “support for terrorism” or “support for the enemy.”

The crackdown is not only at institutions of higher learning. The Israel Police and the prosecutor’s office reported to the Knesset that as of Oct. 25, over 126 criminal investigations have been opened and 110 arrests have been made after individual statements made in public, on social media or in closed groups regarding the events of Oct. 7 and the ongoing war in Gaza. This intense scrutiny and policing is in part the work of a task force established a few months ago to monitor so-called Palestinian incitement to terrorism on the internet, led by Itamar Ben-Gvir, an extreme right-winger and former supporter of the outlawed racist Kach movement, who is now Israel’s minister of national security.

The Israeli police and the task force are assigned to monitor extremist speech, and it seems that they have been primarily engaged in spying on Palestinian citizens of Israel. As far as I can tell, not a single Jewish Israeli who has issued calls to “erase Gaza” or carry out a “second nakba,” meaning “catastrophe,” or other acts of terrorism against Palestinian civilians has been summoned by the police. In the weeks since the Oct. 7 attacks, Facebook and X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, have been filled with prominent public figures — politicians, retired generals, celebrities, media influencers and journalists — making such calls with impunity."
253,253,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/books/review/the-genius-of-israel-dan-senor-saul-singer.html,"In other words, the country may be facing a reckoning because of deep societal divisions and its precarious place in the Middle East, but paradoxically, Israel arrived here as one of the world’s most successful societies, with a thrumming energy. And that may prove its salvation.

I returned to Israel earlier this year for my fourth tour as a correspondent in 40 years, and I recognize much of what the authors describe. A country that was not long ago agrarian, struggling and under siege has become a beacon of high-tech growth and development. Fast trains are being built to link previously remote cities. Parts of the once quaint center of Tel Aviv now rival the Shanghai skyline.

Most Israelis feel a deep sense of belonging and attachment to one another. But the failure of the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to protect its citizens, and the angst that has pervaded every conversation for the past year, suggest that the future is far from assured.

Here it is worth pausing to note that, while Senor and Singer devote short sections to Israel’s two million Arab citizens and one million ultra-Orthodox Jews, they are focused on the country’s six million or so mainstream Jewish Israelis. They also ignore the circumstances of the Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation next door. Some would argue that this amounts to telling the story of the Titanic without mentioning icebergs.

Senor, an American writer, podcaster and investor who has guided Republican politicians such as Mitt Romney, and Singer, an American-born journalist who advised members of Congress before moving to Israel 30 years ago, talked to scores of Israelis, from entrepreneurs to politicians to religious leaders and TV writers. The book is an easy read and the narrative conceit — a quest to figure out Israeli exceptionalism — works pretty well. The data are so remarkable, after all, that they beg for explanation.

The search for answers brings them back partly to the military. Unlike Americans, Israeli youth learn early that they are part of something larger. The military offers an alternative to the academic meritocracy and values determination, teamwork and self-criticism. Focusing on those skills, the authors argue, helps build a superior and more creative work force.

Loneliness is increasingly seen as the bane of Western existence, but in Israel, as the TV executive Danna Stern tells her interlocutors, “We overshare. We go into details. There is no sense of privacy and there are no boundaries between work and home.” It is, she says, “a recipe for love and conflict.” The way in which the country came together to take on its military challenges in recent weeks is further evidence of this.

Indeed, the book argues, the ongoing external threat and the shared goal of building a secure Jewish state that defies not only the Nazi Holocaust but centuries of antisemitism create a sense of purpose. To know that your very existence is at stake focuses the mind. As Micah Goodman, a writer and thinker, tells the authors, there is a feeling in Israel that “history is happening” and that every citizen helps make it happen.

After its security crisis ends, Israel will return to the brewing battle over whether every citizen does in fact make it happen and how competing agendas clash in defining a state as both Jewish and democratic. It seems hard to gain a full picture of the country’s future without a deep look at the large marginalized groups the authors put to the side.

About a fifth of Israel’s citizens are not Jewish. About one in eight practices a Judaism so all-consuming that there is little room for secular studies or income-producing work. Some three million Palestinians live under occupation in the West Bank with little prospect of attaining full rights, and another two million are trapped in Gaza under Hamas. Can the country continue to turn away from these challenges and pay no price? As Oct. 7 and its tragic aftermath illustrate, the answer is no.

The authors did most of their work before this year’s fight over the independence of the judiciary. Running to catch up, Senor and Singer rewrote their opening note to reiterate the message of a later chapter on previous crises. In 1952, the Israeli government accepted about $800 million in reparations for the Holocaust from West Germany. Protesters who felt this money pardoned the Nazis marched up to the Knesset, threw stones and injured several legislators. In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon to pursue Palestinian militants who had attacked Israeli civilians, and allowed its Lebanese allies into Palestinian refugee camps, where they massacred at least 800 people. Over the ensuing months, hundreds of thousands of disgusted Israelis filled the streets; in response, a right-wing activist threw a grenade into a crowd, killing an Israeli military veteran who opposed his government’s actions.

Many such moments in Israel’s history have produced intense internal fighting and, the authors argue, the crisis this year over the nature of its democracy may prove no more dire. The Hamas slaughter followed by Israel’s unforgiving war in Gaza came after the book went to press. The regional picture has rarely been darker as Iranian-backed militias aim at Israel from several directions. This feels different. The optimism that propels “The Genius of Israel” seems, just now, like a distant memory.

THE GENIUS OF ISRAEL: The Surprising Resilience of a Divided Nation in a Turbulent World | By Dan Senor and Saul Singer | Avid Reader | 316 pp. | $30"
254,254,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/opinion/israel-west-bank-palestinians.html,"In the early 1980s our village, along with a group of others in an area called Masafer Yatta, was designated by the military as Firing Zone 918, land that Israel decided it wanted for training its forces (A government document indicates that there was an intention to displace residents living in the area.) We have been fighting for the right to remain on our land ever since. We live in Area C of the West Bank, which means the Israeli military has complete civil and security control over our lives. Israel has tried various tactics to get us to leave, including enacting policies that prevent us from building homes in our own village and not allowing us to be connected to the main electrical grid or water infrastructure.

Sometimes it’s been much less subtle: In November 1999, when I was a year old, the Israeli military loaded all of Tuba’s residents and livestock onto trucks and dumped us on the side of the road several miles away. We spent the following months crowded in makeshift tents, fighting to shelter ourselves and our livestock from the cold winter rain. We were eventually allowed to return to our village “temporarily,” pending a final court decision.

Settlers from the illegal outpost of Havat Ma’on — built near Tuba and partly on private Palestinian land not long after we returned — have done their share as well. In 2002 they cut off the main road that connected Tuba to the surrounding villages, including the children’s closest school and the city of Yatta, where we buy all of our food and medical supplies.

Settlers have also resorted to violence, some of it directed at my family. We believe it was nearby settlers who stabbed my uncle, attacked my cousins with stones and, as I’ve written before, set fire to a year’s worth of food for our flocks of sheep.

Throughout it all, we had been awaiting the final ruling from the Israeli high court about whether the Israeli military could force us to evacuate. Then, last year, the court ruled in favor of the state, allowing Israel to evict about 1,200 Palestinians, including those in my village. We have remained steadfast in the face of this pressure and refuse to abandon our land and our traditional way of life. But in recent weeks, attacks by settlers have rattled our resolve.

We have always felt that the work of the military, which demolishes our houses and prevents our ability to move freely, was intimately intertwined with and reinforced by harassment from settlers. However, since the war started more than a month ago, the settlers and soldiers in the region seemed to have fused into one entity, ending whatever semblance of distance existed between these two violent systems. Settlers whom we recognize from years of harassment in our villages have suddenly become soldiers, as reservists or as part of Itamar Ben-Gvir’s civilian security teams. Army reservists who are new to the area are apparently now taking their orders from local settler-soldiers or security teams. Together they patrol our communities with their M16s and threaten anyone who tries to bring his flock to graze or leave the village for work or errands.

In Tuba, as in nearby villages, settlers have also targeted the water systems and solar panels we have built and are entirely dependent on, as if to remind us of our vulnerability. They are clearly taking advantage of this moment to make our lives unlivable, and we have no reason to believe that, especially during a state of war, any of the violence we are experiencing in our communities will slow or stop soon. Local Israeli authorities say they are investigating some of the more violent attacks, including the killings, but they are showing no signs of being able to control them, and in fact, government ministers are fanning the flames.

In the last five weeks alone, residents from five other villages in the South Hebron Hills have been forced to pack up and flee from their homes. If the situation doesn’t change, I worry that Tuba will be next. As a letter signed by 30 nongovernmental Israeli human rights organizations recently stated, “The only way to stop this forcible transfer in the West Bank is a clear, strong and direct intervention by the international community.”

Since I can remember, life in Tuba has been difficult, but it has also always been full of beauty and calm. It is the life my family has known for generations, and the traditional lifestyle we live is deeply connected to the land around us and the animals we care for. The hillsides are stamped with our footsteps and those of our flocks, the rocks on the top of the hill neatly arranged so we can watch the sunset over the desert. But the fear we feel, in Tuba and across Area C, now hangs heavy over this landscape. I don’t know if we will be able to stand it."

The future of OpenAI is in jeopardy after more than 700 of its 770 employees signed a letter yesterday saying they may leave the company for Microsoft if the ousted chief executive, Sam Altman, is not reinstalled at the high-profile artificial intelligence start-up.

OpenAI’s four-person board shocked the tech industry Friday afternoon when it removed Altman, saying it could no longer trust him. The decision by the board set off a frantic weekend that ended with Altman joining Microsoft to start a new A.I. project with Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president and a company co-founder. Yesterday, OpenAI announced it was in talks to have Altman rejoin the company, only to say the same evening that he would not be returning.

The upheaval leaves the future of one of the fastest-growing companies in Silicon Valley history in doubt.

It was a win for Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion in OpenAI and will be able to continue using the start-up’s models to power its own products, while also giving a new, Altman-led team the money it needs to build new Microsoft-owned models."
256,256,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/world/middleeast/premature-babies-gaza-hospital-egypt.html,"Thirty-one premature babies had been evacuated from Al-Shifa to southern Gaza, the Red Crescent and the World Health Organization said. It was not immediately clear why three of them had not been taken to Egypt.

One mother, Ayat Al Daour, was reunited with her twin daughters, Mera and Dahab, at the Emirati Hospital on Monday, before they were transferred to Egypt. She said she gave birth at Al-Shifa five days into the fighting and was soon released — but without her daughters. She had not seen them for 39 days.

After being discharged, Ms. Al Daour said, she fled her home for a refugee camp in Gaza City, then heeded warnings about the danger there and headed south — all the while unable to communicate with medical workers at Al-Shifa. Hearing news reports that the babies had been moved to Emirati Hospital, she walked hours to the hospital and finally saw her girls alive and well, she said.

“When they were saying a premature baby died on the news, I could not know whether that was my baby or not,” she said.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which helped organize the evacuation, said on social media that five babies “had already died due to lack of electricity and fuel” at Al-Shifa. Israel imposed a siege on Gaza that has largely blocked supplies of fuel, food and water after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas that killed around 1,200 people in Israel.

The W.H.O., which is a United Nations agency, said in a statement on Sunday that 11 of the babies were in critical condition and that all were fighting serious infections.

UNICEF, which said it had participated in the “extremely dangerous” evacuation effort, said the conditions of the babies had been “rapidly deteriorating.” It added that the babies had been moved to Rafah in temperature-controlled incubators.

The Israeli military said in a statement it had helped to facilitate the evacuation from the pediatric ward and provided incubators to Al-Shifa. It was not clear whether those were the incubators used to transport the babies.

The W.H.O.’s director general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, posted a photograph on X of a staff member in a blue United Nations helmet and bulletproof vest scooping up a tiny infant. The babies, along with six health care workers and 10 family members of hospital employees, were evacuated “under extremely intense and high-risk security conditions,” he wrote.

The authorities in Israel have said it has evidence that Hamas had a headquarters underneath Al-Shifa, something Hamas as well as doctors there deny.

Israel’s push to seize Al-Shifa last week set off a struggle to survive there. Doctors and health officials warned that nearly 40 premature babies were at particular risk. Some had been born to mothers who had been killed in airstrikes or who died shortly after giving birth, doctors at Al-Shifa have said. Some were the only survivors in their families."
257,257,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/world/middleeast/palestinian-pregnant-women-childbirth-gaza.html,"“My experience during childbirth was a nightmare in every sense of the word, or something like a horror film,” said 29-year-old Wajiha al-Abyad.

Her contractions started at around 9 p.m. on Oct. 29. “We called for an ambulance, but they told us they couldn’t come. The streets were empty and pitch-black, and there was no sound to be heard except for the noise of planes and shelling.”

After about 40 minutes, an ambulance did turn up. It transported her at high speed through Deir Al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip. “Most of the streets were badly damaged. I was stuck inside contending with contractions and jolts as the ambulance raced through ruined roads.”

Women, children and newborns in Gaza are disproportionately bearing the burden of the war, both as casualties and in reduced access to health care services. The U.N. estimates there are around 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza, and that more than 160 babies are delivered every day.

In the space of a few weeks, Ms. al-Abyad’s life had been turned upside down. She fled her home in Gaza City with many of her relatives on Oct. 14, after the Israeli military ordered over a million people to leave northern Gaza. She dreaded the idea of giving birth in these circumstances. “The tension and anxiety I felt were more painful than the contractions,” she said.

Since the outbreak of the war, crossings into Gaza had been closed, making it impossible for her husband in the United Arab Emirates to be by her side. Instead, her mother joined her in the ambulance.

Together, they made it to Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat, around a 20-minute drive from their home. They found the hospital’s maternity ward was no longer functioning: It had been repurposed to treat the large numbers of war casualties.

“There was a lot of tension and screaming, and the doctors were under extreme pressure,” Ms. al-Abyad said. “Patients there were bleeding, and they didn’t know what to do for them.”

Less than an hour later, Ms. al-Abyad gave birth to a baby boy named Ahmed. “Every five minutes, there was shelling right outside the hospital, so close that mothers would hide their newborn babies under their clothes, afraid that the windows might shatter and the glass would fall onto them,” she said.

“All I could think about was how will I leave? How will I go back home?”"
258,258,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/opinion/isaac-herzog-nyt-guest-essay.html,"Our goal in Opinion is to publish a wide range of ideas, arguments and commentary that help readers see an issue or a debate in a new light, challenge their assumptions and grapple with the hardest problems societies face.

Nothing is harder right now for many readers — for many of us — than grappling with the horrific terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, the capture of hundreds of Israeli hostages by Hamas and the growing civilian casualties and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. My colleagues and I have published dozens of columns, guest essays, editorials, podcasts and video documentaries about the war.

Today we are adding to that coverage a guest essay by the president of Israel, Isaac Herzog — a piece that is clear about what the leadership of his nation sees as the stakes in the current conflict. At a time when this war risks spilling over into a wider regional crisis, we felt it an important statement for readers today and for the historical record.

Mr. Herzog has long been a force for moderation in Israeli politics, a former leader of the Labor Party and an advocate of a two-state solution peace process. In recent weeks, he has been meeting with relatives of those held hostage in Gaza, as well as survivors of Oct. 7 and family members of those killed. “Tragedy is part of Israeli life, and I knew it would be part of my time as president. But none of us imagined a tragedy like this,” he writes.

Mr. Herzog’s core idea is about the “moral confusion” he sees in the aftermath of Oct. 7. He sees a struggle not just between Israel and Hamas but between people who see terrorist acts in conflict with humanity and people who try to justify terrorist acts. His argument about moral confusion centers on people in the Middle East, in America and elsewhere who rationalize or even support the Hamas attack on Israel. “It would have been unthinkable to hear such moral confusion uttered after the Sept. 11 attacks or after bombings in London, Barcelona and Baghdad,” he writes.

Some readers will surely agree with Mr. Herzog’s essay, and some will no doubt disagree. This is not unusual in Times Opinion: I don’t always agree with every sentence we publish, but I’m committed to our process of rigorous editing, fact-checking and publishing a multiplicity of views.

That’s what we’ve done since the terrorist attack, bringing perspectives from across Israel, Gaza and the rest of the Middle East. In addition to Mr. Herzog’s essay, we published this morning a human rights lawyer on his Palestinian client’s search for justice in the Israeli court system, an episode of “The Ezra Klein Show” about polling on the frustration civilians in Gaza feel toward Hamas’s leadership, American students arguing that colleges need to do more to protect Jewish students and a short film documenting Palestinian children in 2021 talking about their hopes and dreams for the future.

Independent opinion journalism is strongest when we publish a range of opinions and voices that help us see a more expansive view of the world and to hear from those close to difficult realities — even when that world breaks our heart.

259,259,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/19/world/middleeast/israel-yemen-houthis-hijacked-red-sea-ship.html,"Yemen’s Houthi militia hijacked a ship in the Red Sea on Sunday, in what the Iran-backed group said was a demonstration of support for “the oppressed Palestinian people.”

Only hours earlier, the group threatened to target Israeli-flagged, -owned and -operated ships traversing the Red Sea.

The Israeli military called the episode on Sunday a “grave event,” saying that the ship was en route to India from Turkey and had an “international crew, without Israelis.”

“This is not an Israeli ship,” the military said in a statement.

The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said in a statement that the vessel was British-owned and operated by a Japanese company. It had 25 crew members on board, the statement said, condemning the attack without naming the vessel.

The Houthis, however, said they had hijacked an “Israeli ship” and taken it to the Yemeni coast. They said they would deal with its crew members “in accordance with the teachings and values of our Islamic religion.”

News reports identified the ship as the Galaxy Leader, which bore no obvious links to Israel. The ship sailed under the flag of the Bahamas — a popular place for ship registration because of tax advantages — and is listed as a vehicle carrier owned by an Isle of Man-based firm called Ray Car Carriers Ltd., according to Marine Traffic, a real-time maritime data platform.

The company’s beneficial owner appears to have at some point been the Israeli billionaire Rami Ungar, according to the Paradise Papers, a major leak of confidential documents that in 2017 exposed a hidden world of wealth and ownerships. Mr. Ungar — who is routinely cited as the ultimate owner of Ray Car Carriers in maritime trade media — did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The 620-foot Galaxy Leader departed from Turkey’s port of Korfez on Nov. 12 and was headed to India’s Pipavav, according to Marine Traffic. It last transmitted its location on Saturday morning from the middle of the Red Sea, off the coasts of Saudi Arabia and Sudan.

Support for the Palestinian cause and hostility toward Israel has long been a pillar of the Houthi narrative; “Death to Israel” is part of the group’s rallying cry. Since the Israeli military began its bombardment of Gaza — responding to the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, the Iran-backed armed group that controls Gaza — Houthi leaders have issued repeated threats to enter the fray. Last month, the Houthis claimed an attempted missile and drone attack on southern Israel, and said the group might attack Israeli ships in the Red Sea.

The Houthis took over the Yemeni capital, Sana, in 2014. After an unsuccessful attempt by a Saudi-led military coalition to rout the group, it now rules much of northern Yemen. The militia has also become an important arm of Iran’s so-called Axis of Resistance, which includes the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and armed groups in Iraq.

In their statement on Sunday, the Houthis vowed to continue carrying out military operations against Israel “until the aggression on Gaza stops.”

Nearly four days after the Israeli military stormed the biggest hospital in the Gaza Strip, the World Health Organization described the complex as a “death zone” where several patients had died because medical services had been shut down.

There were 291 patients remaining at Al-Shifa Hospital, the U.N. agency said in a statement late Saturday after Israeli forces allowed a U.N. team to tour the facility for an hour. Israel has yet to provide conclusive proof of a subterranean military base at the hospital.

Yesterday, 31 premature babies in extremely critical condition were taken to Al-Helal Emirati Maternity Hospital in Rafah, in the enclave’s south, the Palestine Red Crescent Society and the W.H.O. said on social media.

Palestinian officials had said on Saturday that many people were killed and injured in an Israeli attack on the Al-Fakhura school, which was being used as a shelter by adults and children, in the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza.

Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees, gave a death toll on Sunday and said that there were nearly 7,000 displaced people sheltering in the school when the strike hit. He did not give a number for the wounded or suggest who was responsible.

The Israeli military said that it had received reports of an incident on Saturday in the Jabaliya area and that it was under review, adding that it was “committed to international law including taking feasible steps to minimize harm to civilians.”

Mr. Lazzarini said that another school, where some 4,000 displaced people were sheltering at the time, in Gaza City, was “directly struck” on Friday, and ambulances “could not reach the school to provide help.” His agency, UNRWA, said it believed that scores of people had been either killed or wounded, but did not have exact numbers.

The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians have sought shelters at U.N. facilities throughout Gaza. “I reaffirm that our premises are inviolable,” he said in a statement on Sunday.

At least 176 displaced people sheltering at schools run by UNRWA have been reported killed and nearly 800 wounded since the start of Israel’s bombing campaign against Gaza on Oct. 7, according to the UNRWA statement. Classes have been suspended and the schools have been converted into shelters across Gaza.

The agency said that it was still verifying its figures for the numbers of dead and wounded, but that it had confirmed that at least 17 of its facilities have been directly hit.

The “large number of UNRWA facilities hit and the number of civilians killed cannot just be ‘collateral damage’,” Mr. Lazzarini said in the statement. The agency’s facilities were clearly marked as U.N. buildings and their coordinates were regularly shared with both sides of the conflict, he said, adding that “This is yet another proof that no one, and nowhere is safe in Gaza.”

The Al-Fakhura school was also hit by a strike on Nov. 4, killing at least 12 people and wounding 54 others, UNRWA said.

According to UNRWA, almost 900,000 displaced people are sheltering in the agency’s facilities across the Gaza Strip. They include many people who fled northern Gaza following Israeli orders to evacuate the area amid an escalation in ground fighting there.

Families who were sheltering at UNRWA schools in the south described overcrowded facilities where food and water were scarce.

Ihab Abedrabo said he had been sheltering with his mother, wife, and six children at a school run by the U.N. agency in the southern city of Khan Younis since a strike damaged their home.

His family, like thousands of others, had fled to the school hoping that they would be safe. But Mr. Abedrabo said that when a strike hit nearby earlier this week and sent shrapnel into the school, he again feared for his relatives’ lives.

“No place is safe,” he said. “However, I can’t think of a safer place to go.”

Emergency medical workers from the Red Crescent and the W.H.O., a United Nations agency, took the infants by ambulance to Al-Helal Emirati Maternity Hospital in Rafah, where they were receiving urgent care.

The W.H.O. said in a statement that 11 of the babies were in critical condition and that all were fighting serious infections. Two others died before the evacuation could take place, according to the agency.

“Sadly, none of the infants were accompanied by family members, as the Ministry of Health has only limited information, and is not currently able to find close family members,” the agency said."

265,265,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/19/opinion/right-wing-antisemitism-populism.html,"A dam burst last week on the right, and a wave of grotesque antisemitism poured out all over the internet.

In August, I wrote about the “lost boys” of the American right, many of them young and relatively unknown, who were outed for having secret or anonymous online profiles and using those profiles to spread raw bigotry, including antisemitism. Some of these people worked for the right wing’s biggest names, including Tucker Carlson, Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump.

What started in the shadows is now right in the open. It’s being advanced by some of the most powerful and influential people in America, and there is nothing subtle about it. The latest eruption started with a fight between the Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro and his Daily Wire colleague Candace Owens. Both are immensely popular right-wing stars. Owens, for example, has more than four million followers on X, formerly known as Twitter, and more than five million on Instagram.

On Nov. 3, Owens posted on social media, “No government anywhere has a right to commit a genocide, ever. There is no justification for a genocide. I can’t believe this even needs to be said or is even considered the least bit controversial to state.” Many of her followers interpreted this as a criticism of Israel, and Shapiro, who staunchly supports Israel in its present conflict with Hamas, was later caught on tape at a private event saying Owens’s behavior during the war has been “disgraceful.”

Daily Wire drama should be of little interest to anyone outside The Daily Wire, but what happened next was truly alarming. First, Jason Whitlock, a leading personality at The Blaze, one of the largest right-wing websites, accused Shapiro of dual loyalties: “The guy has multiple loyalties. He loves America, but he loves Israel too. And maybe he loves Israel and he loves America too.” Owens, he said, “is a bit more America first. She only has one loyalty.”

Then Owens went on Carlson’s show on X, where he ranted against the “biggest donors at, say, Harvard,” asking where they were when members of the Harvard community “were calling for white genocide.”

“White genocide” is a term of art on the racist right and is linked to the so-called great replacement theory, the notion that leftists (including Jewish progressives) are trying to import people of color to replace America’s white majority. This is the theory that motivated the shooter in the Tree of Life synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh. It is false, evil and very dangerous.

The same day, an obscure far-right personality posted the same conspiracy theory on X: “Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.”

“I’m deeply disinterested,” he continued, “in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don’t exactly like them too much.”

The post wouldn’t be notable, except as yet another example of the bigoted filth that dominates discourse on X, but Elon Musk — the world’s richest man and the owner of X — responded with an endorsement. “You have said the actual truth,” he replied.

Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, one of the largest right-wing youth organizations in the country, jumped in the next day to defend both the original post and Musk on “The Charlie Kirk Show.” While he hedged by saying that he doesn’t like to generalize, Kirk argued that “the first part” of the original post “is absolutely true.” He then reread the post and repeated the old Jews-and-money trope: “It is true that some of the largest financiers of left-wing anti-white causes have been Jewish Americans.”

While there are more examples of right-wing antisemitism spilling into the public square, I’m going to stop there. I by no means want to minimize the antisemitism we’ve seen from the far left, including on campuses and in the streets, but I am focusing on the people I just mentioned because they are some of the most prominent figures on the right.

What is going on? For the past several decades, the Republican Party has been a strong ally of Israel, so much so that the regard evangelical voters have for Israel has been the subject of considerable criticism. In my years as a Republican and a conservative lawyer, I never witnessed a trace of antisemitism. The answer to my question, however, is clear. The “new” American right isn’t that new at all. It has rejected Reaganism, yes, but in doing so, it’s reconnecting with older and darker forces on the right.

The ghost of Charles Lindbergh is haunting us. Lindbergh, readers may recall, was the hero aviator who flew solo across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927. He later grew to admire German fascism and gave a famous speech in September 1941 in which he accused Jews of attempting to push America into World War II.

“The three most important groups who have been pressing this country toward war,” he said, “are the British, the Jewish and the Roosevelt administration.” And while Lindbergh expressed sympathy for Jews facing Nazi persecution, he went straight to the same tropes that were deployed last week, claiming that the Jewish people’s “greatest danger to this country lies in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio and our government.”

More recently, we have seen the influence of Pat Buchanan, a former Richard Nixon speechwriter and so-called paleoconservative whom William F. Buckley Jr. denounced for his antisemitism in 1991. A central part of the case against Buchanan once again related to matters of war and peace. In the run-up to the first Iraq war, Buchanan said, “There are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East — the Israeli Defense Ministry and its amen corner in the United States.” And that was a benign comment compared with many of his later pronouncements. In 2010 he wrote that if Elena Kagan were to be confirmed as a Supreme Court justice, “Jews, who represent less than 2 percent of the U.S. population, will have 33 percent of the Supreme Court seats. Is this Democrats’ idea of diversity?”

Buchanan is no minor figure. As Nicole Hemmer wrote in 2022, his presidential campaigns in the 1990s forecast the present moment in Republican politics. The party “traded Reaganism for Buchananism,” she contended. The evidence that she was correct grows by the day.

Everything about the New Right mind-set told us that this devolution was inevitable. It scorns character, decency and civility in the public square, often turning cruelty into a virtue. This was a necessary precondition for the entire enterprise. Decent people can be misguided, certainly, but they are not consumed with hate. Decent people do not indulge bigots.

The New Right rejects the norms and values of what it calls the uniparty or the cathedral: the center-left and center-right American elite. And one of those values is a steadfast opposition to racism and prejudice. The rejection first manifests itself in the form of just asking questions, then it veers into direct challenge of conventional norms, followed by a descent into true darkness.

Hostility unmoored from character quickly turns conspiratorial, and the world of conspiracy theories is where antisemites live and thrive. And finally, the term “America First,” popular with the New Right and the older, Lindbergh right, has always been misleading. It actually means some Americans first or “real” Americans first, and “real” Americans do not include the ideological or religious enemies of the New Right.

It is no coincidence, for example, that after the Owens-Shapiro confrontation, many New Right figures began posting “Christ is king,” an obvious shot at Shapiro’s Jewish beliefs.

Evolution is a concept that applies to biology, not human nature. It turns out that humanity does not grow out of the darkness of the past. It has to be contested by every generation. We are neither imprisoned by darkness nor ever fully captured by light.

America is no exception. From before the founding, our so-called new world has been plagued by all the sins of the old. Set against that human depravity, however, are the great aspirations of the founding, including the central declaration that “all men are created equal.”

American progress was never inevitable. It took immense courage to move haltingly to the more just, more fair country we live in today. We can’t presume that progress is permanent. It never is. No one is more aware of that than America’s most marginalized and vulnerable communities. They feel the effects very keenly when we take steps backward, when our commitment to our principles falters in the face of our own sin."
266,266,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/04/us/politics/obama-israel-palestine.html,"Barack Obama offered a complex analysis of the conflict between Israel and Gaza, telling thousands of former aides that they were all “complicit to some degree” in the current bloodshed.

“I look at this, and I think back, ‘What could I have done during my presidency to move this forward, as hard as I tried?’” he said in an interview conducted by his former staffers for their podcast, Pod Save America. “But there’s a part of me that’s still saying, ‘Well, was there something else I could have done?’”

Mr. Obama entered the White House convinced he could be the president who would resolve the decades-old conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. He left office after years of friction and mistrust with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who was frustrated by the president’s masterminding of the Iran nuclear deal and by his demands that Israel suspend new settlements.

In his comments on Friday, delivered at a gathering of his former staff in Chicago, Mr. Obama acknowledged the strong emotions the war had raised, saying that “this is century-old stuff that’s coming to the fore.” He blamed social media for amplifying the divisions and reducing a thorny international dispute to what he viewed as sloganeering.

Yet he urged his former aides to “take in the whole truth,” seemingly attempting to strike a balance between the killings on both sides.

“What Hamas did was horrific, and there’s no justification for it,” Mr. Obama said. “And what is also true is that the occupation and what’s happening to Palestinians is unbearable.”

He continued: “And what is also true is that there is a history of the Jewish people that may be dismissed unless your grandparents or your great-grandparents, or your uncle or your aunt tell you stories about the madness of antisemitism. And what is true is that there are people right now who are dying, who have nothing to do with what Hamas did.”

Still, Mr. Obama appeared to acknowledge the limits of his musings about bridging divides and embracing complexity.

“Even what I just said, which sounds very persuasive, still doesn’t answer the fact of, all right, how do we prevent kids from being killed today?” he said. “But the problem is that if you are dug in on that, well, the other side is dug in remembering the videos that Hamas took or what they did on the 7th, and they’re dug in, too, which means we will not stop those kids from dying.”"

Mr. Netanyahu’s swift action came amid an immediate and broad outcry over the comments made on Sunday morning by Amichay Eliyahu, the minister of heritage from the ultranationalist Jewish Power party. In his remarks, made to a Hebrew radio station, Mr. Eliyahu also said that there was no such thing as noncombatants in Gaza.

While the Jewish Power Party is a member of Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition government, Mr. Eliyahu is not a member of the war cabinet prosecuting Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza.

Still, his abrupt suspension appeared to reflect Mr. Netanyahu’s concerns both over the low levels of public confidence in his leadership, as shown by recent opinion polls, and the challenges Israel faces in maintaining international support amid its assault in Gaza, particularly given the high civilian death toll there."

“Where is Khalil?” he continued, barely audible between sobs as he asked for his 12-year-old brother. A morgue worker opened a white shroud, so Khaled could kiss his brother one final time.

Then, he bid farewell to his 8-month-old sister. Another shroud was pulled back, revealing the blood-caked face of a baby, her strawberry-red hair matted down. Khaled broke into fresh sobs as he identified her to the hospital staff. Her name was Misk, Arabic for musk.

In the weeks since, mental health professionals have scrambled to figure out how to help the party’s survivors, some of whose trauma may have been compounded by the effect of psychedelics like LSD that are commonplace at trance events and that some of the survivors acknowledged having taken. Those who took it would have been wide-eyed and exceptionally sensate when Hamas rockets began appearing in the sky.

272,272,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/style/star-david-necklace-jewish-antisemitism.html,"About four years ago, after the deadly shooting at a synagogue in Poway, Calif., in April 2019, Abby Adams and Sammy Gabbai started an Instagram account to share stories of Jewish solidarity. The account, Why I Wear My Star, featured posts containing people’s reasons for wearing Star of David jewelry and other Judaica.

Ms. Adams and Ms. Gabbai, who are both Jewish, said they had largely stopped updating the account until recently. They started posting again after Hamas attackers killed about 1,200 people in a surprise assault on Israel on Oct. 7.

Ms. Gabbai, now 21 and a senior at Florida State University, said the Instagram account is not intended to be pro-Israel. She said that she and Ms. Adams, now 21 and a senior at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, have used it to share stories — some of which are anonymous — about why people are proud to be Jewish, “whether they’re Israeli, American, German,” as she put it.

The six-point hexagram is not only seen as symbolic of Jewish pride. The star, which is rendered in blue on the Israeli flag, is also seen by many as a symbol of support for the state of Israel.

Rachie Shnay, a jewelry designer in Manhattan, said she saw several people wearing star accessories at a rally for Israel held by Jewish groups in Washington on Tuesday. “It was the most empowering feeling,” said Ms. Shnay, 34, who added that her grandparents were Holocaust survivors.

The Star of David, called Magen David in Hebrew, was used by Jews in Prague as early as the 1600s. By the 1800s, it had come to be broadly associated with the Jewish population. Jonathan Sarna, a professor of American Jewish History at Brandeis University, said a Zionist flag designed in 1891 by a rabbi in Boston closely resembles the Israeli flag.

During the Holocaust, the Nazis demanded that yellow stars be worn as badges by Jews as a form of identification. Some people worry that wearing the star or other items like a kipa (a skullcap) and tzitzit (ritual tassels) in public can invite antisemitic reactions. But as antisemitism has spread online, domestically and around the world since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, Ms. Adams and others have found personal style to be a way to embrace and display their heritage.

Nelly Bulkin, 50, said she was concerned when her 18-year-old daughter, Sophie, a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley, felt strongly about showing her Jewish identity and her solidarity with Israeli citizens on campus after Hamas’s Oct. 7 assault.

“My relatives were in concentration camps, lived in ghettos, were killed in pogroms,” Ms. Bulkin said. She said that she and her husband, who live in San Diego, both immigrated to the United States from Eastern Europe and were raised by parents who had to hide their Jewishness.

Sophie Bulkin, who wears a small necklace with the words of the Shema, a Jewish proclamation of faith, in Hebrew and English, said such sartorial displays are a way to honor “what all these people who have died for my religion have done for me in the past.”"

Earlier in the afternoon, several rallies attracting hundreds of people formed at different points around the city, including Union Square, the J.P. Morgan offices on Madison Avenue and Gov. Kathy Hochul’s New York office near the United Nations headquarters, before merging on the steps of the New York Public Library near Bryant Park. The group then began its march through Midtown Manhattan.

As demonstrators wound their way through the center of the city, they waved Palestinian flags, held handmade signs with messages like “Ceasefire now,” and chanted, “Free Palestine.” The crowd stretched several blocks and paused at times in front of Pennsylvania Station and the New York Times building.

Debbie Bitar, 69, who marched with a Palestinian flag draped over her shoulders, said she hoped the gatherings would catch the attention of politicians and pressure them to call for a cease-fire and to end the United States’ aid to Israel.

“Every day I am watching Palestinian people get massacred,” Ms. Bitar said. “This can’t keep happening.” Hamas’s attack on Israel on Oct. 7 killed about 1,200, according to the Israeli authorities, and the death toll in Gaza, according to Gazan health officials, has crossed 11,000.

It was not clear what caused the fire, or how recently the plant had been operating.

The fire broke out amid a water crisis in Gaza, with UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, warning that 70 percent of people in the Gaza Strip are drinking contaminated water. With critical infrastructure destroyed and relatively few trucks carrying fuel and water permitted to enter Gaza, the water emergency has only spiraled.

Blinken, with an assist from the Pentagon, spent the weekend reinforcing the notion that the United States was not going anywhere.

During a quick trip to the region, Mr. Blinken repeatedly warned Iran against using its proxies to widen the conflict between Israel and Hamas, while in an unusual move the U.S. Central Command, which oversees American forces in the region, on Sunday announced that a nuclear-powered submarine was traveling through the region.

The submarine added to the already considerable American firepower steaming through the waters around the Middle East, and Central Command, as if flaunting the vessel’s deployment, went so far as to post on X a photo of it in the region.

The most important progress, however, occurred out of public view. American allies in the Middle East have played a crucial role in preventing Iran and its proxies from expanding the war. Mr. Blinken sought to maintain those efforts during his trip, which included stops in Israel, Jordan, Iraq and Turkey.

Mr. Blinken added: “Sometimes the absence of something bad happening may not be the most obvious evidence of progress, but it is.”

Heading off any escalation by Iran or its proxies in the region is a priority for U.S. officials. The roughly 3,500 U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria have already been subjected to more than 40 drone and rocket attacks by Iran-aligned militias since Hamas invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7, and a wider regional conflict would likely draw American forces deeper into the fight.

The United States, citing retaliation for the rocket and drone attacks against U.S. forces, carried out two airstrikes last week on sites in eastern Syria that it said were used by Iran and its proxies.

But beyond emphasizing the stakes of any escalation to Iran, Mr. Blinken’s trip appeared to have far more mixed results. While American officials said the Israelis appeared to be willing to allow a sharp expansion in humanitarian aid into Gaza, they have had less success convincing Israel to show more military restraint in an attempt to reduce the number of civilian casualties.

At the same time, the United States’ most important Arab allies, including Jordan and Egypt, have started to put real pressure on the Biden administration to rein in the Israelis, fearful that the conflict could destabilize their countries. The constant stream of images of dead Palestinians has been stoking widespread anger, and Arab leaders affirmed privately to Mr. Blinken that their public talk of a cease-fire wasn’t hollow. They need one immediately, they told Mr. Blinken."
277,277,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/world/middleeast/northern-gaza-israel-hamas-war-ruins.html,"When a group of international journalists arrived at the southern fringe of Gaza City early Friday morning, riding in the back of an Israeli army jeep, we struggled to orient ourselves amid the ruins, the wreckage and the darkness.

Since leaving Israel less than an hour earlier, our jeep had bumped and lurched through a landscape so disfigured by 42 days of airstrikes and nearly three weeks of ground warfare that it was hard at times to understand where we were. House after house was missing a wall or a roof, or both. Many had simply been flattened, their concrete floors lying atop one another like a pack of playing cards.

Trying to situate myself after reaching Gaza City, I asked a senior Israeli commander where we were in relation to a fishing port where I usually stayed during visits to Gaza before the war.

“Three hundred meters north,” the commander said.

I was stunned. Without realizing it, we had arrived at the Gazan neighborhood that I knew best."
278,278,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/briefing/israel-hamas-hospital-openai-sam-altman.html,"Early this morning, three of my colleagues visited Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest medical complex, which has become central to the war between Israel and Hamas.

There, the Israeli military escorted them to a stone-and-concrete shaft with a staircase descending into the earth. It was evidence, Israeli officials asserted, of a Hamas military facility under the hospital. But a commander said that the forces, fearing booby traps, had not ventured down the shaft.

The controlled visit did not settle the question of whether Hamas had been using Al-Shifa to hide weapons and command centers, as Israel has said. But it did offer my colleagues a rare opportunity to witness the wartime conditions inside Gaza City.

Our Jerusalem bureau chief, Patrick Kingsley, described houses flattened like playing cards, and a city utterly disfigured. They drove into a neighborhood Patrick had visited a dozen times over the past three years, yet he could hardly recognize it."
279,279,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/arts/design/documenta-committee-resign-israel-gaza.html,"Documenta, the German contemporary art exhibition considered one of the most prestigious in the world, fell into crisis this week after the entire team tasked with finding its next artistic director resigned after a series of disputes with administrators related to the Israel-Hamas War.

The break up of the committee meant the start date for Documenta’s next edition may have to be pushed back later than 2027, when it was scheduled to open in Kassel, Germany, a Documenta spokeswoman said in an email.

The last four members of the search committee stepped down Thursday, just days after its other two members had resigned, all for reasons related to the ongoing war in Israel and Gaza and the debate surrounding it in Germany.

The four who resigned on Thursday night — Simon Njami, Gong Yan, Kathrin Rhomberg and María Inés Rodríguez, who are museum directors and curators — said in an open letter that they were stepping aside in part because the political climate in Germany around the war in Israel and Gaza meant it now appeared impossible to stage an art show that allows “diverse perspectives, perceptions and discourses.”

In a news release Documenta, which is rivaled only by the Venice Biennale for art world prestige and public attendance, acknowledged the search committee’s work had become fraught “in view of the terrorist attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, and the growing antisemitism in Germany as well as the polarized debates surrounding it.” Documenta’s board and staff would now try to work out how the selection process could proceed, the news release said.

The crisis started on Nov. 10, when Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger, who is Israeli, resigned after administrators rejected her request for a pause in the committee’s search, in recognition of the recent deaths in Israel and Gaza.

On Nov. 12, Ranjit Hoskote, an Indian art critic and poet, resigned from the Documenta committee after the administrators repeatedly urged him to distance himself from a petition he had signed in 2019, about an event in India on the links between Hindu nationalism and Zionism, that described Israel as an apartheid state.

The upheaval at Documenta is just one example of how Europe’s art world is being torn by debates about Israel and Gaza, as some institutions have moved to postpone the shows of artists who have criticized Israel.

On Monday, the Folkwang Museum in Essen, Germany, ended a collaboration with Anaïs Duplan, a Haitian curator based in the United States, just days before an exhibition his studio was working on was scheduled to open. The museum said in an email to Duplan — which the artist posted to Instagram — that he had made unacceptable social media posts describing Israel’s actions in Gaza as genocide. (In an emailed statement, the museum said that it instead was posts on Duplan’s Instagram supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel, of B.D.S., that led to the decision.)

The following day, the Art Newspaper reported that the Lisson Gallery in London had canceled a show by Ai Weiwei, the popular Chinese artist, scheduled to open on Nov. 15, after he wrote on X about how the “Jewish community” had a significant influence in the United States. “The sense of guilt around the persecution of the Jewish people has been, at times, transferred to offset the Arab world,” Ai added in the post from Oct. 24.

In an email, Ai said that he had three other shows canceled, too, because of the post — one at Lisson in New York, in 2024, as well as shows at Galerie Max Hetzler in Paris and Berlin — and that he did not understand the decisions. “What baffles me is why a gallery would stifle my expression and moral judgment,” Ai said of Lisson’s move. (A Lisson spokeswoman said in an email that its shows had been postponed in agreement with the artist.)

For the artists and curators involved, the cancellations are a growing concern, but to some politicians in Germany, this is an overreaction. On Thursday, Claudia Roth, Germany’s culture minister, said in an interview with Die Zeit, a German newspaper, that the idea that institutions now had to Google whether artists supported a boycott of Israel was “complete nonsense.”

Protecting artistic freedom was one of her most important jobs, she said, although that freedom had its limits if it crossed into hate speech, especially at a time of rising antisemitism in Germany.

Documenta was initially staged in 1955 as the first large-scale exhibition in West Germany of the art of the European avant-garde. It was a direct response to the Degenerate Art Show, the denunciatory exhibition of modern art staged by the Nazis in Munich in 1937. Each edition since then — it now takes place twice a decade, from June to September, and is known as a “Museum of 100 Days” — has attempted to bring the art of the whole world to Germany.

But it has struggled to move forward following its highly polarizing 2022 edition, which brought Documenta’s global ambitions into direct conflict with Germany’s “memory culture” or institutional efforts to face its Nazi past. It opened with the prominent display of an agitprop mural from Indonesia that included antisemitic caricatures. Although the mural was taken down, it set off a monthslong debate in Germany’s art world about antisemitism, Palestinian activism and Germany’s relationship to formerly colonized countries. The show’s director-general resigned that summer. Its artistic leadership was called to testify before parliament, and officials threatened to revoke funding.

Hoskote said Documenta was one of the art world’s greatest events, partly because it had always been a forum for new ideas. He worried that core idea was now at risk. In Germany, at least, he said, art institutions seemed to be losing their focus on the “imagination and creative,” and are instead just focusing on one issue."
280,280,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/nyregion/universities-antisemitic-anti-muslim-investigation.html,"The federal government opened discrimination investigations this week into half a dozen universities, including Columbia, Cooper Union and Cornell in New York, following complaints about antisemitic and anti-Muslim harassment after the Israel-Hamas war broke out.

Since the start of the war on Oct. 7, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has also opened inquiries into Wellesley College in Massachusetts, the University of Pennsylvania and Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, along with a K-12 school district, Maize Unified in Kansas.

The Biden administration opened the investigations as part of “efforts to take aggressive action to address the alarming nationwide rise in reports of antisemitism, anti-Muslim, anti-Arab and other forms of discrimination,” according to a news release published by the Office for Civil Rights.

Catherine E. Lhamon, assistant secretary of education for civil rights, said that the appearance of a school on the list does not “reflect a conclusion that the law has been violated.”

The office is investigating possible violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects students in programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance from discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin. The federal agency did not share any details about what incidents led to the investigations, except to say that they stem from five complaints of antisemitic harassment and two of anti-Muslim harassment.

Protests by pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups on college campuses have intensified tensions between student groups, faculty and administrations in recent weeks. Universities have struggled to contain the blowback as students and faculty raise concerns over both security and free speech.

The conflict over the war has been particularly bitter in New York, which is seeing almost daily demonstrations. The number of hate crimes logged in the city during October was more than double that of the previous October. Antisemitic incidents more than tripled.

On Tuesday, about 400 students gathered at Columbia University to protest the war and to criticize university leaders for suspending two pro-Palestinian student groups through the end of the semester. In the days after the war started, an Israeli student there was assaulted by another student.

Ben Chang, a spokesman for Columbia, said the university had received notification from the civil rights office “and will cooperate with any investigation.”

Earlier this month, Columbia announced the formation of a task force on antisemitism and a group to support individuals whose personal information has been posted online.

Also this month, a student at Cornell University was arrested and charged with making violent antisemitic threats, leading the university to cancel classes for a day. The campus has been on edge, and hosted a visit earlier this month from Gov. Kathy Hochul, who condemned the threats. Cornell officials declined to respond to a request for comment.

At Cooper Union, a confrontation between opposing sides, in which pro-Palestinian students banged on the doors and windows of a library where Jewish students had relocated after a demonstration, became part of the national conversation about the war. There were no arrests or summonses as a result of the incident, the police said.

An email to the university requesting comment was not immediately answered.

And the University of Pennsylvania was already dealing with a backlash over a Palestinian literary conference it hosted before the war broke out. Since then, the campus has been buffeted by criticisms from different sides over its response.

The university said it would cooperate with the investigation and said it was taking steps to address antisemitism.

Other universities are also facing scrutiny over the climate on campus related to the war. Three Jewish students sued New York University this week over what they said was a hostile environment that had allowed antisemitism to go unchecked.

On Wednesday, N.Y.U. announced it would create a Center for the Study of Antisemitism. And John Beckman, a spokesman for N.Y.U., said Wednesday that the claims made in the suit were inaccurate. N.Y.U. was not listed as one of the institutions the federal agency is investigating."
281,281,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/us/politics/biden-israel-gaza-fighting-pause.html,"Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken will urge the Israeli government to agree to a series of brief cessations of military operations in Gaza to allow for hostages to be released safely and for humanitarian aid to be distributed, White House officials said on Thursday.

The message comes as President Biden revealed on Wednesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel had previously agreed to halt shelling briefly on Oct. 20 to allow for the release of two Americans, Judith Raanan, 59, and her daughter, Natalie Raanan, 17.

The push for what American officials call “humanitarian pauses” is one of several subjects Mr. Blinken will raise with Mr. Netanyahu and other officials when he arrives in Israel on Friday for another round of diplomacy amid fierce fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas, the group that controls Gaza.

Speaking to reporters before boarding a plane on his way to the Middle East, Mr. Blinken said part of his mission would be to help ensure that civilians in Gaza were protected as Israel wages its war."
282,282,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/us/students-justice-palestine-campus-protests.html,"Early leaders like Dr. Bazian feared infiltration and disruption, so there was no national chain of command. In an interview, Dr. Bazian, now a lecturer at Berkeley, said that the approach “allows for any campus that sees the principle to initiate a chapter and get going.”

It was not unusual for universities to help underwrite the groups, as they have often done with registered student organizations. Dr. Youmans remembered that the Berkeley chapter of his era “would survive on funding from the university or the equivalent of bake sales.”

The sums have not always been princely. In 2013, the University of Tennessee’s chapter received $550. (Organizers of “Sex Week” were awarded $20,000.) Chapters have often seemed closer to broke than flush.

“The other day, I was like, ‘Why don’t you all make a good banner?’” said Pranav Jani, the faculty adviser to the chapter at Ohio State University, where he is an associate professor. “They were like, ‘Well, we don’t have any money.’”

In Chicago, the chapter at DePaul University sometimes gets donations of falafel or hummus from local restaurants, according to Laila Farah, the chapter’s faculty adviser and an associate professor at the university.

Researchers and pro-Israel groups have spent years trying to trace the network’s funding and have been skeptical of the poverty claims. They note that the national group collects donations, but the amount has not been made public. They have also cited the network’s intellectual and financial connections to American Muslims for Palestine, a Virginia group mired in litigation over whether it is an “alter ego” for a disbanded organization linked to Hamas.

Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president for research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, an organization that has been critical of Hamas, told Congress in 2016 that American Muslims for Palestine was “arguably the most important sponsor and organizer” for the student group. With that support, he told a House committee this past Wednesday, groups like Students for Justice in Palestine “systematically threaten or intimidate Jewish and pro-Israel students.”

Dr. Bazian, now the chairman of American Muslims for Palestine’s board, played down its ties to the student group, which he said were generally limited to providing printed materials and offering grants for students to bring in speakers or attend conferences. He said that his group does not have meaningful power over Students for Justice in Palestine.

The student network’s lack of formal structure has not helped ease concerns. Even after the group developed a national steering committee that helped organize conferences and other resources, critics said, it did not declare itself a nonprofit or formally incorporate.

The steering committee members recoiled at the notion of coast-to-coast infrastructure, even if it could maybe yield more money and more trust.

“It would jeopardize the integrity of our movement as a grass-roots one,” Carrie said.

The steering committee members said that they had no control over campus chapters. The committee, which today has about a dozen members, sees itself as an advisory body, with members saying they offer the local chapters little more than ideas and, from time to time, tools that they can elect to use.

Among the network’s alumni, the national group can come off as informal.

“I tried to reach out to them to say, ‘I was involved, and, hey, if you want to talk,’” Dr. Youmans said of a past entreaty. “They never really got back to me.”"
283,283,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/technology/israel-hamas-war-meta-tiktok-social-media.html,"As the Israel-Hamas war flooded social media with violent content, false information and a seemingly limitless swell of opinions, lawmakers and users have accused platforms like TikTok and Facebook of promoting biased posts.

Tech giants have denied the charges. TikTok, accused of elevating pro-Palestinian content, blamed “unsound analysis” of hashtag data. Some Instagram and Facebook users circulated a petition accusing the platforms’ parent company, Meta, of censoring pro-Palestinian posts, which Meta attributed to a technical bug.

Antisemitic content swarmed onto X, the platform formerly known as Twitter and run by the billionaire Elon Musk. X’s chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, said in a post on Thursday about antisemitism that “there’s no place for it anywhere in the world.”

Where the truth lies, however, is hard to glean, according to academic researchers and advocacy groups. They said the debates over content related to the Israel-Hamas war have highlighted the roadblocks complicating independent analysis of what appears on the major online services. Instead of being able to conduct methodical studies of online discourse, they must try to grasp its scope and effects using inefficient and incomplete methods.

The murkiness enables people to make dubious claims about what is dominant or popular online and allows the platforms to retort with similarly flimsy or warped evidence, limiting accountability on all sides, the researchers said.

“We’re in desperate need of rigorous, informed research on what the actual impact of platforms are on society, and we can’t do that if we don’t have access to data,” said Megan A. Brown, a doctoral student at the University of Michigan who researches the online information ecosystem."
284,284,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/nyregion/nyc-councilwoman-gun-inna-vernikov.html,"A Brooklyn councilwoman who was arrested last month after carrying a pistol to a pro-Palestinian rally at Brooklyn College has had charges dismissed against her after it was found that the weapon was unloaded and inoperable.

The affair began on Oct. 12, five days after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel. The councilwoman, Inna Vernikov, a conservative Republican, attended the demonstration as a counterprotester and live-streamed her criticism.

She suggested that those at the rally were supporters of Hamas who were “nothing short of terrorists without the bombs” and images soon circulated on social media showing Ms. Vernikov carrying a gun whose butt jutted from her waistband.

While Ms. Vernikov had a permit for the weapon — a Smith & Wesson 9-millimeter pistol — she soon turned herself and the gun in and was charged with criminal possession of a firearm, police officials said at the time.

In New York State, openly carrying a firearm is not allowed, and a law passed last year expressly forbids carrying weapons in so-called sensitive locations, a lengthy list that includes “gatherings of people to collectively express their constitutional rights to assemble or protest.”

In a statement on Friday, prosecutors seemed to want to balance First Amendment rights with goals of gun control.

“Peaceful protest is the right of every American, but bringing a gun to a protest is illegal and creates an unacceptable risk of harm that has no place in our city,” said Oren Yaniv, spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney, Eric Gonzalez. He added that the gun was unloaded and missing a piece, making it unusable.

“In order to sustain this charge, it must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the weapon in question was capable of firing bullets,” he said. “Absent such proof, we have no choice but to dismiss these charges.”

Ms. Vernikov, who represents Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay in southern Brooklyn, among other neighborhoods, was overwhelmingly re-elected to a second term in November, weeks after the charges.

Arthur L. Aidala, a lawyer who represented the councilwoman at her arraignment, said that Ms. Vernikov had “an outstanding reputation serving her constituency.”

He added: “She is pleased to have this all behind her, and looks forward to continuing her fight on behalf of all New Yorkers.”

Ms. Vernikov herself had no immediate comment on the charges being dropped, according to her district office.

In her online biography, the councilwoman is identified as a Ukrainian-born lawyer who aims to fight “rising crime, unreasonable mandates and the recent migrant crisis.” She also lists herself as “a leading voice against antisemitism; making waves by bringing stories of antisemitic assaults to the national and international stage.”

Ms. Vernikov’s arrest brought condemnation from a variety of groups and some calls for her to resign, including from the New York Working Families Party, a liberal political group that said “armed intimidation has no place in our city, much less near a place of learning.”"
285,285,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/technology/elon-musk-twitter-x-advertisers.html,"The blowback over Elon Musk’s endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory on X gathered steam on Friday, as several major advertisers on his social media platform cut off their spending after his comments.

Disney said it was pausing spending on X, as did Lionsgate, the entertainment and film distribution company, and Paramount Global, the media giant that owns CBS. Apple, which spends tens of millions of dollars a year on X, also suspended advertising on the platform, a person with knowledge of the situation said. They followed IBM, which cut its spending with X on Thursday.

Mr. Musk, who bought Twitter last year and renamed it X, has been under scrutiny for months for allowing and even stoking antisemitic abuse on the site. That snowballed on Wednesday when the tech billionaire agreed with a post on X that accused Jewish people who are facing antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war of pushing the “exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them” and supporting the immigration of “hordes of minorities.”

“You have said the actual truth,” Mr. Musk replied.

Jewish groups have compared the statement in the original post to a belief known as replacement theory, a conspiracy theory that posits that nonwhite immigrants, organized by Jews, intend to replace the white race. That idea fueled Robert Bowers, who raged against Jewish people online before killing 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018.

On Friday, the White House condemned Mr. Musk, 52, for boosting the anti-Jewish conspiracy theory. Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that it was “unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust.”

An X spokesman declined to comment on the advertising pauses, and Apple didn’t respond. Axios reported earlier on Apple’s decision, and Bloomberg reported earlier on the Lionsgate suspension.

Linda Yaccarino, X’s chief executive, posted on the site on Thursday that the company had been “extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination.” But on Friday, Mr. Musk agreed with a post on X that suggested advertisers like IBM were pulling back from the platform to save face.

He later said accounts that made “clear calls for extreme violence"" would be suspended, highlighting two phrases associated with Palestinian supporters that would not be tolerated on the site."
286,286,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/opinion/israel-democratic-party-jamaal-bowman.html,"As the left-leaning journalist Ryan Grim points out in his forthcoming book, “The Squad: AOC and the Hope of a Political Revolution,” the politics of Israel and Palestine have bedeviled the group ever since its first members burst onto the political scene in 2018.

The most famous figure in the Squad, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, rarely spoke about the Middle East in 2018, during her first congressional campaign, which was centered on the same economic issues that powered the Bernie Sanders movement. But that May, she’d tweeted about the Israeli military’s shooting of protesters in Gaza, calling it a “massacre.” After her primary victory, she was questioned about that tweet, and her stance on Israel, on the TV show “Firing Line.” She grew visibly flustered, and afterward decided to stop doing national interviews for a while.

“At the time, she betrayed a visceral sense of just how treacherous the issue could be for her, but she could never have guessed how significantly she had underestimated it,” wrote Grim.

It was even more treacherous for Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, the first two Muslim women in Congress, who’ve both voiced support for the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel. Both spoke for many left-wing voters, especially young ones, who see in the Palestinian struggle a reflection of their own battles against various forms of oppression. Both also, occasionally, invoked what many Jews see as antisemitic tropes about Jewish power and dual loyalty. Less than a week into her first term, for example, Tlaib tweeted that Senate supporters of an anti-B.D.S. bill “forgot what country they represent.” Not long after, Omar tweeted that fealty to Israel by U.S. political leaders was “all about the Benjamins.” Some of the early weeks of the new congressional session were consumed by an attempt, eventually watered down, to officially rebuke her.

Soon after the original members of the Squad were sworn in in 2019, Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who once did work for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, started a group called the Democratic Majority for Israel aimed in part at stopping their influence from growing. “Most Democrats are strongly pro-Israel and we want to keep it that way,” Mellman told The Times. “There are a few discordant voices, but we want to make sure that what’s a very small problem doesn’t metastasize into a bigger problem.”

To that end, the Democratic Majority for Israel tried hard to thwart Bowman when he ran against Eliot Engel in 2020. The group spent almost $2 million in the race, much of it on ads slamming Bowman for unpaid taxes. As Grim noted, hitting “a working-class Black man for financial troubles before he’d risen to become a successful principal in the area would have been considered tone-deaf in a New York Democratic primary in any recent cycle,” but especially amid the summer’s protests over the killing of George Floyd. The attack failed; Bowman ended up winning a blowout 15-point victory.

The district, whose contours have changed with redistricting and could change again before the primary, is about 50 percent Black and Latino, and voters of color were Bowman’s base. But they were joined by some Jews, who are thought to make up about 10 percent of the district’s population. “It was the time,” said Giddins, the Bronxville retiree, who backed Bowman in the past. “We have to coalesce and give Black people power. They’re entitled to it.”

But despite Bowman’s popularity, growing disaffection among Jews — who, according to The New York Times, probably make up 20 percent to 30 percent of the Democratic primary electorate in his district — could make him vulnerable. He’s one of several Squad members facing potentially formidable primary challenges over their stances on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Omar is going to have a rematch against a former Minneapolis City Council member, Don Samuels, who lost to her by about two points in the 2022 primary. Cori Bush, a Missouri Democrat who emerged from the Black Lives Matter movement, is facing a primary challenge from a former political ally, the St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell. Summer Lee, a Pittsburgh Democrat whose district includes the Tree of Life synagogue, the site of an antisemitic mass murder in 2018, is being challenged by Bhavini Patel.

Bowman doesn’t have a strong opponent yet, but last month 26 rabbis in his district wrote a letter to Westchester’s popular county executive, George Latimer, imploring him to get into the race. Last week, a local TV station reported that Latimer had indeed decided to jump in, though he told me he still hadn’t made a formal decision and wouldn’t until he returned from a solidarity trip to Israel.

Should a few members of the Squad lose their primaries, the blow to Democratic unity could be severe. “Many of the young people or people of color, Muslim and Arab Democrats who support the Squad will feel like the party is not a place for them,” said Waleed Shahid, former communications director of the Justice Democrats, the group that recruited Ocasio-Cortez to run for office, and a senior adviser on Bowman’s 2020 campaign. “And they’ll either stay at home or they’ll go to a third party.”

Already, there are signs that the party is fracturing over Israel. According to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, about three-quarters of Democrats want a cease-fire, but few in the Democratic establishment share their views. Last week, in a rare gesture of defiance, more than 100 congressional staffers walked out to demand that their bosses back a cease-fire. More than 500 alumni of Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign and Democratic Party staff members have signed a letter imploring Biden to call for a cease-fire, saying, “If you fail to act swiftly, your legacy will be complicity in the face of genocide.”

If the conflict in Israel cools down in a few months, it might recede from the center of American politics. But the wounds it’s torn open will be hard to mend, because so many people are feeling betrayed. Many liberal Jews, mourning the mass murder in Israel and shaken by the upsurge of antisemitism at home, believe they’ve been abandoned by their allies. Advocates for the freedom and safety of Palestinians — horror-struck by more than 10,000 civilian deaths in Gaza, according to calculations based on the Gaza Health Ministry’s death count — believe that the Democratic Party is giving its approval to atrocities. Bowman’s attempt to transcend this split in his own district, knowing how much ire would be directed at him, struck me as decent and brave. But when people discover that they see the world so radically differently, better communication alone might not be enough to bring them back together.

From the time he was elected, Bowman has had to traverse a minefield on the Middle East, facing pressure from both his pro-Israel Jewish constituents and from some of the left-wing groups that backed him. He’s mostly refused to tiptoe. Coming into office, Bowman was a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, but he angered the organization when he voted to fund Israel’s Iron Dome defense system. After he traveled to Israel and the West Bank with the left-leaning pro-Israel group J Street in 2021, some in the Democratic Socialists, which has a policy of boycotting Israel, moved to expel him. He ended up dropping his membership.

For all the blowback from the left, however, the trip solidified his abhorrence of the occupation of Palestine. “I got to see the giant wall built around the West Bank,” Bowman told me. He described being turned away from a checkpoint in the West Bank city of Hebron, where Palestinian movement is curtailed to accommodate a few hundred fanatical settlers, because he wasn’t Jewish. “And I thought that was ironic, because I’m literally a sitting member of Congress voting to support funding for the state of Israel,” he said.

He saw firsthand the way settlement expansion is making a contiguous Palestinian state nearly impossible. “I left feeling pretty overwhelmed and pretty dejected,” Bowman said, adding, “The rhetoric at home didn’t match the reality on the ground there, and specifically, the rhetoric around a two-state solution.” Bowman still believes in two states, but said, “The policies of the Israeli government haven’t gotten us there, and the U.S. hasn’t held Israel accountable towards helping us to get there.”

“At Jamaal’s core, he’s someone who believes in racial and social justice,” said Shahid, his former adviser. “And I think that a lot of the ways he thinks about the world were confirmed” by his trip to Israel. Shahid compared Bowman’s experience to that of the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, who, speaking on the left-wing broadcast “Democracy Now,” described his own shocking encounter with the brutal segregation in Hebron. “I was in a territory where your mobility is inhibited,” said Coates. “Where your voting rights are inhibited. Where your right to the water is inhibited. Where your right to housing is inhibited, and it’s all inhibited based on ethnicity. And that sounded extremely, extremely familiar to me.”

It was familiar to Bowman, too. Given the congressman’s “experience as a racially conscious Black person,” said Shahid, “it’s hard not to see the parallels.”

Before going to Israel and Palestine, Bowman had co-sponsored legislation encouraging Arab states to normalize their relations with Israel. When he returned, he withdrew his sponsorship and announced he’d vote against the bill because, among other things, it didn’t take Palestinian interests into account. The move appalled rabbis in his district. Later, Bowman angered many Jewish constituents by co-sponsoring Tlaib’s resolution commemorating what Palestinians call the nakba, or catastrophe, referring to their expulsion from Israel during the country’s founding. He angered them further by boycotting the speech by Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, to Congress in July.

Oct. 7 brought an already simmering discontent to a raging boil. A few days after the attacks, Bowman wanted to attend an Israeli solidarity rally held by the Westchester Jewish Council, but organizers advised him to stay away because he’d be received poorly. He has spoken out repeatedly against antisemitism, denouncing, for example, an Oct. 8 demonstration in Manhattan, promoted by the New York Democratic Socialists of America, where Hamas’s attacks were celebrated. But he hasn’t backed away from his fundamental view of the conflict, leaving the mainstream Jewish community feeling as if he’s run roughshod over their interests and sensitivities. “Actions against Israel affect the safety of the Jewish people everywhere,” said Weinberger, the woman with two children in Israel, adding, “We feel so helpless in Congress because of him. He’s taken our voice away.”

In 2022, despite mounting unhappiness with Bowman among some local Jewish leaders, national pro-Israel groups sat out his primary, determining, as Jewish Insider reported, that he “was likely unbeatable.” (He ended up winning about 57 percent of the vote in a four-way race.) But pro-Israel groups — one of which received funds from the disgraced crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried — poured an unprecedented amount of money into other primaries that year, a foretaste of the resources we could soon see mobilized against Bowman.

As Politico reported, the Democratic Majority for Israel spent $2 million to defeat the Bernie Sanders-backed Democrat Nina Turner in a 2022 Ohio primary. In Michigan, the United Democracy Project, a super PAC tied to AIPAC, spent a staggering $4.3 million to help beat Representative Andy Levin, a Jewish Democrat who had been outspoken in his criticism of Israel’s occupation. Some funding for the United Democracy Project came from Republican megadonors, including the Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, a Trump supporter. These are not, needless to say, people who are averse to creating lasting ill will among Democrats.

“I’ve been in politics for 30 years, local, state and federal,” said Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat and former co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “But last cycle was the first time I saw a really disturbing new phenomenon, which was two groups — cryptocurrency folks and AIPAC — getting involved in Democratic primaries with huge amounts of money,” often more than the candidates were spending themselves. We can expect to see even more outside money from groups supporting Israel deployed against the Squad in 2024. “The level of concern and engagement on the part of the pro-Israel community is at an extraordinarily high level,” Mellman, of Democratic Majority for Israel, told me.

These big-footed donors, who are overwhelmingly targeting representatives of color, are going to exacerbate the fissures in the Democratic Party. But they did not create them. Talking to some of the disenchanted voters at Bowman’s event, I was struck most not by their anger but by their heartbreak.

Diana Lovett, a Democratic Party district leader who held a fund-raiser for Bowman last year, said polarization over the congressman was tearing apart local Democrats. Leaving the event, she told me, with great sadness, that she didn’t feel she could back him anymore. “I love him personally,” she said. She’d spoken to him in October about their disagreement over Israel. “He was lovely, and he’s amazing, and he was the same warm and openhearted person that he was today,” she said.

But Lovett, who’d recently been hanging posters of kidnapped Israelis around town only to see them being torn down, had come to believe that their views on the Middle East are irreconcilable. “I think he sees what he believes to be an injustice, a grave injustice,” and that his votes are coming from a deep “moral consciousness,” she said. “And I think the pain and suffering he is causing to his constituents is some kind of collateral damage to that higher principle.”

If Bowman were a more transactional politician, he might have compromised on an issue so fraught in his community. But he is, for better or worse, very sincere. Lovett was dreading “an insanely divisive primary,” but didn’t see any way around it. “He’s not going to convince us, and we’re not going to convince him,” she said."

From New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.” [MUSIC PLAYING] Everything I’m about to talk about is hard to talk about. It is hard to talk about because it’s personal to me. It’s hard to talk about because it’s happening in the midst of an active hellacious war. And it’s hard to talk about because even when there is not a war, this is just hard to talk about. Maybe I’ll start here. I think something we’re seeing in the politics in America around Israel right now, I think it reflects three generations with very different lived experiences of what Israel is. You have older Americans, say, Joe Biden, who saw Israel as the haven for the Jews and who also saw Israel when it was weak and small, when it really could have been wiped off the map by its neighbors. They have a lived sense of Israel’s impossibility and its vulnerability and the dangers of the neighborhood in which it is in. Their views of Israel formed around the Israel of the Six-Day War in 1967, when its neighbors massed to try and strangle Israel when it was young, or the Yom Kippur War in 1973, when they surprise attacked Israel 50 years ago. Then there is the next generation, my generation, I think. And I think of us as this straddle generation. We only ever knew a strong Israel, an Israel that was undoubtedly the strongest country in the region, a nuclear Israel, an Israel backed by America’s unwavering military and political support. That wasn’t always true, at least not to the extent now. In his great book, “The Much Too Promised Land,” Aaron David Miller points out that before the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Israel ranked 24th in foreign aid from the US, 24th. Within a few years of that war, it ranked first, as it typically has since. We also knew an Israel that was an occupying force, a country that could and did impose its will on Palestinians, and I don’t want to be euphemistic about this, an Israel in which Palestinians were an oppressed class, where their lives and their security and their freedom were worth less. But we also knew an Israel that had a strong peace movement, where the moral horror of that occupation was widely recognized. We knew an Israel where the leaders were trying imperfectly, but seriously and continuously, to become something better, to become something different, to become in the eyes of the world what Israel was in its own eyes, a Jewish state, but a humane and moral one. And then, as Yossi Klein Halevi described on the show recently, that peace movement collapsed. The why of this is no mystery. The Second Intifada, the endless suicide bombings were a trauma Israel still has not recovered from. And they posed a horrible question, to which the left, both in Israel and in America, had no real answer then or now. If your story of all this is simplistic, if it is just that Israel wanted this, it is wrong. But what happened then is Israel moved right and further right and further right. Extremists once on the margin of Israeli politics and society became cabinet ministers and coalition members. The settlers in the West Bank ran wild, functionally annexing more and more territory, sometimes violently, territory that was meant to be returned to Palestinians, and doing so with the backing of the Israeli state, doing so in a way that made a two-state solution look less and less possible. Israel withdrew from Gaza, and when Hamas took control, they blockaded Gaza, leaving Gazans to misery, to poverty. Israel stopped trying to become something other than an occupier nation. It became deeply illiberal. It settled into a strategy of security through subjugation. And many in its government openly desired expansion through expulsion. And so now you have this generation, the one coming of age now, the one that has only known this Israel, Netanyahu’s Israel, Ben-Gvir’s Israel. I’ve been thinking a lot about the panic in the Jewish community, about what gets short-handed as antisemitism on campus. And there is antisemitism on campus and on the left and on the right — always has been. But to read only the most anti-Semitic signs in a rally, to hear only the anti-Semitic chants, can also obscure what else is happening there. If it’s just antisemitism, then at least it is simple. They just hate the Jews. They hate us. They always have. They always will. But a lot of what is happening at these rallies is not just antisemitism. A lot of it is a generation that has only known Israel as a strong nation oppressing a weak people. They never knew a weak Israel. They never knew an Israel whose leaders sought peace, showed up to negotiate deals, who wanted something better. And I am not unsympathetic to the Israeli narrative here. I believe large parts of it. We have an episode coming soon on the many failures of the peace process. And the Israelis who say they did not have a partner, they are right. But that does not justify what Israel became, and there are consequences to what it has become. There is this Pew survey in 2022 that I find really telling. It found that 69 percent of Americans over age 65 had a favorable view of Israel, but among Americans between ages 18 and 29, young Americans, 56 percent had an unfavorable view. As it happens, American politics right now is dominated by people over 65, but it won’t be forever. And there are many of us who warned of this exact thing happening, who said, if you lose moral legitimacy, you will not have the world’s good will when you need it most, who said it is a problem for the Jewish state to not be seen, to not be a moral state. That it is a problem geopolitically, and it is a problem spiritually because for Jewish-Americans — and I am one — Israel isn’t simply a question of politics, it is the Jewish state. So what does what Israel is say about Judaism? What does Judaism say about it? This has been an almost exquisitely uncomfortable space. To believe Israel had become something indefensible on 10/6. To know that it needed defenders on 10/7, to know that antisemitism is real and every century seems to have its era of butchering the Jews. To believe deeply that Jewishness is about how we treat the stranger, is defined by the lessons of exile, and to see the Jewish state inflicting exile on so many. To value all lives and see so many of our one-time allies devaluing our own. Throughout these last few months, I’ve been extremely moved by the sermons of Rabbi Sharon Brous of Los Angeles’s IKAR synagogue. She has a book coming out called “The Amen Effect,” which you can and you should pre-order. I’ve read some of it. But I got to know her through these sermons, which did something very few people have been able to do, at least for me, which is to find a prophetic voice rooted in the Jewish tradition that can hold this complexity, these questions of Israel, both in critique and defense, of Jewishness, of liberalism, of antisemitism, of identity. And so I asked her to come on the show to try to talk through topics. And to be honest, I’m not all that comfortable talking about it all. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING] Rabbi Sharon Brous, welcome to the show.

So on Yom Kippur this year, Sept. 25, a few weeks before Hamas’s attack on Israel, you gave this searing sermon about Israel’s occupation and its increasingly right-wing government and what it is becoming. And I’m just going to play a clip of it here.

^ archive clip

SHARON BROUS ^: Telling the truth, very simply, is essential to healing. We must tell the truth about what is happening, where we are, and how we got here. I’m speaking right now, especially to those among us, who, like me, see in Israel a miraculous, national renaissance. We who celebrate the astonishing revival of the Hebrew language, who take great pride, not only in the safe haven, but also in the start-up nation, the flourishing of Jewish art and ideas and culture, the rebirth of academies of Torah learning, the bounty and the promise, the beauty and the bravery, even or especially in the face of grave threats, the realization of the Jewish national liberation project. All diagnosticians must take a serious effort to set aside our cognitive biases and see what is truly before us, rather than what our implicit bias orients us toward. But when we do, only then do we see that this government and its maximalist agenda are the natural outcomes of a growing extremism in Israeli society, manifesting most egregiously in more than a half century of occupation. 56 years of too many people allowing our own trauma and fear to justify the denial of basic rights, dignities, and dreams for millions of Palestinian people living under Israeli rule. Decades of justifying an unjustifiable status quo as the only reasonable response to the failures and missteps of Palestinian leadership and the violence of Palestinian extremists. Many of us have spent years trying not to look. We don’t know because we don’t want to know because the world is sometimes cruel and unfair to Jews, and yes, delivers to Israel disproportionate opprobrium among all the bad state actors. We don’t want to know because we don’t want to fuel antisemitism, because accepting the reality of Palestinian suffering under Israeli rule means accepting that the Jewish people can be not only victims, but also victimizers. ^ END CLIP ^

That’s not the kind of sermon you hear in a typical American synagogue. I mean, not now, of course, but not before Oct. 7 either, and particularly not on Yom Kippur. So why did you decide to make that your sermon?

sharon brous

Israel was the great dream that the Jewish people held through 2,000 years of exile and oppression and persecution and pogrom, and ultimately, genocide, that there could be a place in this world where the Jewish people could be safe and where our Jewish values could actually thrive not only behind the doors of the synagogue or the beit midrash, the study hall, or the schools, but actually, in the public square. And in many ways, the establishment of the state of Israel was miraculous for that reason. And it’s precisely because I think it matters so much that I’m so deeply worried about the ways that these growing illiberal trends, these growing undemocratic and un-Jewish trends in Israel are actually undermining that dream. And my call was, as an American rabbi and speaking to an American Jewish community, what is our responsibility? Are we to stay on the sidelines here and essentially just kind of keep our mouths shut? Or must we cry out in a time of moral crisis when our own families and friends and colleagues in Israel are essentially begging us to step into the fray? And obviously, I come out on the side that, yes, this is our central obligation. I said in the sermon that we have to fight against Jewish ideological extremism with as much passion and as much fervor as our grandparents fought for the establishment of the state in the first place after witnessing their entire families and communities decimated in Europe, that we needed to dedicate that much resource into actually fighting for the future of Israel as a democracy and as a just state.

You went on to talk about a ceremony in Israel earlier this year on their national remembrance day. Can you tell me about that, the stories you heard and what you saw then?

sharon brous

So for the past many years, Israeli Jews and Palestinian citizens of Israel and Palestinians living in the West Bank who have lost loved ones in their immediate family, they have formed an organization where they come together to share their grief. And for the past several years, they have met on Yom HaZikaron, on Israel’s day of remembrance. This is a really sad day in Israel. The whole country essentially stops in order to grieve those people who died since the founding of the state, whether serving in the I.D.F. or through acts of terror or other acts of violence. And the idea behind the joint commemoration is that if we are going to live as neighbors, we have to learn how to share our grief so that we can collectively build a shared society and a shared future. So one of the stories that was shared was by a man named Adel Abu Badawiya, who told about this terrible tragedy that had happened years ago. He lived in Jenin with his family, and the I.D.F. came into Jenin for some action. The children of the refugee camp where they lived all fled when the soldiers came in. And his little brother, Majid, was five years old at the time and was really terrified of the soldiers and ran away. And the family afterwards couldn’t find the little boy for many hours. And they were searching everywhere for him. And finally, they discovered his body in a refrigerator. In his terror, he had hidden there in order to escape these soldiers, and then he couldn’t get out. And he died in the refrigerator. It’s just a terribly tragic, awful, awful story. Among the Israeli speakers who spoke was a professor from Tel Aviv University, a man named Yuval Sapir, who talked about his sister, Tamar, who was a young newlywed in the ‘90s, when a Palestinian man blew up the bus that she was riding in downtown Tel Aviv. And many of us have memories and some of us even friends and loved ones who died in the era of bus bombings in the late ‘90s and the early 2000s. And he talked about the black hole that opened up when his beautiful sister died. And there are many other stories like this. And to think, these are the people in this conflict who have lost the most. And they are willing to stand together and to offer their stories as a testament not only to what they’ve lost, but to what they hope can be recovered, which is some kind of shared sense of humanity, even from the depths of the darkness. What happened this past year — and for several years, it’s been extremely controversial because many people in Israel feel that this is a sacred day to honor Jewish pain and not a time to be building bridges with Palestinian neighbors. But this past year, the protests were worse than they had been before. Thousands of people gathered together in Tel Aviv for this joint forum, and there were protesters who were outside, who were honking horns and screaming and protesting, doing everything they could, essentially, to drown out the words of the speakers. And this is particularly heartbreaking because what you have is Palestinians who are standing up in this forum and Israeli Jews standing up to share the stories of the deaths of their loved ones, and how their hearts are shattered and how, even still, they hold the hope of a better future. And their voices are being drowned out by these protesters who are so threatened by the idea of shared grief, that they really want to shut it down at all costs.

ezra klein

I took the center of this sermon as not being the critique or description of what was happening in Israel. I took it as being about what people in your congregation, and more broadly — and I’ll put myself in this category as well — were doing with it. And to quote you here, you said, many of us have spent years trying not to look. We don’t know because we don’t want to know. And that that approach to resolving this almost unbearable cognitive tension here, cognitive dissonance, simply looking away — I’m Jewish, I’m not Israeli. I don’t have traction on this. I’m not there. I’m not exposed to what they’re exposed to, and I don’t have a vote. I think that became very common. I’d like to hear you talk a bit about that — about watching that happen among people you knew cared about this issue, and how you were trying to speak to that.

sharon brous

First, I think that the fear of being an American Jew or a diaspora Jew and speaking out against Israeli policy or a rightward trend in Israeli politics or Jewish religious extremism is legitimately scary. We understand how antisemitism works in the world. And we understand the way that Israel does receive disproportionate opprobrium among all bad state actors in the world. And so it’s scary to speak out and to feel like we might be contributing to a dynamic that is fundamentally unfair and unfair to our family. So that’s the first piece, but even more than that, I think for many American Jews, the obvious response to Israel’s rightward shift over these years was just to disengage and invest as much as we could in the fight for racial justice, economic justice, climate justice, all of the things that we feel are central to our own self understanding and to our understanding of the kind of world we want to build, wherever we were. And so what we saw was a profound disengagement from Israel that essentially frayed the bonds between these two communities. This is a very small global Jewish community, and the two great population centers are Israel and the United States. And the rift that we’ve seen between the two communities has been real and profound and is a values rift. And that’s something that has been very worrisome over the course of the last couple of years. And I believe that this anti-democratic trend is not only anti-democratic, but it’s fundamentally un-Jewish, that the values that are core to our self-understanding as Jews in the world, which we derive both from Torah, from thousands of years of Jewish tradition and from our history, our history of persecution, of exile, of genocide, that we have formed a core set of values that are being undermined by those voices that come from the extreme in Israel. And even as those voices have become more dominant in the government, I do not believe that they are representative of the population of Israel. And the proof text to that is that I don’t know another country in the world that has had this kind of civil disobedience that stopped literally only because Oct. 7 happened, and it wasn’t safe for people to gather en masse in the streets. And everything kind of shifted in that moment. But I don’t know of any other place that we can point to where the people have risen up with such fervor week after week after week, for ten months straight, in order to say, you do not represent me. So I don’t think it’s fair for the world to characterize Israel as taking this dramatic, hardline, messianic, ethnonationalist turn, but rather, that there is a very significant, dangerous core that has risen in power and found its way into the Knesset, into the halls of power, and found its way into the street. And it’s our job to make sure that they don’t become representative of the population.

ezra klein

You called this anti-Jewish. And one question I want to ask because it’s a question that I’ve been wrestling with is whether that’s true. When you look at Israel, it’s the most observant, the most religious Israelis who are the most comfortable turning Israel into this entity that you fear, that I fear, that many of them see, the religion that we share, although understand differently, as a call for conquering biblical lands, as a demand for a kind of strength and sword. You’re a rabbi. There are, obviously, rabbis on the other side of this. What are you reading differently than these, to be fair to them, very learned rabbis there are seeing?

sharon brous

Yeah, this is a really important question. Every person of faith is engaging in an act of interpretation and choosing what texts to prioritize and how to read and interpret those texts. And my choice is to read that the first and most important thing that we learn about human beings in the beginning of the Book of Genesis is that all human beings are created B’tzelem Elohim, “in God’s own image.” And the way that our rabbis read that 2,000 years ago was that every single person has infinite worth, that all people are fundamentally equal, and that every single human life has something unique to contribute in this world. That is the core premise, the starting point for my faith and for my religious life. And I didn’t derive that from some 1990s feminist rereading of the tradition. That comes from the Book of Genesis, chapter 1. And then if you take a step back and look at the five Books of Moses, if you look at our core sacred literature, the Torah, you see that four of the five books of the Torah are dedicated to the experience of our people, the Israelites, walking from out of degradation and enslavement and barbarity and human cruelty toward the promised land on a quest to build a just society. And that story, that core narrative, lives at the heart of every Jewish ritual, every single Jewish holiday. It is at the heart of our prayer services. There’s not a morning, afternoon, or evening prayer where we don’t recall the exodus from Egypt. And it is delivered, not only as a narrative, but a narrative that is tied to specific moral action, which is, you are strangers in the land of Egypt. Do not oppress the stranger. You were strangers in the land of Egypt. You know the heart of the stranger. And you are strangers in the land of Egypt. You must love the stranger, protect the stranger. And that is the source of my Jewish faith. Maybe I am reading our tradition wrong, and those extremist, messianic figures deep in the West Bank who are teaching soldiers that they need to wipe out the enemy, maybe they’re right and I’m wrong. If that’s the case, I will have a very hard and honest conversation with the Holy One on the day of judgment.

ezra klein

Something you said a minute ago has to do with the experience of Jewishness, which is very important to the way I understand both the tradition and its teaching, that Jews are an exiled people. Jewishness is a religion formed out of displacement and oppression. And over the past decade, 15 years, after the collapse of the Israeli left, after the collapse of the peace process — and I don’t take anything away from how difficult and terrifying it is or was to be in Israel in this period and how confusing it is to know what to do next when peace offers were met with violence, but to settle into a kind of comfort with becoming the inflictor of displacement and oppression while still being the sole Jewish state, it made me wonder a lot about what this all meant. If you were to say what makes, I think, Jewish people or Jewish thinking exceptional, I think it had a lot to do with those lessons of exile that’s so core to the tradition. And then when it came to it, when fear and strength collided with one another, they didn’t seem to make us act any differently than anyone else through history would have.

sharon brous

Well, I think there are two great lessons from history. One is eventually, in essentially any historical context, at some point, live long enough in a place, and eventually, the Jews will be excommunicated, exiled, pogroms, persecuted, or genocided. And forgive me, I mean, not to grossly oversimplify Jewish history, but there are trend lines that we have to notice here. So what we learned from that, on one hand, the Torah explicitly demands that we learn from that experience in Mizraim in Egypt. You know what it’s like to be the oppressed minority. That is built into your self-understanding. Bring that with you wherever you go, whether that’s to Los Angeles or to Brooklyn or to Paris or to Tel Aviv. So that’s one side of the message. The other side is, if I am not for myself, who will be for me? The fact that Jews have suffered so profoundly, historically, in so many places, across so much time, has taught our people that the world is a hostile place that doesn’t actually care about Jewish life. Sometimes that hatred of Jews will be overt. Sometimes it will be latent. Eventually, it almost always surfaces. And there’s a very deep, psychic trauma that comes from holding that history. I can frame the tension in another way, which is, there is an entrenched Jewish mentality that comes from the Book of Numbers [HEBREW] that we are a people that dwells alone in a part that the world does not understand us and never really will, fundamentally. And therefore we need to do what needs to be done. That’s also a lesson from history. Or on the other side, the lesson of [HEBREW]— it’s not good for a person or for a people to be alone in the world. And our work in the world is to be bound up in the bonds of life. And that’s another tension that I think appears in the Jewish community. Do we see ourselves as fundamentally alone, and therefore, primarily responsible for taking care of ourselves? Do we see ourselves as fundamentally a part of humanity, and therefore, see ourselves as responsible for building a better world for everyone? And what happens when those two values seem to be in conflict with one another? [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

So that is where and I think it feels weird even to try to inhabit that space now, but that is where your sermon was, where I think a lot of us were prior to Oct. 7. Then push forward a few weeks. Hamas attacks and kills 1,200 people in Israel, takes hundreds more hostage. There are social media videos of the most astonishingly traumatic executions of Jewish people that I think any of us have seen in modernity. And there’s also, at the same time, this explosion of rationalization of it, of justification for it. And this is where I began paying attention to your sermons in this period, because somebody sent me one of yours, that talked about what you call the existential loneliness of the Jew in that moment. So what was that loneliness?

sharon brous

As you said, the violence of Oct. 7 was absolutely staggering. And I remember thinking in those early days, could we fathom another civilian population anywhere in the world of any other nation in the world in which massacres at that scale would lead not to some kind of condemnation, but instead, to celebration in the street? And I actually don’t believe that we can fathom such a thing. And I think that part of the loneliness, especially for those of us on the left, we felt like we were part of an anti-racist movement. We felt we were part of a movement working toward a just society. And obviously, in those spaces, any kind of atrocity committed against a civilian would be outright condemned. And I think what it has awakened in many American Jews is a very painful acknowledgment that we thought we were part of a movement. We thought we were part of a world view that now it’s clear doesn’t think that we are part of it. And that’s very, very painful. And that’s really something new for this population.

ezra klein

And it’s actually something you say in that sermon, that sometimes it can be easy to miss who was there because it was so shocking who wasn’t. For everything we’ve been talking about, I think the answer to this community of Jews in America who are liberal, who want Israel to be more liberal, who think there are other ways forward, has always been — and I mean, this is a big split, both generationally and geographically in Judaism, you’re naive. You don’t live here. You don’t know what it’s like. You don’t know what these people are like. You are naive. The world you are painting would be nice. It is not possible. And you would hear it often from older Jews. You did not live through what we lived through. You think you are safe. You are not. You’re naive. We have to be strong. We have to, at times, be brutal, because if we are not, this will come back, and it will kill us. And I do think one reckoning, one very difficult reckoning I’ve seen a lot of people going through is, was I naive? Were these other voices right?

sharon brous

I have been asking myself that question from the moment that I heard what was going on in Israel on Shabbat morning, Oct. 7. And here’s how I have come to understand it. Many of the people who have been critical of me as a progressive rabbinic voice in America, of me and my colleagues, accused us, for years, of downplaying an antisemitism that they believed was always a part of movement spaces and a part of the broader population. And on some level, they were right. I really wanted to believe that there’s not a Nazi hiding under every rock. And so I saw hints of really problematic ideology hovering under the surface, and I fought very hard to believe that those were only small exceptions and not reflective of a bigger, looming catastrophe. And also, I was right. And we were right. Because given the ever present reality of that latent antisemitism previous to Oct. 7 latent, the only thing that we could do is reinvest in relationships and double down on the work and recommit ourselves to building a shared future there and here that is a just future for everyone.

ezra klein

Your next sermon was built around a reading of the story of Avraham and Lot. Tell me that story and what you took from it.

sharon brous

This is the story that comes in the Book of Genesis when Avraham has established himself in the land. And he came with his nephew, Lot, and with his wife, Sarah. And Avraham we meet him many times in the course of this Torah portion. It’s called Lech Lecha. And we meet him as a husband, as a father, as a businessman, but once his nephew, Lot, is kidnapped — he is abducted in the war between the kings — all of the sudden, Avram’s — he’s called Avram at that time. Avram’s identity shifts. He’s no longer just a husband, a son, a warrior. He’s now a Hebrew. And so the question is, what does it mean to be a Hebrew? And what does it mean for a moment in time to shift our own self understanding? I’m looking at Genesis 14:13, Avram Ha’Ivri, Avram the Hebrew. The way that I read it this year in light of Oct. 7 is that there are certain wounds to the spirit that are so profound that they actually prompt a fundamental change in our identity. That once this wound hits, we see ourselves differently than we did before, a shift in our own self understanding. And I see this. I’ve seen this in many American Jews, who describe that after Oct. 7, they understand themselves differently. There are people who have never stepped foot in a synagogue and who would never take their family vacation to Israel, who, all of a sudden, say us and we when they’re talking about what happened on Oct. 7 and afterwards, who are talking about being a part of this people in a way that even takes them by surprise. We have been changed by this moment. And my argument in that sermon was that there are two sides to this new identity. There certainly were for Avram. One side is he realizes how profoundly attached he actually is to his family. And for the sake of the story, let me remind us that Avram and Lot are a little bit estranged from each other. And even still, his estranged family being taken captive awakened something in him that helped him understand that he was responsible, he was the one who was responsible for getting Lot back from captivity, which he ultimately does. He’s able to bring Lot and all the other captives back. And there’s another element to the identity of the Ivri. So right after Lot returns home, the text says [HEBREW]. God says to Avraham in Genesis chapter 15, verse 1, don’t be afraid, Avram. And it’s kind of a funny thing for the Torah to be saying, don’t be afraid, because what would he be afraid of? He’d just won the war. The war is over. He’s back in peacetime now. His nephew is home safely. Why would he be afraid? And the rabbis say — and this is 2,000 years ago — he was afraid because maybe there was one righteous innocent among the people that he killed in order to get his captive nephew home. And so what I understand about the identity of the Hebrew, to be an Ivri, is to understand the depth of connection, obligation, responsibility, that we have to our family, even our estranged family, and at the same time, to live with the constant awareness that our actions could cause great harm to others. And our work in the world as descendants of Avraham is to do everything in our power to minimize harm to other people. And that felt like the call of this moment for me.

Well, what I hear in that is these two very deep sides of not just Judaism, but many traditions and many groups, which is, for lack of a better term, the tribal and the ethical having very deep, visceral commitments to your own kin, however you define that, and how you balance that, then, with an ethical, a creedal, a spiritual code that, in theory, is binding you to each other. And I guess as a question of practice, not just a question of teaching, how do you understand doing that?

sharon brous

It’s very hard to hold both of these truths at once. And when we’re in trauma and in grief, and we are grieving now, we are in avelut. We are in a time of mourning, it’s really important that we take care of our hearts. And not all of the work can be done at once. And so I fully understand a kind of temporary retreat into the tribal and away from the universal for the moment. The danger is staying in the tribal. The research on this is quite extraordinary because it shows that the deeper our tribal connections, the weaker our connections to those outside our tribe. And what I’m actually asking of myself and of us is that we strengthen our tribal attachment at the same time that we strengthen our universal attachment. And it’s extremely challenging to do it. And so I have just taken it upon myself these last five weeks to continue to remind our Jewish community that we can be tribal in this moment. We can and we must engage in the side of the identity of the Hebrew that takes care of other Hebrews right now. That’s part of what it means to care for your family. And it can never end there because ultimately, the problem of the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small. And we know the pain of the worlds drawing the circle of their family small enough that it excludes us. We must not exclude others ultimately.

ezra klein

This reminds me of one of the threads from the sermon you gave a week after Oct. 7 about trying to walk this line. Just an overwhelming feeling for many Jewish people in that moment was deep sense of fear and isolation, and that if the world is this dangerous, then I have to act accordingly. And you said that we who have been excluded by the narrow scope of others’ moral concern must not narrow the scope of our moral concern to exclude others. And you went on to say, just because others have lost their damn minds, we must not lose our damn minds. Tell me about walking that tightrope for you.

We know what loneliness and isolation does to the human heart. We know, just on an individual basis — and I’m very invested in the work and thinking of Dr. Vivek Murthy right now about loneliness. We understand now what loneliness does to the spirit and to the body of a person experiencing it. Loneliness kills us. It’s a sickness in us. And it hurts our hearts physically and spiritually. It makes us retreat. It makes us behave badly. Now imagine that on a collective scale. My concern is that right now, the existential loneliness, combined with the utter anguish and shock of the atrocities that were committed, combined with the fear that comes from the scrawl on my neighbor congregant’s garage that says, “Feed the Jews to the pigs.” When we encounter this kind of overt antisemitism, and so we’re now dealing not only with loneliness, but also with a very real fear for our own safety and security, my fear is that we lead not with our best moral thinking. When we experience how incredibly painful it is to see that our own lives and our family’s lives do not matter to many, many people in the world, that many people, including those who we thought were our allies and our friends, do not shed a tear when our elders are abducted and taken into captivity, what we must do, in addition to fighting to get all of those who are captive home immediately, but what we must do is heart work. We have to make sure that we don’t close our hearts. Because there are also many, many people who don’t think that Palestinian lives are worth anything and who don’t shed a tear when Palestinian children die. And so how can we, who desperately cry out for the world to take Jewish suffering seriously, not also have our own hearts break when Palestinians are suffering? It makes no sense. And so we must also make sure that we extend our circle of care and concern to include the innocence on the other side of that border, who really have nothing to do with this conflict and whose lives are in absolute misery right now. And I know how hard it is to do that at the same time because there are very few people who are actually shedding tears when both Israeli Jews and Palestinians are dying. There are very few people who are doing that. And it feels to me, that is the essential struggle of this time, because I don’t frankly want to hear from the people who are in the streets, who are shouting about decolonizing Palestine, who do not shed a tear when Vivian Silver, a 74-year-old warrior for peace, who dedicated her life to peace, is murdered by Hamas. If your heart doesn’t break for Vivian Silver, then don’t tell me what you think my heart should be breaking for. And the same is true on the other side, for the people who are absolutely devastated by losses to Jews, but then feel it’s offensive to even report on the Palestinian children who are dying in Gaza. I’m sorry, but we have lost our moral center. What we have to do is expand our scope of moral concern to find the humanity in one another again. That is the call of our time. [MUSIC PLAYING]

You talked about going to Israel shortly after the attacks and bearing what you called “sacred witness.” What did that term mean for you?

sharon brous

I went to Israel two weeks after the massacres. And I went because I had a planned trip. My niece became bat mitzvah. They live outside of Tel Aviv. It was a very scary and hard time and is for their family. And my presence, it felt, would really matter to them in that time. And I went because I wanted to see and to hear and to stretch open my heart to the depths of the horror of this reality so that I could come home and share with my community what I had experienced. The survivors from a kibbutz at the border called Kfar Aza, most of them were relocated to a kibbutz outside of Tel Aviv because about 40 percent of Kfar Aza, this very peaceful kibbutz at the border, was burned to the ground. And many, many people died, and many were abducted. And so I went to this kibbutz, and I walked around the place in order to speak with and meet with survivors, people who had themselves barely made it out alive. And almost every person there had lost at least one immediate family member. And many had family members who were in Gaza abducted. And as I speak about in the sermon, I was toured around this site by two guides, who showed me these picnic blankets surrounded by maybe 10 or so people sitting in plastic chairs. And one of the guides said, this is shiva. And then the other guide corrected him and said shivot — this is many shivas happening all at once. And there were about 100 shivas. A shiva is a house of mourning. It’s when after a loved one dies, friends and family come over to sit and tell stories and comfort the bereaved. And in this case, from this community, there were hundreds of people experiencing the death of immediate loved ones all at once. I felt, when I walked around this kibbutz, that I was in a D.P. camp after the Holocaust. The depth of human suffering, people walking around with bandages around their heads, bandages through their hands because many of them had been locked in the safe room for up to 35 hours, waiting for the I.D.F. to come and rescue them, and Hamas had shot through the doors. And so many of them had their hands shattered. Just looking at the depth of sorrow and human suffering was profoundly humbling. And I felt it was important for me to see it and experience it, and to have my heart broken again and again by hearing stories that people were sharing so that I could share back here that perspective with my community.

ezra klein

This felt to me like the connecting thread of these three sermons, going back to the one about Israel’s government before the Hamas attacks. That in each of them, I saw, at its core, an argument about the importance, at least right now, as a political act of simply bearing witness of not just looking, but seeing, of not turning away, not turning away from what was really happening in Israel, not turning away from what was really happening in the antisemitism and cruelty of the response many had to Hamas’s attacks, of then not looking away from how complex this was all going to be and is to hold and to navigate. And so I wanted to ask you about that, about that idea of bearing witness of seeing, of holding, as a political and spiritual practice.

sharon brous

So there is a Mishnah, an ancient rabbinic text in the code of law that was codified 2,000 years ago, that tells the story of what would happen when the people used to go up to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. And imagine Mecca, like hundreds of thousands of people coming at once on a kind of sacred pilgrimage to Jerusalem. They would ascend the steps to the Temple Mount, and then they would go through this arched entryway. And they would turn to the right, and they would circle around the perimeter of this courtyard. And then they would exit essentially right where they had come in. Except, the Mishnah says, for someone who’s broken hearted. That person would go up to Jerusalem. They would ascend the steps, walk through the arched entryway, but they would turn to the left. And every single person who would pass them coming from the right would have to stop and ask this simple question, [HEBREW], what happened to you? And then the person would say, I’m brokenhearted. My loved one just died. I’m worried sick about my kid. I found a lump. And the people who are walking from right to left would have to stop and offer a blessing before they could continue on their pilgrimage. And I just want to think about how profound the insight is in this ancient ritual because if you spend your whole life dreaming of going up on this sacred pilgrimage to the holiest site, the holiest place on the holiest days, and doing your circle around the courtyard, the last thing in the world you want to do is stop and ask the poor guy who’s coming toward you, are you OK? What’s your story? What’s going on with you? And yet central to your religious obligation, in fact, the only religious obligation you have that day, is precisely to see this other person in their suffering, to ask them what their story is, and then to give them a blessing. And if you’re broken, shattered, the last thing you want to do is show up in this space with all of these people and go against the current in such a public and visible way. And yet, you’re obligated to do that. And so I think the rabbis kind of captured this very sacred and profound, psychological and spiritual tool for us, which is to say when we are suffering and when we’re hurting, we need to be seen by other people. We need somebody to say, tell me about your pain. Help me understand what’s going on for you. And we need to be blessed. And that’s why the loneliness of this moment feels so profound for so many Jews because we feel like, wait, we often ask people, tell me about your pain. Tell me about your suffering. How can I be a good ally? How can I stand with you in solidarity? Why aren’t people asking us? And it’s a reminder for us that we have to reinforce our commitment to living in a world in which we can see each other in our pain. And when we’re walking from right to left, because we’re OK that day, not to turn our eyes away and our hearts away from the poor person who’s walking toward us who’s broken that day. Otherwise, our humanity is lost to us. And it doesn’t only hurt the person who’s broken. It hurts the whole society. It, frankly, hurts our democracy. It endangers our democracy when we’re unable to actually engage one another’s pain because we feel that our cause is so righteous. Our work is so holy, so important that we’re going to keep circling from the right, even though there are all these people who are quietly walking in the other direction, saying, please, please see me. I’m hurting right now, and I need you to help me in this moment of my pain. I need you to help me by bearing sacred witness to my heartache in this moment.

ezra klein

That’s very beautiful. And then always our final question, what are three books you would recommend to the audience?

sharon brous

The first is Abraham Joshua Heschel’s seminal work, “The Prophets,” which, for me, in the course of my rabbinate was an absolutely transformative book to help me understand not only our prophetic tradition, but really what’s demanded of us in a time of moral crisis. And it’s a book that I think about literally every day. The second is John O’Donohue book, “To Bless the Space Between Us.” It is just sublime and beautiful and enchanting and reminds me of my own humanity and of other peoples of our ability to bless each other with love. And he says we’ve fallen out of belonging. What does it mean to create a new reality in which we really understand how much we belong to one another? And the third, I would say, is a novel written by Yaa Gyasi, “Homegoing,” which I really think is one of the best novels I’ve ever read. It is this epic story of generations, of the descendants of two sisters from Ghana, the impact of violence and enslavement and multigenerational trauma. And it’s really also a story of hope and survival, and I’ve read it many times. And each time, I have this sense I’m so honored to be turning these pages right now and taking in this story. So those are my three today. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Thank you, Ezra.

288,288,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/nyregion/noa-tishby-israel-antisemitism.html,"The overarching theme of her message is this: When people reject Zionism, suggesting that Israel does not have the right to exist as a Jewish state, it is code for hatred of Jews themselves. “When a massacre occurs that is more barbaric than the world had seen in generations, people actually say, ‘Well, but Israel kind of deserves that,’” Ms. Tishby said. “Anti-Zionism is antisemitism.”

That concept — that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are equivalent — is at the heart of a generations-long argument. It is a position endorsed by many mainstream organizations and rejected by others, including many progressive Jews. Critics say that tying a disavowal of Zionism to antisemitism discourages critical discourse about Israeli policy.

“My overarching critique of Noa is that she is part of an effort that is led by the Israeli government to conflate all strident criticism of Israeli governmental policy with antisemitism,” said Simone Zimmerman, a writer and activist who helped create “If Not Now,” a movement of American Jews who are critical of the Israeli government for its policies toward Palestinians.

Ms. Tishby, who said she was fired by the Israeli government after criticizing the Netanyahu administration, says she welcomes the debate. But she does not apologize for her belief that her homeland has a right to defend itself, even now, when Israel is facing intense criticism for its barrage on areas of Gaza populated both by civilians and Hamas.

“Three weeks ago, Israel was brutally attacked by savages who are out to destroy her,” she said. “If Mexico would have done the same thing to the United States, nobody would have told the U.S. three weeks in ‘restrain yourself.’ Israel is doing the best it can in an impossible situation.”

She demurs only when she is asked if she stands behind Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his handling of the war. “I don’t want to talk about that,” she said.

In social media videos and in interviews, Ms. Tishby speaks with the ease of a veteran broadcast anchor, the self-certainty of a politician who has honed her talking points and the passion of an activist who is willing to reveal her emotions but not give in to them.

Her objective, she said, is to lift the morale of Jewish people around the world and to try to reach those on the political left who believe the killing of 1,400 Israelis and kidnapping of 240 more by Hamas was an act of Palestinian resistance. “The progressive left has been played,” she said.

In an appearance on Fox last week with Sean Hannity, Ms. Tishby noted that Hamas has broken cease-fires in the past, and she emphasized the threat posed by Iran, a supporter of Hamas. “The human rights that you have in Iran are the human rights that you are going to have in the West” if Hamas is not removed from power, she said. “Israel is fighting the West’s war.”

And in an Instagram video post that included footage of the plane that crashed into the World Trade Center, Ms. Tishby spoke to the camera. “Imagine if within days of the Al Qaeda attack on 9/11,” she said, “a group of students on American campuses were holding rallies in support of that terror attack.” She added: “That is exactly what is happening on campuses in America right now.”

To plenty of Jewish people, Ms. Tishby is an inspiration — a frontline general in a messaging war, providing supporters of Israel with an insider understanding of its history and answers to accusations made about a country they cherish — all in shareable Instagram posts. “She is a pro-Israel influencer on a platform that is notoriously hostile to Israel,” said Representative Ritchie Torres, a Democrat from New York and a close friend. “The common refrain that I’ve heard from the Jewish community is, ‘We’re feeling alone and we’re feeling scared, and it’s voices like Noa Tishby’s that make us feel less alone and scared.’”

Before the war, Ms. Tishby was relatively unknown in the United States. But for decades, “she was a household name in Israel,” said her friend Gideon Raff, who created the Israeli television series “Prisoners of War” and was an executive producer of “Homeland,” the Showtime series based on it.

Ms. Tishby was born in Tel Aviv and raised in a politically active, progressive family. She served in the Israel Defense Forces, in what might be thought of as the Israeli U.S.O. She traveled from “the Golan Heights to Hebron to the Gaza Strip,” she wrote in her book, singing cover tunes and performing sketches for her fellow soldiers.

While still in the army, she was cast in a television drama as Dafna Maor, a designer hired to bring youth and relevance to a fashion company. The show, named “Ramat Aviv Gimmel,” for an affluent suburb of Tel Aviv, was a sensation."
289,289,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/world/middleeast/israeli-troops-encircle-gaza-city.html,"Top Israeli officials have said their forces are going out of their way to prevent civilian deaths, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also delivered an unapologetic defense of the aerial campaign.

On Thursday evening, he said that Israel's ground forces were “already beyond the outskirts of Gaza City.”

“We are making progress,” Mr. Netanyahu wrote on social media. “Nothing will stop us.”

The Israeli military’s spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said on Thursday night that “Israeli soldiers have completed the encirclement of the city of Gaza, the center of the Hamas terror organization.”

The United Nations General Assembly, aid organizations and a large number of countries have urged a cease-fire, but the Biden administration has resisted making a similar call, instead pressing only for a humanitarian pause. American and Israeli officials have said a cease-fire would allow Hamas to regroup, and Admiral Hagari on Thursday added, “The concept of a cease-fire is not currently on the table at all.”

Israel said its airstrikes were targeting Hamas militants responsible for the Oct. 7 attacks that killed 1,400 Israelis. Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, has retreated into a network of tunnels that course through the sandy soils underneath Gaza neighborhoods. The Israeli military singled out Ibrahim Biari, a commander it described as a central figure in the Oct. 7 attacks, and said that he and “a large number of terrorists who were with him were killed” in one Jabaliya strike. A Hamas spokesman denied that any of its commanders had been in the area.

Like the prime minister, Israeli officials have defended their conduct of the war. On Thursday, a spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lior Haiat, accused Hamas of using Gazans as human shields. He said that “the entire responsibility lies on the terrorists of Hamas.”

“No other country in the world is making the same effort as Israel to prevent civilian casualties,” he said.

The Gazan interior ministry said that another strike on Thursday morning in the same neighborhood hit a school run by UNRWA, the United Nations agency that aids Palestinians, and that several people were injured.

Satellite images showed the scale of destruction of Tuesday’s airstrike in Jabaliya. All buildings in an approximate area of at least 2,500 square meters, or 27,000 square feet, were completely flattened, with more surrounding buildings heavily damaged."
290,290,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/us/politics/house-aid-bill-israel.html,"A divided House on Thursday passed a Republican-written bill that would tie $14.3 billion in military aid for Israel to domestic spending cuts and provide no money for Ukraine, defying President Biden and dooming its chances in the Senate.

Republicans pushed through the measure on a mostly party-line vote of 226 to 196. That’s rare for an Israel aid package, which would normally enjoy broad bipartisan support.

All but a dozen Democrats opposed the legislation, put forward by the newly elected Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, because it would slash President Biden’s plan to bolster the Internal Revenue Service’s tax collection efforts. This sets up a showdown in the Senate, where members of both parties favor a bill that would include aid to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan without the I.R.S. cuts.

Mr. Biden has requested such a package, totaling $105 billion, and White House officials said on Tuesday that he would veto the House bill because it was limited to Israel and contained “partisan poison pill offsets.”

Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said in a speech ahead of the House vote on Thursday that the Senate would not take up the House-passed proposal at all, and would instead craft its own bipartisan bill containing aid for Israel and Ukraine, and humanitarian aid to Gaza.

The Senate could then try and force its version of the legislation on the House — and see which chamber blinks first. The resulting dispute could extend for weeks, delaying the aid."
291,291,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/world/middleeast/israel-bomb-jabaliya.html,"Israel used at least two 2,000-pound bombs during an airstrike on Tuesday on Jabaliya, a dense area just north of Gaza City, according to experts and an analysis conducted by The New York Times of satellite images, photos and videos.

Hospital officials said that dozens of civilians were killed and hundreds wounded in the strike. Israel said it was targeting a Hamas commander and fighters, as well as the network of underground tunnels used by Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, to hide weapons and fighters.

Israel’s use of such bombs, the second largest type in its arsenal, is not uncommon, and the size is generally the largest that most militaries use on a regular basis. They can be used to target underground infrastructure, but their deployment in a dense and heavily populated area like Jabaliya has raised questions of proportionality — whether Israel’s intended targets justify the civilian death toll and destruction its strikes cause.

The evidence and analysis show that the Israeli military dropped at least two 2,000-pound bombs on the site. Two impact craters are about 40 feet wide — dimensions consistent with underground explosions that this type of weapon would produce in light, sandy soil, according to a 2016 technical study by Armament Research Services, a munitions research consultancy."
292,292,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/us/us-family-gaza-escape-israel-war.html,"“I can’t wait to be home and just heal and hold my daughter in my arms and tell her how proud I am of her because I am so proud of her,” Lena said at the time. “And I want to be there to see her graduate, to her being a bride and seeing her children.”

In the mornings, out of fuel for the stove, they “brewed” Nescafe in cold water “to make you feel like you’re having coffee,” Lena said. She instructed the children to conserve drinking water by taking tiny sips, and only if they felt like they were dying of thirst. They almost never showered.

“It got to the point where you had everything, and then you had nothing,” Sireen, 36, one of her daughters, said.

Compared with many people in Gaza, they knew they were lucky. Hospitals were under siege, and food and water were growing scarce. All around her, Lena said, she saw people paying “the price of this sick war.” On her drives to and from the border, Lena saw wounded families and children with severe burns. Sometimes, she said, she saw children sleeping on the street and eating scraps of food from the ground.

“My heart cries 24/7,” she texted in late October.

At least the Beseisos had a roof over their heads. They could borrow their downstairs neighbor’s stove. They had some phone signal through Lena’s cell service. Thanks in part to the neighbor’s reserves of dried beans and rice, they never ran out of water or food, even if it was never quite enough."
293,293,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/us/politics/nikki-haley-tiktok-ban.html,"Nikki Haley ratcheted up her calls this week for the U.S. government to ban TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform, after some users, weighing in on the war between Israel and Hamas, promoted “Letter to America,” a text written by Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Ms. Haley, a Republican presidential contender and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President Donald J. Trump, argued that the document was another example of foreign adversaries using social media to spread anti-American propaganda to young people.

“That’s why you have to ban TikTok,” Ms. Haley said at a town hall in Newton, Iowa, on Friday. “Nepal just came out yesterday, and they’re banning it because they see what’s happening in their country. India did it. Why are we the last ones to do it?”

In bin Laden’s letter, the mastermind of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, which killed nearly 3,000 people, defended the terrorists’ actions. He wrote that American taxpayers had been complicit in harming Muslims in the Middle East, including destroying Palestinian homes. He also said that Americans were “servants” to Jews, who controlled the country’s economy and media. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. military and intelligence operatives in 2011.

In a statement on X, TikTok responded to Ms. Haley’s calls for a ban — which she also posted on social media Thursday — by saying that the circulation of bin Laden’s letter violated the platform’s rules banning support for terrorism and that it was policing related content accordingly.

“We are proactively and aggressively removing this content and investigating how it got onto our platform,” the company said. “The number of videos on TikTok is small and reports of it trending on our platform are inaccurate.”

A spokesman for the company told The New York Times on Thursday that most of the views of the videos came after news organizations wrote about them, and that the letter had also “appeared across multiple platforms and the media.”

Ms. Haley’s crusade against TikTok has become a flashpoint in the Republican presidential race, coinciding with her rise in the polls. Mr. Trump, her former boss, continues to be the overwhelming front-runner, but Ms. Haley, a former South Carolina governor, is trying to overtake Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida for second place.

At the Republican debate last week in Miami, she clashed with Vivek Ramaswamy, the biotech entrepreneur, over calls for a TikTok ban. He mentioned that her daughter had an account on the platform, drawing Ms. Haley’s ire and leading her to call Mr. Ramaswamy “scum.”

Ms. Haley has knocked Mr. Ramaswamy for joining TikTok after he had previously referred to the app as “digital fentanyl.” In the days following the debate, she has contended that social media platforms should better police certain users and content, prompting criticism from some of her rivals. Her call on Tuesday for social media companies to verify the identity of users and to bar people from posting anonymously was panned by Mr. DeSantis, Mr. Ramaswamy and others as unconstitutional and a threat to free speech.

“You know who were anonymous writers back in the day?” Mr. DeSantis wrote on X. “Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison when they wrote the Federalist Papers.”

Ms. Haley told CNBC a day later that her comments were directed at foreign adversaries, not Americans.

At town halls for her campaign in Iowa on Thursday and Friday, Ms. Haley continued to press on TikTok and brought up the letter by bin Laden.

“Now you have members of our younger generation, they’re saying now they understand why he did it. That’s disgusting,” she said at a town hall in Newton on Friday. “That’s not America doing that. That’s China doing that.”

Ms. Haley has assailed what she calls “foreign infiltration” into American society by hostile governments. She has particularly focused on propaganda and disinformation, which she says is being distributed by China, Russia and Iran to young Americans through TikTok and other social media platforms. She has also argued that young Americans are more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause because of “pro-Hamas videos on TikTok.”

She has also hammered the rise of Chinese investment in communities across the country, particularly the acquisition of farmland and agricultural technology — an acute anxiety in rural states like Iowa.

Linda Schroeder, of Dubuque, said Ms. Haley’s focus on the issue is what put the candidate over the top as her choice.

“Why are we allowing it? For them to be here,” Ms. Schroeder said after hearing from Ms. Haley. “I grew up with 14 other siblings on a farm, and we still have the farm, and we’ll keep it.”"
294,294,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/opinion/hamas-public-pressure-israel-war.html,"In the summer of 2008, I helped raid a hospital. As I’ve written before, I was deployed as a JAG officer (an Army lawyer) with the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment in Diyala Province, Iraq. Diyala was in the midst of a wave of suicide bombings, many of them carried out by women, that was brutal beyond words. And the vast majority in our area of operations weren’t aimed at American troops. We could be quite hard to hit. Instead, suicide bombers blew up cafes, medical clinics and weddings. Sometimes they’d “double tap.” One bomber would detonate, then as medical help arrived, a second bomber would kill aid workers and desperate family members who were searching for survivors.

In the midst of this nightmare, we received intelligence that one of the leaders of the suicide bombing cell was operating out of a nearby hospital. As the unit JAG officer, I was asked to review the request to send elements of a cavalry troop to invade the building and search it room by room. I not only approved the search, I participated. I didn’t lead it. No combat unit wants its lawyer to lead a potentially dangerous mission, but I was inside as our troopers searched every square inch of the building.

Our target wasn’t there. The entire search was anticlimactic and barely memorable compared to countless other incidents during my deployment. We guarded the exits, announced ourselves, entered peacefully and conducted a deliberate, orderly and fruitless search. Except for the fact that we were bristling with weapons, it was all quite quiet and calm.

At the time I was both disappointed and — to be perfectly honest — a bit relieved. We desperately wanted to kill or capture the man who was responsible for so much death and destruction, but the thought of a firefight in the middle of a hospital full of sick and wounded civilians filled me with dread."

The rise in antisemitism since the outbreak of war in the Middle East has ignited a clash between Wall Street donors and universities, and divided some workplaces. Now, the pressure is building on social media platforms, particularly Elon Musk’s X and TikTok, with advertisers, celebrities and influencers pulling spending and confronting executives about the proliferation of hate speech.

The backlash against Musk is spreading. IBM pulled about $1 million in ad spending from X after Media Matters for America, a left-wing advocacy group, showed that ads were appearing “next to content that touts Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party.” Other big brands, including Apple and Oracle, were also appearing next to the content. And a major Tesla shareholder said Musk’s behavior was damaging the carmaker’s brand.

Musk’s own missives aren’t helping. He posted to X his support for white nationalist conspiracy theories that Jewish communities were spreading hatred. Musk was already embroiled in a fight with the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group, that says the rise of antisemitic content has risen more sharply on X than on rival platforms.

The latest controversy will renew questions about the authority of X’s C.E.O., Linda Yaccarino. She said on Thursday that the company had “been extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination.” (That prompted some to ask if she had addressed the matter with Musk.)"

The American Civil Liberties Union and Palestine Legal filed a federal lawsuit Thursday claiming that Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida education officials violated the First Amendment when they ordered the removal of support for Students for Justice in Palestine, a campus activist group.

The order affected the group’s chapters at the University of Florida and the University of South Florida.

What the Lawsuit Says

The order, which hasn’t been carried out, has already cast a “significant chill” on the activities of the University of Florida’s chapter, “causing its Board and members to think twice before organizing and advocating for Palestine,” the lawsuit stated.

The lawsuit also contends that the order by Florida to deactivate its chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine is based on claims about the national organization and not the local chapters.

In addition to Governor DeSantis, the lawsuit named as defendants Ray Rodrigues, chancellor of the State University System of Florida; Ben Sasse, the University of Florida’s president; and board members of the system and university.

A spokesman for the University of Florida said that it did not comment on pending litigation but in an earlier statement said that the university had not removed any student organizations.

Jeremy T. Redfern, a spokesman for Mr. DeSantis, said, “Groups that claim to be part of a foreign terrorist movement have no place on our university campuses.”

Why Florida Moved to Ban the Group

Two weeks after the Hamas attack in Israel, Mr. Rodrigues, who oversees the state’s 12 public universities, wrote to their presidents that the group’s chapters must be “deactivated,” meaning they could no longer access university space or funding.

The decision, which Mr. Rodrigues said was based on consultation with Governor DeSantis, was not based on anything the local chapters said or did but rather on what the letter described as the national organization’s “support of terrorism.”

The national group had released a “Day of Resistance” tool kit, describing the Hamas attack as “the resistance” and stating that “Palestinian students in exile are PART of this movement, not in solidarity with this movement.”

Mr. Rodrigues’s letter stated that providing material support to foreign terrorist organizations was a felony under Florida law.

Florida Isn’t the Only Place Cracking Down

Florida’s move against the Students for Justice in Palestine chapters comes amid a broader crackdown on the student group.

On Oct. 25, two pro-Israel groups, the Anti-Defamation League and the Brandeis Center, a Jewish advocacy nonprofit, wrote to nearly 200 university presidents urging them to investigate their chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine.

In the days that followed, Brandeis University — which is not affiliated with the Brandeis Center — announced it would no longer recognize the chapter because the national group “openly supports Hamas.” Columbia and George Washington University have also suspended their chapters.

While free-expression groups decried the actions, the First Amendment was not in play because those universities, unlike the University of Florida, are private.

The Free Speech Issues

Jonathan Friedman, a director at PEN America, a free-expression group, said that he had concerns about the crackdowns on the group, but that the Florida case was a clear-cut violation of the First Amendment. The statute cited by Mr. Rodrigues applies to economic or other tangible support to a terrorist organization, not to acts of speech.

“Rhetorical support is not material support,” he said.

At a Florida Board of Governors meeting on Nov. 9, Mr. Rodrigues acknowledged that there could be legal issues with banning the chapters.

Still, Mr. Rodrigues said that the board was seeking its own legal counsel, and that he was working with the two universities to seek “affirmation” from their Students for Justice in Palestine chapters that they rejected violence, were not part of Hamas and would follow the law.

Those demands are also illegal, Hina Shamsi, the director of the A.C.L.U.’s National Security Project, said.

“It is dangerous and divisive and offensive to ask a student group to proclaim its innocence for something it hasn’t done or said,” she said. “It’s compelled speech, and that violates the First Amendment.”"
298,298,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/world/middleeast/bolivia-israel-gaza-ties.html,"Bolivia has severed relations with Israel over its strikes on Gaza, a diplomatic decision that Israel condemned as a “surrender to terrorism” even as its own ties with other countries in Latin America began to fray.

Bolivia announced the decision on Tuesday. Two other Latin American governments — in Chile and Colombia — said the same day that they were recalling their ambassadors to Israel in light of the strikes on Gaza, which have come in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, which killed about 1,400 people and left more than 200 others as hostages.

In a statement, Chile accused Israel of refusing to respect international laws and said its airstrikes were a “collective punishment of the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza.”

On Wednesday, Israel responded, saying that Colombian and Chilean citizens were among the victims on Oct. 7. “Israel expects Colombia and Chile to support the right of a democratic country to protect its citizens,” Lior Haiat, a spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Bolivia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it had cut diplomatic ties “in protest and condemnation of the aggressive and disproportionate Israeli military offensive taking place in the Gaza Strip, which threatens international peace and security.”

Bolivia had restored diplomatic ties with Israel in 2019 after a decade-long rupture that was also related to Israeli military actions in Gaza. In severing ties on Tuesday, Bolivia called for an end to Israeli strikes on Gaza, denounced the thousands of casualties the strikes have inflicted and urged that sufficient food, water and aid be allowed to enter the enclave.

Israel’s foreign ministry said that relations with Bolivia had been “devoid of content” under the Latin American country’s current government. “By taking this step, the Bolivian government is aligning itself with the Hamas terrorist organization,” the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.

Israel also accused Bolivia of bowing to the influence of Iran, which has long supported Hamas and other groups that oppose Israel.

Israel’s relationship with Colombia, friendly for years, has been strained in the aftermath of the Hamas attacks. President Gustavo Petro has also been starkly critical of the Israeli government. After Israel’s defense minister described Hamas as “human animals” in his announcement of the siege on Gaza, Mr. Petro remarked on X that “This is what the Nazis said about the Jews.”

Last month, after Israel said it was cutting off security exports to Colombia over the comment — which was also roundly condemned by Holocaust memorial organizations like the Simon Wiesenthal Center — Mr. Petro said he was open to suspending relations with Israel, although he stopped short of doing so on Tuesday.

The Palestinian cause has long received strong support in Latin America and elsewhere in the developing world. The war in Gaza is adding to resentments there and accusations that the West is applying a double standard in its approach to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.

Brazil has been described as a swing state of sorts in the developing world. This month, as the holder of the rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council, it drafted a resolution that called for a humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza and condemned the “heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas.”

Brazil’s ambassador to the United Nations, Sérgio França Danese, expressed frustration when the United States vetoed the resolution because it did not mention Israel’s right to self-defense.

“Hundreds of thousands of civilians in Gaza cannot wait any longer,” he said. “Actually, they have waited far too long.”

Two major Palestinian mobile networks, Jawwal and Paltel, said that “all telecom services” in the besieged strip were out of service “as all energy sources sustaining the network have been depleted, and fuel was not allowed in.”

The networks had repeatedly warned this week that dwindling supplies would halt their services amid a severe fuel shortage across the strip that has exacerbated an already dire humanitarian situation. UNRWA, the largest United Nations agency in Gaza, which has been distributing aid coming in from the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, said it would not be able to deliver assistance on Friday because of the blackout.

Israel has been preventing fuel from entering Gaza, saying Hamas uses it for rocket attacks and has stockpiled fuel intended for civilians, and has cut off electricity there since it began its bombing campaign after Hamas’s surprise attacks on Oct. 7."

Jake Silverstein, the editor of The New York Times Magazine, announced Ms. Hughes’s resignation in an email to staff members on Friday evening.

“While I respect that she has strong convictions, this was a clear violation of The Times’s policy on public protest,” Mr. Silverstein wrote. “This policy, which I fully support, is an important part of our commitment to independence.”

Mr. Silverstein said Ms. Hughes had previously violated the policy by signing another public letter this year. That letter, which was also signed by other contributors to The Times, protested the newspaper’s reporting on transgender issues.

“She and I discussed that her desire to stake out this kind of public position and join in public protests isn’t compatible with being a journalist at The Times, and we both came to the conclusion that she should resign,” Mr. Silverstein wrote in his note on Friday.

Ms. Hughes declined to comment. A Times spokeswoman had no further comment.

Ms. Hughes joined The Times in 2015 and worked as an editor and writer for the magazine. In 2020, she won an American Society of Magazine Editors Next award for journalists under 30. This year, she won a National Magazine Award for profile writing, for articles on Viola Davis and Whoopi Goldberg.

The petition Ms. Hughes signed about the Israel-Hamas war was published online last week by a group called Writers Against the War on Gaza. The group, which describes itself as “an ad hoc coalition committed to solidarity and the horizon of liberation for the Palestinian people,” denounced what it described as Israel’s “eliminationist assault” on Palestinians as well as the deaths of journalists reporting on the war. It was signed by hundreds of people, including other well-known journalists and authors.

“We stand firmly by Gaza’s people,” the letter said.

On Friday, a contributing writer at the magazine who had also signed the letter, Jamie Lauren Keiles, said in a post on X that he would no longer contribute to the publication. He said it was “a personal decision about what kind of work I want to be able to do.”"
301,301,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/technology/videos-bin-laden-letter-tiktok.html,"Videos on TikTok supporting a decades-old letter by Osama bin Laden criticizing the United States and its support of Israel surged in popularity this week, adding to accusations that the company is fueling the spread of antisemitic content. The White House condemned the resurfacing of the letter.

The letter, titled “Letter to America,” was published a year after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, that were orchestrated by Bin Laden. He defended the attacks in New York and Washington and said Americans had become “servants” to Jews, who he said controlled the country’s economy and media. American taxpayers, he wrote, were complicit in harming Muslims in the Middle East, including destroying Palestinian homes.

Some TikTok users said this week that they viewed the document as an awakening to America’s role in global affairs and expressed their disappointment in the United States. One popular video showed a TikTok user brushing her hair with the caption, “When you read Osama bin Laden’s letter to America and you realize you’ve been lied to your whole entire life.”

One video with nearly 100,000 likes showed a TikTok user at her kitchen sink with the caption: “Trying to go back to life as normal after reading Osama bin Laden’s ‘Letter to America’ and realizing everything we learned about the Middle East, 9/11, and ‘terrorism’ was a lie.” In a video with more than 60,000 views, another user said the letter showed her that America was a “plague on the entire world.”"
302,302,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-al-shifa-hospital-law.html,"The Israeli military has seized the Gaza Strip’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa. Israel says it needed to capture the hospital, in Gaza City, to destroy a Hamas command center and underground facilities that it says are there. Hamas and doctors at Al-Shifa deny Israeli allegations of Hamas fighters using the hospital as a base.

Here is what the Geneva Conventions and international criminal law say about hospitals and what protections they have, based on a series of interviews with experts on the laws of war and a reading of the major treaties that set out those laws.

Hospitals have special protections under international humanitarian law. It is illegal in nearly all circumstances to attack hospitals, ambulances or other medical facilities, or to interfere with their ability to provide care to the wounded and sick. That is true even if some of their patients are wounded fighters as well as civilians. Attacking a protected hospital is a war crime that can be prosecuted at the International Criminal Court. Using civilians, like those in a hospital, as human shields for combatants is also prohibited.

But there is an exception under which hospitals lose that protection: A hospital or medical facility can lose its special legal status if it is used for a military purpose that is “harmful to the enemy,” rather than just for medical care. For example, if an armed group uses a hospital building as a headquarters, it cannot use the special hospital protection as a shield for that military operation. The exception is supposed to be read narrowly, according to the Red Cross, which is considered a leading authority on the interpretation of humanitarian law. If there is doubt about whether a hospital is being used for military purposes, it should be presumed not to be, the Red Cross says.

Even if the exception applies, an attacking force has to give civilians a chance to evacuate. The Geneva Conventions state that before attacking a military target inside a hospital, the attacking force has to warn the doctors and patients inside that the hospital is going to be a target, and then give them a reasonable amount of time to escape. Israel has issued frequent warnings to hospitals in northern Gaza that they should evacuate. However, doctors have said that some patients are too fragile to be moved, or that there is no safe or practical evacuation route, raising questions about what could be considered reasonable warning.

Even if the exception applies, there are still strict rules that limit how force can be used. Doctors, patients, and other civilians who remain in the hospital after a warning to evacuate are still protected civilians. International humanitarian law says that civilians cannot ever be targeted directly. The exception applies only under “very narrow conditions,” said Tom Dannenbaum, an associate professor of international law at Tufts University."

The meeting, held on a video call for about 90 minutes and joined by more than 30 people in all, included the actors Sacha Baron Cohen, Debra Messing and Amy Schumer. It was led by Adam Presser, TikTok’s head of operations, and Seth Melnick, its global head of user operations. The executives said they wanted to know more about what the creators were experiencing to improve the app, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by The New York Times.

The celebrities and creators described, sometimes with fiery rhetoric, how TikTok’s tools did not prevent a flood of comments like “Hitler was right” or “I hope you end up like Anne Frank” under videos posted by them and other Jewish users.

“What is happening at TikTok is it is creating the biggest antisemitic movement since the Nazis,” Mr. Cohen, who does not appear to have an official TikTok account, said early in the call. He criticized violent imagery and disinformation on the platform, telling Mr. Presser, “Shame on you,” and claiming that TikTok could “flip a switch” to fix antisemitism on its platform."
304,304,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/business/lululemon-gaza-marathon-amena-saad.html,"In a statement to The New York Times, a spokesman for Lululemon said the company did not intend to exclude anyone from the photographs.

“We received incorrect information that Ms. Saad did not want to be included in the photos, and we have since reached out to her directly to apologize for our mistake,” the statement said. “Lululemon is committed to fostering an inclusive, diverse and welcoming environment, and we will continue to work to improve and advance our efforts going forward.”

The company assumed she did not want to participate because of safety concerns, but Ms. Saad said she had never expressed feeling unsafe.

The images were sent to the runners who appeared in the photo shoot but were not used by Lululemon or noname, the spokesman said. Ms. Saad said she saw them in a group chat with other leaders in the program and noticed she was the only one from the shoot cropped out of all the photos.

In an email reviewed by The Times, Lululemon apologized to Ms. Saad for the delay in getting back to her and acknowledged the mistake in not speaking with her directly about appearing in the photos.

Corporations have been under scrutiny for what they say publicly and to their employees since the war began last month, and many have penalized employees for posting online what they consider inflammatory statements.

Many Muslims, Arabs and supporters of Palestinians have said they should be free to call for a cease-fire online and voice their support for people on the ground in Gaza, pointing to rising anti-Muslim sentiment. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Hamas-controlled Gaza, Israeli strikes have killed more than 11,000 people in the territory. But critics have said that some of the rhetoric used by pro-Palestinian movements has minimized the suffering of Israeli Jews in the wake of the Hamas attack in Israel that killed about 1,200 people and has contributed to growing anti-Semitism.

Ms. Saad’s previous Instagram posts and stories have included links to fund-raisers for Palestinians and a page calling for a boycott of Boeing over materials it provided to Israeli forces. Her profile also links to a website called “DecolonizePalestine.”

Edward Ahmed Mitchell, the national deputy director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement to The Times that if what happened to Ms. Saad were true, “it would represent only the latest brazen act of anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian bigotry that we have witnessed.”

Ms. Saad, who ran her first marathon in London in April, ran the New York City Marathon with the New York City Muslim Running Club and finished at 3 hours 59 minutes and 20 seconds. She wore the Palestinian flag pinned above her heart.

In a separate statement to The Times, Ms. Saad said running had long been a passion of hers and “a vehicle for seeking out and building community” in New York City, where she lives. That included being a team leader for the noname program, leading the 8-minute-30 second-mile group.

“A big part of what was attractive about the noname program was its emphasis on inclusivity and embracing people’s full identities and experiences,” she wrote. “That’s why I felt so blindsided when I discovered that I had been cut out of the photos without any notice or communication.”

Ms. Saad said she pointed out the exclusion to Lululemon’s diversity, equity and inclusion team, and was not given “a clear or convincing explanation for my erasure from the campaign,” she said.

“For that to happen at the same time as this burgeoning anti-Arab and anti-Muslim sentiment made me feel both disappointed and deceived,” she wrote.

Noor Abukaram, a runner who was told she couldn’t run in her hijab in high school and pushed back, criticized Lululemon’s decision to leave out Ms. Saad.

“The timing is terrible,” she said. “If you’re a brand that’s representing sport, including our beautiful sport of running, then you should do it with the most integrity and with the most clear objective of why you’re doing this campaign.”

Ms. Abukaram said running has provided an outlet during the war.

“A lot of people might feel guilty to go for a run at a time like this when children are dying,” she said, but running has given her the chance to be “one with myself, my emotions and channel it into positive energy.”"

The demonstration was one of the most disruptive protests so far associated with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in San Francisco, where pro-Palestinian activists have focused on trying to capture the attention of President Biden. Mr. Biden addressed the APEC meeting on Thursday.

Other groups of activists have protested against President Xi Jinping of China over independence for Tibet, human rights abuses against Uyghurs, military activity around Taiwan and what they view as a lack of progress among a host of world leaders on climate change and workers’ rights.

Pro-Palestinian protesters said that they drove their own cars onto the bridge from the East Bay, stopped before the midpoint on Treasure Island and blocked all lanes headed into the city. Fifteen protesters covered themselves in shrouds and laid down in front of vehicles to represent dead bodies in Gaza.

306,306,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/world/middleeast/uk-labour-party-ceasefire-vote-gaza.html,"Britain’s main opposition Labour Party has suffered a significant rebellion in Parliament over its policy on Gaza, in a sign of the hardening of opinion in Western Europe against Israel’s military action in the enclave.

Defying their leader, Keir Starmer, 56 Labour lawmakers — more than a quarter of the party’s total — voted late Wednesday in favor of a motion calling for an immediate cease-fire, going beyond their party’s official position of working to achieve longer humanitarian pauses in the conflict.

Although none of Mr. Starmer’s top team rebelled, eight lawmakers who held less senior leadership positions did, and either resigned or were fired from those posts.

The vote has no practical impact but was closely watched, because Labour is well ahead in opinion polls, putting it in a strong position to win a general election that is expected next fall.

The rebellion illustrates growing concerns in Western Europe over the number of civilians killed and wounded in Israel’s military action in the Gaza Strip, and the rising pressure on lawmakers over the issue from those they represent. A series of protest marches in Britain have demanded a cease-fire in recent weeks, and one in London last Saturday drew an estimated 300,000 people.

The best known of the Labour rebels, Jess Phillips, who resigned from her position speaking for the party on domestic-violence issues, said she was voting with “my constituents, my head and my heart, which has felt as if it were breaking over the last four weeks.” She added that she could see “no route where the current military action does anything but put at risk the hope of peace and security for anyone in the region now and in the future.”

Middle East policy is politically sensitive within the Labour Party, whose leadership has stuck close to the British and United States government positions on Gaza recently and has not supported calls for a cease-fire. Mr. Starmer expressed firm support for Israel in the aftermath of the bloody incursions into Israeli territory by Hamas fighters in October.

The rebellion in Parliament is the first significant setback in months for Mr. Starmer. Late Wednesday, he said he regretted that some of his colleagues had felt the need to support the motion calling for a cease-fire, which was proposed by the Scottish National Party.

But while the vote represents a challenge to Mr. Starmer’s authority and displayed internal divisions, the Labour leader appears to have calculated that he would rather risk a rebellion than soften his position."
307,307,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/opinion/college-university-antisemitism-crt.html,"Over the past five weeks, Jewish students on America’s campuses have found themselves confronted with those who celebrate a terrorist operation that featured the mass murder and reportedly the rape of fellow Jews. They see images of people tearing down posters of kidnapped Jewish children. At M.I.T., Jewish students report that they were told by some faculty members to avoid the university’s main lobby — which had been the site of a pro-Palestinian protest — for their own safety. At Cooper Union, Jewish students were barricaded in the library by a protest that started out as a pro-Palestinian demonstration and quickly became, one student reported, “pure anti-Jew.”

Rabbi Nomi Manon, who has directed the Hillel at the University at Albany since 2011, told The Albany Times-Union, “Every Jewish student that I talk to feels a sense of impending doom, anxiety, fear or anger about the really marked rise in antisemitism.” Shabbos Kestenbaum, who is a graduate student at the Harvard Divinity School, told The Forward, “The past few weeks have been the most isolating, saddening, maddening experience I’ve ever had.”

Universities are supposed to be centers of inquiry and curiosity — places where people are tolerant of difference and learn about other points of view. Instead, too many have become brutalizing ideological war zones, so today the most hostile place to be an American Jew is not at some formerly restricted country club but on a college campus.

How on earth did this happen? I’ve been teaching on college campuses off and on for 25 years. It’s become increasingly evident to me that American adolescence and young adulthood — especially for those who wind up at elite schools — now happen within a specific kind of ideological atmosphere.

It centers on a hard-edged ideological framework that has been spreading in high school and college, on social media, in diversity training seminars and in popular culture. The framework doesn’t have a good name yet. It draws on the thinking of intellectuals ranging from the French philosopher Michel Foucault to the critical race theorist Derrick Bell. (For a good intellectual history, I recommend Yascha Mounk’s recent book, “The Identity Trap.”)

The common ideas associated with this ideology are by now pretty familiar:

We shouldn’t emphasize what unites all human beings; we should emphasize what divides us.

Human relations are power struggles between oppressors and oppressed groups.

Human communication is limited. A person in one group can never really understand the experience of someone in another group.

The goal of rising above bigotry is naïve. Bigotry and racism are permanent and indestructible components of American society.

Seemingly neutral tenets of society — like free speech, academic freedom, academic integrity and the meritocracy — are tools the powerful use to preserve their power.

There are many teachers and administrators who believe that they best serve society not by being open and curious and searching for the truth but by propagating this ideological framework."

Her father, Ron Pundak, was in Norway conducting back-channel talks with Palestinians that resulted in the 1993 Oslo Accords, the foundation for the two-state solution that has long anchored the peace process, and that President Biden recently invoked as the answer to the latest war.

Now 38 and a human rights lawyer, Ms. Pundak wants to revamp the Oslo-centered process, which has been mostly stalled for three decades. While she labels her plan a “two-state solution 2.0,” it is in some ways a repudiation of the vision that her father and his generation had espoused.

“The two-state solution has become — and I say this with a broken heart — an empty shell,” Ms. Pundak said. “It started as a promise of freedom and liberation for Palestinians, but it has transformed into multiple systems of oppression, a lack of hope, lack of vision and lack of future.”

Across the line that divides Israel from the West Bank, the same frustration is palpable in Rana Salman, a 39-year-old Palestinian activist who shares Ms. Pundak’s dream of a political settlement. Her father once commuted to Jerusalem, where he worked as a hotel cook. Now, Ms. Salman said, her family was stranded in its hometown, Bethlehem, by Israeli military roadblocks erected after the war broke out.

Yet Ms. Salman is not giving up: She, too, hopes that out of the trauma of the Hamas attacks and Israel’s war in Gaza, a new peace process can be born — one that takes account of how much has changed since the 1990s."

The mood music was upbeat but pragmatic after the first face-to-face meeting in a year between President Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. There was no joint communiqué after Wednesday’s talks, but both sides issued positive statements trumpeting where they found common ground, including on tackling climate change and improving communications.

The San Francisco summit, and Xi’s banquet with American business leaders afterward, were signs of how entwined the economies remain despite years of rising tensions — and why both sides and many U.S. companies don’t want the relationship spiraling into a more serious conflict.

Biden and Xi found room for cooperation. The leaders agreed to restart military communications that were suspended last year after Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of the House, visited Taiwan. Biden said they had made progress on curbing Chinese production of the opioid fentanyl.

But there was plenty they didn’t agree upon. Xi complained that U.S. export controls on advanced technology, such as semiconductors, were intended to suppress China. Biden’s effort to enlist Beijing as a kind of peacekeeper in the Middle East — specifically, putting pressure on Iran to not escalate the Israel-Hamas war — was unsuccessful."

President Biden said on Wednesday that the endpoint of the Israel-Hamas conflict has to be a Palestinian state that is “real,” existing alongside an Israeli one.

He added that he and his aides have been negotiating with Arab nations on next steps, but did not give any details.

“I can tell you, I don’t think it ultimately ends until there’s a two-state solution,” Mr. Biden said at a news conference on an estate south of San Francisco after his summit with Xi Jinping, China’s leader.

Mr. Biden and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken have been publicly emphasizing the need for a two-state solution in recent days. The establishment of a Palestinian state has long been a U.S. policy goal, but no recent administration has succeeded in making any substantial headway on the issue. The last major push along those lines came from John Kerry when he was secretary of state in the Obama administration.

Mr. Biden said he did not have a specific idea of when to tell Israel it should halt its war in Gaza. He said the fighting would end once Hamas could no longer do “horrific things” to Israelis. Hamas still has weapons and technology beneath hospitals in Gaza, he said.

U.S. officials have been saying in recent days that Hamas maintains a compound beneath Al-Shifa Hospital, which the Israeli military raided this week despite the presence of civilian patients and doctors. Israeli officials have said that the hospital sits atop a major hub of Hamas’s tunnel network, and that the terrorist group stockpiles weapons in the area.

Fighters from Hamas and other militant groups killed about 1,200 people on Oct. 7 in southern Israel. The groups also kidnapped about 240 others.

Israel’s strikes on Gaza in response have killed at least 11,000 people, about 40 percent of them children, according to the health ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas.

Mr. Biden said Israeli forces were allowing doctors and nurses at Al-Shifa to get out of harm’s way, and that “this is a different story than I believe what was occurring before with indiscriminate bombing.”

Hamas has released four hostages since Oct. 7, and told Israel recently through mediators in Qatar that it is willing to release about 50 more, all women and children, if the right conditions are met, including a release by Israel of a similar number of women and children being held prisoner, said an official briefed on the talks.

Israeli officials have said Hamas has at least 100 women and children and should release them all, the official said. The negotiators are also discussing the possibility of Israel pausing its strikes for three days to allow for the release of hostages in batches.

Mr. Biden said he was “mildly hopeful” that some hostages would be released, but added he did not know what had occurred during talks in the last four hours.

Mr. Biden added that the United States had been working well with Qatar, which hosts an office for Hamas’s political leaders, to try and secure the release of the hostages."
311,311,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/world/middleeast/united-nations-security-council-israel-gaza.html,"The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution on Wednesday calling for immediate and urgent dayslong humanitarian pauses in the Israel-Hamas war to allow desperately needed aid to reach civilians in Gaza.

The resolution put forth by Malta passed after weeks of division and inaction over the Israel-Gaza war. It stopped short of calling for a cease-fire, and it did not spell out the number of days for a humanitarian pause, instead calling for “a sufficient number of days” for “the full, rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access.”

The resolution is legally binding and called for all parties to comply with international laws of conflict that demand that civilians, especially children, be protected. It also called for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held by Hamas.

The resolution passed with twelve votes, with the remaining three members — the United States, Britain and Russia — abstaining.

Four previous resolutions had failed. Diplomats said that Malta’s resolution was a compromise intended to achieve consensus on language focused tightly on humanitarian issues with an emphasis on the plight of children.

Before Wednesday’s vote, Russia asked for an amendment to the resolution that would demand a cease-fire. The majority of Security Council member states, voted for a resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire on Oct 26. The proposal was not adopted because it did not get the required nine votes. The U.S. was the lone member that voted against a cease-fire.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said that the passing of the resolution on Wednesday showed that the Council could still work together. She said the United States could not vote for a resolution that did not condemn Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel and state that countries have the right to defend themselves. But she said the United States supported many of the resolution’s provisions such as the release of hostages and humanitarian pauses.

“Much more aid is urgently needed. The current levels are woefully insufficient,” Ms. Thomas-Greenfield said. “We are hopeful that humanitarian pauses will help the U.N. and humanitarian partners deliver aid and enable the safe passage of civilians fleeing violence.”"
312,312,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/opinion/britain-protests-gaza.html,"In Britain, Armistice Day is usually an understated affair, marked only by two minutes of silence at 11 a.m. This year was considerably more eventful, as two very different protests descended on London.

One, composed of hundreds of thousands of people calling for a cease-fire in Gaza, snaked peacefully through the west of the city and over the River Thames — a patchwork of red, green, white and black. The other, comprising a few hundred people from Britain’s far right and football hooligan networks, gathered several miles away in Westminster. Ostensibly there to defend a key national war memorial from the peace marchers, the group clashed with Metropolitan Police officers. By the day’s close, 145 people, most of them right-wing counterprotesters, had been arrested.

Behind the tumult stood Suella Braverman. As home secretary, she spent days pressuring Britain’s top security officials to ban the pro-Palestinian demonstrations, which she denigrated as “hate marches.” When that proved unsuccessful, she published an article — apparently not authorized by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak — accusing the police of bias, an incendiary intervention that has been widely blamed for bolstering the far-right presence in central London on Saturday. Mr. Sunak sacked her on Monday. Her departure was quickly overshadowed by the shock return to frontline politics of the former prime minister David Cameron, the architect of austerity and Brexit.

For all her extremist posturing, Ms. Braverman is part of an establishment consensus that firmly backs Israel’s war in Gaza. At the same time, as the humanitarian catastrophe in the enclave worsens, a mass grass-roots movement calling for a cease-fire is gaining strength, backed by much of the country. Yet Westminster’s leaders remain unmoved in their support for Israel’s military campaign. In Britain, as its politicians and public move away from each other, reality is cleaving in two."
313,313,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/opinion/israel-gaza-antisemitism.html,"Last week, I gave a lecture at the University of California at San Diego about politics and social justice. Afterward, as I was signing books, a young Black woman approached my table and whispered a question, asking me what I thought about the horrors playing out in Gaza.

The next person in line was an older Jewish woman who implored me to “do whatever you can” to change people’s opinions because “everybody hates us now,” noting that Jewish people had always stood up for civil rights.

Both women had come to hear me speak, expressed their approval of my work in general and, I would assume, agreed with me on many issues. But on the political fallout from the war in Gaza, it seemed pretty clear that they had divergent views, but each assumed that I agreed with her point of view.

Of course, both women are individuals, not spokeswomen for their entire communities. But even so, those brief conversations were a small example of how the war between Israel and Hamas has strained perceptions and relationships in this country among key groups in the progressive coalition and how so many feel as if they’re obligated to declare where they stand.

Taking a position against the killing of civilians — such as Hamas’s Oct. 7 terror attack and the Israeli military’s operations in Gaza — is relatively easy. It gets harder when considering support for or opposition to the overall prosecution of the war, including the growing calls for a cease-fire. And when the aperture is widened from the particulars of the current violence to the history of the broader conflict, the divergence of opinions becomes even more stark and complicated.

A few weeks ago, I interviewed several pro-Palestinian activists and scholars in America. Almost all of them described themselves as anti-Zionist, but in our conversations, all of them also condemned antisemitism. This week, I turned to Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League — whom I spoke to soon after he appeared at Tuesday’s March for Israel that drew tens of thousands of people to the National Mall — who sees anti-Zionism, by definition, as antisemitism. He told me, “Zionism is fundamental to Judaism.” He believes that claiming to be anti-Zionist but not antisemitic is like someone saying in 1963 that “I’m against the civil rights movement, but I’m also against racism.”

He not only believes that you can be a harsh critic of the Israeli government without being anti-Zionist; he also says that he, like many others, supports Palestinian identity and Palestinian nationalism while also being a Zionist.

It is here, in the dispute over definitions, that things begin to break down and where people on both sides of the issue, who all see themselves as standing for righteousness, are frequently seen by those on the opposing side as standing for hatred and cruelty.

For instance, there are several forms of Zionism, and people in these debates rarely seem to be explicit about which form they are for or against. Political Zionism? Cultural Zionism? Religious Zionism? Some combination of them? Does it matter?

This lack of specificity can contribute to cynicism.

When I talked to the pro-Palestinian activists and scholars, I posed a simple question that is often asked: Do you believe that Israel has a right to exist? To my surprise, none answered with a direct “yes.”

One of them, the journalist and scholar Marc Lamont Hill, a co-author of “Except for Palestine: The Limits of Progressive Politics,” told me he believes that “all nations deserve to have their territorial integrity honored and respected” and doesn’t believe we should be “harming Israel as a state.” He also believes the question is flawed because, in his view, it “presumes that every other state’s right to exist has been affirmed but Israel’s.”

He believes that in that question, what people are really asking is whether Israel has the right to exist “as a Jewish state, as an ethnocentric state,” to which he responds, “no nation has the right to not be a state of all of its citizens” or to “create a hierarchy along ethnic, racial, gender, religious lines.” As Hill sees it, “It would be like asking Native Americans if America has a right to exist.” He specified that his critique is specifically about political Zionism.

When I told Greenblatt that none of my interviewees gave a direct “yes” to the right-to-exist question, he said that was “almost indescribably offensive” because he connects any hesitation on the question to historical antisemitism and a denial of the Jewish people’s right to self-determination.

But Greenblatt and Hill do agree on a narrower point: that there is discrimination against Arabs in Israel. “There’s definitely discrimination there,” Greenblatt said.

Amnesty International has gone much further, accusing Israel of operating an “apartheid regime” and declaring that “whether they live in Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, or Israel itself, Palestinians are treated as an inferior racial group and systematically deprived of their rights.”

I emerge from these discussions feeling a sense of whiplash, aware that the dispute is playing out with antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents in this country surging and fear rippling through Jewish, Muslim and Arab communities.

After talking to everyone, I wished that they could all have been in a room talking to one another.

It’s hard to accept that smart people who seem to want to do the right thing can’t find some common understanding on these issues, find more points of agreement and pull out of a descending cycle of recriminations.

If they don’t, I fear that this dispute will be a lose-lose for all."
314,314,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/us/politics/israel-gaza-war-misinformation-videos.html,"In a video circulating online meant to convey the horrors of the war between Israel and Hamas, a small boy wails, his face caked in dust. Clinging to the sandwich he was eating when an airstrike razed his family’s home, he sobs for his two teenage sisters lost amid the chaos, one of whom would later be confirmed dead.

“A little boy crying for his sisters in Gaza,” reads a post accompanying the video, which was widely shared in recent weeks on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

Yet the boy’s cries actually rang out hundreds of miles away, in Syria, nearly a decade before Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza over the past three weeks.

As Israel sends its troops farther into Gaza, vowing to eradicate Hamas in retaliation for a brazen assault in early October that massacred more than 1,400 people, videos and photographs of the conflict offer a powerful record of the costs of war. But online, those accounts are competing with misappropriated depictions of unrelated tragedies — a cycle that experts say not only diminishes the experiences of victims past and present but also risks casting doubt on legitimate evidence of atrocities from the war. Photographs and clips taken out of context are a common form of misinformation, but experts say their misuse to relay the extent of suffering is particularly egregious.

“Can you imagine the kind of commodification of violence against a loved one and have that be used by others as a kind of generic depiction of violence?” said Elisa Massimino, the executive director of the Human Rights Institute at Georgetown University. “It’s horrifying.”

Among the popular images and videos supposedly illustrating the human toll of the war: A heap of dead children swaddled in white, described as Palestinians killed by Israeli forces. (In fact, the children are Syrian and the photograph was taken in 2013.) A young boy trembling in the dark, covered in a white residue and grasping a tree, cast as “another traumatized child in Gaza.” (In fact, the video was taken after a recent flood in Tajikistan.) A teenage girl being beaten by a mob and fatally lit on fire, promoted as proof of the ruthlessness of Hamas. (In fact, the video was filmed in Guatemala in 2015, and the girl was reportedly attacked over accusations she was involved in the killing of a taxi driver.)

For the photographer who filmed the Syrian boy crying for his sisters in Aleppo in 2014 as the Syrian government bombed rebel-held parts of the city, the appropriation of his work to illustrate the brutality of conflict is familiar, and he believes it can undermine the current reality.

“This is not the first time I hear that my photos and videos are being used outside its original context,” the photographer, Hosam Katan, said in an interview. Mr. Katan worked for the Aleppo Media Center, a group of antigovernment activists and citizen journalists, and is now based in Germany. “Maybe some people are trying to get more empathy for Gaza, but at the same time, such fake videos or photos will have the opposite impact, losing the credibility of the main story.”"

President Biden and President Xi Jinping of China shook hands at the entrance of a grand estate set in the hills of California yesterday as they began their first meeting in a year.

“To host you in the United States is a great honor and a pleasure,” Biden told the Chinese leader.

“Planet Earth is big enough” for both superpowers, Xi said. He told Biden that their countries were very different but that they should be “fully capable of rising above differences.”

“I firmly believe in the promising future of the bilateral relationship,” he said.

The two nations have spiraled into their worst relationship in four decades, and Biden’s primary goal was simple: Find a way to keep an increasingly bitter competition with China from tipping into conflict.

316,316,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/world/middleeast/israel-ground-invasion-gaza-soldiers.html,"At least 15 Israeli soldiers have been killed in battles in northern Gaza since Tuesday as its forces press deeper into the enclave, attacking dozens of targets affiliated with its Hamas rulers, the Israeli military said.

The 15 deaths, mostly of infantry soldiers, were the first casualties inside Gaza publicly confirmed by Israel’s military since it launched a ground invasion on Friday, as fighting appeared to intensify and its forces pushed closer to Gaza City, the biggest city in the territory.

The military wing of Hamas said on Telegram on Tuesday that its fighters had ambushed some Israeli soldiers at a building in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza. Neither side’s account of the fighting could be independently confirmed.

In Israel, a small country in which military conscription is a mandatory rite of passage for many Jewish citizens, the soldiers’ names and faces were plastered on the home pages of most news websites. Others were read out live on Israeli television when the military announced their deaths on Wednesday.

The Israeli military said it has struck more than 11,000 targets in the Gaza Strip since Oct. 7, when it launched an intense campaign of airstrikes in response to a Hamas attack that killed some 1,400 people in Israel and saw just over 200 people taken hostage. The scale of the bombardment exceeds that of any of its previous wars with Palestinian militants in the 140-square-mile enclave.

The toll of the ground invasion is only starting to become clear. On Tuesday, Israeli forces took over what they said was a Hamas military stronghold in western Jabaliya, a densely packed residential area north of Gaza City, claiming to kill more than 50 militants. There was no immediate comment by Hamas.

Israeli forces also struck what they said was a Hamas stronghold in Jabaliya, causing widespread devastation. Pictures of the blasts showed Palestinians walking amid the rubble in an apparent search for survivors.

An Israeli military spokesman clarified that they were two separate attacks but declined to provide a timeline or elaborate further.

Gaza’s health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, said the attack had killed and wounded hundreds of people. Another health official said there were dozens dead and that his facility had received hundreds of injured patients. The figures could not be independently verified.

The strike had killed a Hamas commander who was a key plotter of the Oct. 7 assault on Israel, the Israeli military said. Hamas denied that any of its commanders were in the area.

Senior Israeli officials have said the goal of the military operation is to dismantle Hamas, although it is far from clear what would happen if they were to succeed. Officials have told the Israeli public to expect a long, bloody campaign against the Palestinian armed group.

“This is a difficult campaign, it requires combat in Gaza,” Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel’s national security adviser, told reporters in Tel Aviv on Tuesday, before news of the soldiers’ deaths was announced. “There is no combat without a painful price.”"
317,317,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/nyregion/columbia-university-ban-student-groups-israel-hamas-war.html,"As police officers guarded the wrought iron gates protecting Columbia University’s main campus on Tuesday evening, checking for student identification cards, a group gathered around a stone sundial at the center of the quad.

Roughly 400 students held Palestinian flags and handmade signs. Protesters took turns speaking into a microphone, criticizing the Israel-Hamas war, but also their own school over its decision to suspend two pro-Palestinian student groups through the end of the semester.

“We’ve said it before, that our voices are louder and more powerful than the money that you receive, Columbia,” said Mohsen Mahdawi, 33, a student and a Palestinian refugee. “We won’t be silenced.”

And on Wednesday, roughly 200 faculty members walked out to protest the decision to suspend the groups, Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace. Professors, graduate workers and others read statements in support of the groups and their members as a Police Department helicopter buzzed overhead. Hundreds of students joined the crowd to cheer on the faculty members as they spoke.

“Where is your moral courage?” Premilla Nadasen, 56, a history professor at Barnard College, asked the administration. “We are here to tell the students: They can suspend an organization, but they cannot suspend a movement.”

Similar scenes have become increasingly common in New York City and across the country as college campuses grapple with the fallout from the war. Divisions over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have existed on campuses for generations, but as the war continues and the death toll in Gaza continues to mount, colleges have faced growing blowback over efforts to contain the discord.

Columbia suspended the groups last week, saying they had violated university policy. The university did not elaborate on how exactly the groups did that except to say they had held “unauthorized” events that included unspecified “threatening rhetoric and intimidation.”

Following their suspension, the groups released a joint statement on Instagram, accusing the university of “selective censorship” of pro-Palestinian groups and calling the move “an attack on free speech to distract from and enable Israel’s genocidal campaign against the Palestinian people.”"
318,318,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/opinion/hostages-israel-war.html,"More than five weeks ago, on Oct. 7, my brother-in-law Omri Miran was yanked away from his wife, my sister Lishay, and their two beautiful daughters, Roni and Alma, and kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Nahal Oz. The four of them had been held captive together at gunpoint by Hamas terrorists and their accomplices for hours; the family witnessed their community burn and their neighbors executed. And then they were separated: Omri was taken captive to the Gaza Strip, and Lishay, Roni and Alma were left behind, waiting for a similar fate or worse before Israel Defense Forces soldiers eventually rescued them.

For 40 days, Lishay has not known whether Omri is alive or dead, what his mental and physical status is, if he is treated well or not and whether she will ever again be able to say “I love you” — her last words to him before they were separated. She lives in terrible limbo.

Hundreds of thousands marched through London, Paris, Berlin and other European capitals over the last few weekends. Tens of thousands more attended demonstrations across the United States, including an enormous one in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Some were in support of Israel’s right to defend itself, some called for a cessation of antisemitism, and others marched for a cease-fire in Gaza or in support of the Palestinian cause. But for my family, there will be no end to this pain and no peace until the 240 hostages that Hamas kidnapped are rescued. We march for their release.

Omri, Lishay, Roni and Alma are not political pawns; they are human beings who deserve to be reunited as a family. Hamas has yet to allow any international humanitarian group to visit the Israelis and foreign nationals being held captive; we have no means of knowing if Hamas has kept the hostages alive or in what condition, let alone their general well-being. We pray they are still alive and in good health. But that we have no idea illustrates the urgent need to prioritize the release of all the hostages as a condition for any humanitarian pause or cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas."
319,319,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/technology/hate-speech-israel-gaza-internet.html,"Some of the antisemitic and anti-Islam posts have been shared and liked hundreds of thousands of times, even though they appear to violate the rules of social media platforms, many of which ban hate speech.

The content has been most prominent on X, according to the Anti-Defamation League and other researchers. In an analysis by the Anti-Defamation League of 162,958 posts on X and 15,476 posts on Facebook from Sept. 30 to Oct. 13, the surge in antisemitic content on X far exceeded that of Facebook. Nearly two million posts with the hashtag #IsraeliNewNazism appeared on X in that period, and another 40,000 posts featured the hashtag #ZionistsAreEvil or #ZionistsAreNazis.

More than 46,000 posts with the hashtag #HitlerWasRight also appeared over the last month on X, according to Memetica, a digital investigations firm. In previous months, the hashtag appeared fewer than 5,000 times a month. Two other hashtags — #DeathtotheJews and #DeathtoJews — showed up more than 51,000 times in the last month, compared with 2,000 the month before.

The hashtag #LevelGaza appeared nearly 3,000 times on X in the week after the Oct. 7 attacks, up from fewer than a dozen in September, Memetica also found. There were also thousands of posts on the platform with the hashtags #MuslimPig and #KillMuslims.

Other sites, including TikTok and Facebook, have also experienced surges in hate speech but have removed the content that was flagged to them, researchers said. The hate speech that remained was often more veiled, such as a TikTok trend of using “Austrian painter” as code for Adolf Hitler.

A TikTok spokeswoman said that the “Austrian painter” videos violated the app’s policies and that videos with the hashtag were removed after The Times brought them to the company’s attention. From Oct. 7 to Oct. 13, she added, TikTok took down 730,000 videos for violating hate speech rules.

X did not respond to a request for comment. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, referred to a blog post on how the company is enforcing its policies against hate speech.

Messaging apps such as Telegram have also been used to seed hate speech in the conflict. On Oct. 7, a Hamas-linked Telegram channel shared an image of a paraglider descending with a Palestinian flag and the words “I stand with Palestine.” The image referred to the Hamas gunmen who used paragliders to enter the Nova music festival in Israel, where more than 260 people were killed in the Oct. 7 attacks.

Within 24 hours, the image was shared thousands of times on X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, according to ActiveFence, a cybersecurity company that advises social media platforms. Underneath some of the posts on Facebook and Instagram were comments such as “they should have killed more” and “kill more Jews.”

By Oct. 9, a group called NatSoc Florida had created a T-shirt with the image, according to ActiveFence. The image soon spread to 4chan and later appeared in variations with Pepe the Frog, a cartoon character that has been appropriated by white supremacists.

The meme quickly spread through organizations that were primed to embrace antisemitic or racist causes, including those not directly involved in the conflict between Israel and Gaza, said Noam Schwartz, ActiveFence’s chief executive.

“The meme is very, very good,” he said. “It’s a terrible thing to say, but it’s recognizable, like an icon.”

Telegram did not respond to a request for comment.

On several far-right Telegram channels and on 4chan, some users have recently discussed the war as an opportunity to spread antisemitic sentiment to people who are normally ideological opposites. One Telegram channel included instructions for far-right users who espouse antisemitism to post sympathetically about the deaths of Palestinians in Gaza to draw in left-wing activists.

“Once you get them there, blame the Jews,” one person wrote.

Adi Cohen, the chief operating officer of Memetica, said the rise in antisemitic posts reflected a convergence of goals by far-right and far-left activists.

“Some of them explicitly say this is an opportunity to gloat and celebrate the killing of Jews online,” he said. “They are trying to lure an audience to their content, and this is a huge growth moment for them.”"
320,320,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/us/politics/rashida-tlaib-israel-ads.html,"A Democratic pro-Israel group on Thursday is beginning to air television ads that criticize Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, in the first attempt to hit back on the airwaves at the growing caucus of Israel skeptics within the Democratic Party.

The ad from the group, Democratic Majority for Israel, comes as President Biden and other Democrats face a backlash from the left for their stalwart support of Israel as it bombs and invades the Gaza Strip in retaliation for the Oct. 7 Hamas attack.

Ms. Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress and one of two Muslim women in the House, has been one of the most outspoken progressive supporters of the Palestinian cause. She is one of 18 House Democrats who have co-sponsored a resolution that calls for a cease-fire in the conflict.

The ad, which is set to air on broadcast and cable in Detroit, where Ms. Tlaib’s district is based, denounces Ms. Tlaib’s votes against funding for Israel’s Iron Dome missile protection system and against a resolution to condemn the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. The ad argues that the cease-fire legislation “would allow the terrorists to rearm themselves.”

Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who is the president of Democratic Majority for Israel, said, “It’s important to us for people who live in the Detroit area to understand what her positions have been and just how out of step and radical her positions have been.”

He added, “We hope that will lead her to either moderate her positions or perhaps for someone who is more moderate to be interested in the race.”

Mr. Mellman said, however, that his group was “not actively recruiting” candidates to challenge Ms. Tlaib next year.

Democratic Majority for Israel has bought just over $100,000 in advertising on broadcast stations, CNN, MSNBC and CNBC in the Detroit market, according to data compiled by Medium Buying, an advertising firm.

Ms. Tlaib, whose term ends in January 2025, does not have a major primary opponent, and has not faced a well-funded challenger since she was first elected to Congress in 2018. Last year, she took 64 percent of the primary vote against three Democratic rivals. Her district votes overwhelmingly Democratic in general elections.

Richard Czuba, an independent pollster with an expertise in Michigan politics, said Ms. Tlaib was broadly popular in her district, which covers parts of Detroit and its suburbs, including Dearborn, and was known locally for her strong constituent service. Dearborn has a large population of Arab and Muslim Americans.

Ms. Tlaib has said that she voted against U.S. funding for Israel’s military because it had “no conditions on upholding human rights” of Palestinians. She said she voted against the resolution condemning the Oct. 7 attack “because it is a deeply incomplete and biased account of what is happening in Israel and Palestine, and what has been happening for decades.”

An aide to Ms. Tlaib responded to part of the ad that showed a clip of her ignoring a question about unconfirmed reports of “Hamas terrorists chopping off babies’ heads.”

The aide said Ms. Tlaib had ignored the shouted question at the Capitol because it came from a Fox News reporter. “I do not support the targeting and killing of civilians, whether in Israel or Palestine,” Ms. Tlaib said in a statement from her office. “The fact that some have suggested otherwise is offensive and rooted in bigoted assumptions about my faith and ethnicity.”

Several of Ms. Tlaib’s progressive colleagues who have emerged as skeptics of the American alliance with Israel since the war began, including Representatives Summer Lee of Pennsylvania and Jamaal Bowman of New York, are now facing primary challenges from rivals backed by pro-Israel organizations."
321,321,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/opinion/unarmed-teen-israel-gaza.html,"On the afternoon of his 15th birthday, Attiya Nabaheen was walking home from his school in Gaza when an Israeli soldier shot him in the neck. It was November 2014, and Mr. Nabaheen was on his family’s land, situated about 500 meters from the militarized Green Line demarcating the Gaza Strip. In court proceedings, a lawyer representing the Israeli government claimed that Mr. Nabaheen was too close to the fence and didn’t heed warning shots before he was hit. Neither his age nor the fact that he was unarmed stopped the soldier from firing at the boy. The injury left Mr. Nabaheen permanently paralyzed and wheelchair bound for the rest of his life. This all happened during a cease-fire, a time of supposed peace, or status quo, in Gaza.

I’m a human rights lawyer from Haifa, now completing my doctorate studies in the United States. I also litigate Palestinian civil and political rights cases, and Mr. Nabaheen was my client. I represented him as part of a landmark case that sought civil remedies for his life-changing injuries through the Israeli court system. The case didn’t go how we had hoped it would: It ended with the Israeli Supreme Court upholding the constitutionality of a 2012 law under which residents of the Gaza Strip are effectively banned from claiming civil remedies against Israeli actions, including unlawful actions with no connection to active situations of armed conflict. Put simply, Mr. Nabaheen’s case set a chilling precedent such that no one in Gaza can seek compensation for any damages caused by Israel.

I say Mr. Nabaheen was my client because last month I received word that he, along with 12 of his family members, 10 of them children, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on his family’s building the day after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Mr. Nabaheen, who was 24 at the time of his death, had survived five major attacks on Gaza. This was the one that finally killed him. His short life is emblematic of the policies and practices that the Israeli regime imposes on Palestinians in Gaza. Without meaningful avenues to make a claim against injustice, Palestinians are effectively left with no place to turn. But the people of Gaza, like all people, deserve to enjoy full civil rights, including the right to compensatory damages. Without those rights, what can we expect them to do with their pain?

I took on Mr. Nabaheen’s case in the summer of 2022 on behalf of the Haifa-based Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights, and the Gaza-based Al Mezan Center for Human Rights. His original claim, filed in a district court in 2016, sought compensation from the Israeli Ministry of Defense for his debilitating injury. By the time I took his case, the Supreme Court had already dismissed his initial appeal, upholding the 2012 law shielding the Israeli government from providing civil remedies to the potential war crime he was the victim of. The rehearing request I filed would be the final episode of his tedious legal battle.

Mr. Nabaheen sued Israel in Israeli courts. His odds of success were low: Over the past seven decades, Palestinians in Gaza have brought fewer than 10 successful claims for compensation in the Israeli court system. Most of those cases were brought before the 2000s.

As a lawyer, my ability to tell the stories of those killed and injured by the Israeli carnage in Gaza is almost nonexistent because of the siege. I never met Mr. Nabaheen in person: The intense blockade over Gaza made it impossible for him to visit me, and vice versa. But for my client, and for all of us at Adalah and Al Mezan, giving up on effectively the only pathway to claim redress for Mr. Nabaheen’s injury was not a choice. Our client decided to challenge the constitutionality of the law that prevented people like him from suing in the first place.

This was the first case to do so, and it became all the more important as the use of snipers surged during the 2018 Great March of Return protests across the Israeli fence encircling Gaza. Later that year, the United Nations established an independent commission of inquiry to investigate Israeli conduct in the protests. The commission found that the district court’s dismissal of Mr. Nabaheen’s case in 2018 denied residents of Gaza from fulfilling “their right to ‘effective legal remedy’ from Israel that is guaranteed to them under international law.” In the same report, the independent commission found that over the course of nine months in 2018, Israeli security forces shot and killed 183 Palestinians, including 32 children. It found that Israeli snipers shot and injured over 6,000 unarmed demonstrators with live ammunition.

Despite these grave violations of international law, the Israeli Supreme Court refused to assess key evidence collected by human rights groups and granted a green light for Israeli military snipers to continue to use live ammunition against demonstrators. The chair of the U.N.-convened commission remarked that Israel’s conduct “may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity, and must be immediately investigated by Israel.” The U.N., in effect, was requesting that the fox guard the hen house.

The Supreme Court’s approach toward potential war crimes remained consistent. Mr. Nabaheen’s first appeal to the court was dismissed in 2022. Then, in February, the Israeli Supreme Court president at the time, Esther Hayut, rejected our request for a rehearing of the Nabaheen case, despite confessing that the result for him “is difficult, and so are its potential ramifications on Gaza residents in similar circumstances.” Ultimately, though, she did not deem the case “special and exceptional” enough to pass the legal grounds for holding a rehearing. Last year, the Hayut court had rejected a petition to reopen an investigation in the case of the four Bakr boys, who had been killed in an Israeli airstrike while playing on the beach in Gaza City in July 2014. Taken together, these cases demonstrate how the Supreme Court has been an active participant in the effort to shield the Israeli government from any form of accountability, be it criminal or civil.

When an Israeli soldier shot Mr. Nabaheen in the neck, it was the status quo. There was no active war, and yet the daily situation was dire for Palestinians. Even so-called perfect victims like Attiya Nabaheen — 15, unarmed, on his family’s land, and shot during a cease-fire — could not pass the legal muster of the Israeli system or prevail over the violent bureaucracy of the law.

Mr. Nabaheen’s life and death encapsulate the Palestinian search for undelivered justice, an ongoing nakba, meaning “catastrophe,” that has only intensified in the last month. So many Palestinians continue to suffer a similar fate to that of Mr. Nabaheen, falling victim to the arbitrary brutality of Israeli shelling. As I write this, more than 9,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the Gazan health ministry. Many of them, like Mr. Nabaheen, had already survived several wars before finally succumbing to this one. And like Mr. Nabaheen, there will likely be no recognition or recourse for their tragedies. There will be no meaningful avenues through which their families can seek justice.

The last three weeks have brought with them daily news of death and destruction. Since the war began, I have not been able to reach any member of the Nabaheen family, despite trying three different phone numbers. As I’m writing these lines, my texts to my client’s brother from over a week ago still display one checkmark on WhatsApp, indicating they were not delivered. I wake each day worried about how many more people will be added to the death toll as the specter of genocide hangs over Gaza.

Nothing could have prepared me for the moment I learned that Mr. Nabaheen had been killed. Something in me died that day. His story unveils a systemic design that devalues Palestinian lives: The 16-year Israeli blockade on the Gaza Strip has always been lethal, even when so-called calm is restored, and Palestinian civilians always pay the steepest price.

Mr. Nabaheen’s life and death are reminders that the only status quo we should accept is one where the siege is lifted and the occupation has ended. A status quo of freedom."
322,322,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/world/middleeast/gaza-war-nasser-hospital.html,"“Red!” “Yellow!” “Green!”

The air at Nasser Hospital is pierced by the cries of medical workers getting their first look at patients coming in from a city under siege. Red is not good. It is for the most seriously wounded people, but even the other codes offer little comfort in a hospital stripped of the most basic necessities.

It is generally very difficult to learn much about the patients I photograph. In this case, the man with the medical forms on him was said to have been pulled from the rubble. What was his name? I do not know. Did he survive? I do not know that, either.

But he appeared to have two things possibly going in his favor: He was a Green. And he was given a space, if only on the floor. The hospital cannot afford to waste time on those who clearly won’t make it.

It is hard to convey the horror that is Nasser Hospital these days.

Everything is a blur. People running, people screaming. Doctors and nurses rushing from patient to patient. Family members desperately looking for the missing, hoping someone can stop and help them.

Every sense is assaulted.

The smell is very difficult. It is like burned skin, or perhaps charred tires mixed with the odor of blood and flesh. It’s a very strange and specific smell — and I fear it may never leave me.

Earlier in the war, the hospital was busy, but things appeared manageable. Then came a flood of refugees, as the Israel military, preparing a ground invasion, warned civilians in the north to evacuate.

The other day I found myself next to a doctor who was saying that before the war, the hospital used to cap daily admissions at 700. “Today, on a regular day without shelling, we accept more than 2,000 cases,” the doctor said.

Like many hospitals in Gaza, fuel shortages tied to the Israeli and Egyptian blockade have left Nasser struggling to keep the lights on and the equipment running. Critically needed food and medical supplies are said to be trickling into the territory, but when I ask the staff at Nasser about it, they tell me: “We haven’t received anything.”

And so children come in shivering with fever, and with no acetaminophen, little can be done for them. I often pass by the pediatric unit, and it is always full.

This is all I can tell you. This is what I have seen with my own eyes."

My name is Lydia Polgreen, and I’m an Opinion columnist for The New York Times and co-host of the “Matter of Opinion” podcast. I also spent many years as a foreign correspondent for The New York Times, working in Africa and Asia. And I spent a fair amount of time in war zones and in conflict situations over those years.

A few weeks ago, Patrick Healy, who’s the deputy opinion editor, had suggested to me that I might want to take a look through some of the images that we typically wouldn’t publish that are in the database of photographs that The New York Times has access to. This is a database that includes, basically, all of the wire photographers and different contributors to The New York Times. They’re all professional images from photojournalists, but they’re sort of unfiltered.

And one of the big and important decisions that you make, particularly if you’re in a leadership position at a news organization, is deciding what is acceptable to publish and what is not. And these are very difficult and sensitive decisions. So I’ve sort of plunged into these images. And what I noticed was that there were a lot of really, really hard to look at, very graphic images of injured and dead children among these photographs.

And as I was going through this, I found myself and I really sort of felt that I wanted to look away with most of these photographs. They were just really, really hard to look at. I think that I kind of was disassociating, in some ways, a little bit as I was going through these images. And then sort of out of the corner of my eye, this one image that had popped up on the screen really captured my attention.

This photo was taken by a Palestinian photographer in Gaza named Mahmud Hams. He’s a staff photographer for Agence France-Presse. And I thought as I looked at it, wow, this image actually looks like it could be from a slumber party, or it could be a bunch of children on a camping trip. And if you’re not looking at it closely, it almost looks like a kind of pastoral scene.

But then you notice that in the upper right-hand corner of the image, there is this drying smear of blood. And then you see that the children are all injured in various ways. And then you realize that the children are all dead when you look at the caption. It’s clear that this is a group of children who have been placed on the floor of a morgue, and they’re underneath a white sheet.

There was something about this image that I just really couldn’t look away from. And I really thought a lot about what is it about this image. And I think that there were a couple of things. One, that moment where you feel this sense of misapprehension that this could be children sleeping. And in fact, when you look at it closely, you realize, actually, none of them look like they’re sleeping. They all look dead, except for one child, a girl who’s in the middle of the frame, and her head is slightly tilted, and it almost looks like she’s kind of, in her sleep, whispering something to the child sleeping beside her.

I think the human mind is incredibly good at protecting itself from traumatic things, right? And so there is this kind of eyes glazing over dissociation that happens when you’re looking at a lot of images of this type. As it happens, like Susan Sontag wrote about this in her 1977 book “On Photography,” where she basically says that seeing a lot of graphic imagery has the power to kind of anesthetize us and inure us.

So even if your goal is to show the full horror of war, sometimes by showing graphic images, you’re actually kind of, like, dulling that sense. And I could actually feel that happening to me as I was looking at these images, until I came upon this image. And suddenly, my attention kind of snapped back, and I became very curious about what it is about an image that can seize us out of that moment of disassociation and pull us into attention and get us to see and be able to look at difficult things.

And this photograph, I guess, I thought of it as a photograph that had a kind of iconic quality not unlike the photograph of the girl who was burned by napalm during the Vietnam War. I thought of the iconic photograph of Emmett Till. Emmett Till was lynched in 1955, and his mother had insisted that his body be placed in an open casket and photographed, and that it be seen around the world so that the world would have to answer for what had happened to him.

And so those are the images that sort of came to my mind, and I thought, does this image kind of clear that hurdle? And I felt that this image really sort of said something powerful about war, and about this war in particular, and about the toll that it’s taking on children in Gaza. And as I looked more at this image, I thought, I need to write about this picture.

And as I started writing about it, I realized, I actually think that people should see this picture. And I knew that that was not going to be an easy thing to make happen because having been the editor of a publication, I was editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post at one stage, and I’ve been an editor at The New York Times on the international desk, and you make these really difficult decisions about what to show and what not to show. And they are truly wrenching, wrenching, wrenching decisions.

I think the question of whether or not to publish this image is a really difficult one. For me as an individual columnist, I argued passionately that we should publish it and that people should see it. And we had a lot of debates internally about it. The leaders of The Times, including our opinion editor, Katie Kingsbury, made very thoughtful counterarguments, and ultimately, the responsibility lies with Katie in making these decisions. And so I accept her decision and respect it.

And I think one of the big questions is these children’s faces are recognizable. And you’re thinking about their families. You’re thinking about the impact that could have on their families, our inability to reach their families, to talk to them about it and get their consent. And I think that intelligent people, caring people, can disagree on these questions. I think ultimately, making a link to the image available so that people who did want to see it, could see it, was the sort of compromise position that we ended on.

So as a kind of baseline, I think that writing about documenting, trying to tell these stories, is a way to say, I’m not OK with this. What I’m seeing is not something that I can accept. It’s not something that I can live with. And that might seem like a pretty feeble outcome or protest or way to take an action, but what I like about that way of thinking is that it doesn’t overpromise what can be achieved, but it makes the moral obligation absolutely crystal clear we don’t underwrite what’s happening here."
324,324,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/business/media/fox-news-jews-israel.html,"As CNN and MSNBC went live on Tuesday with breaking news that Israel had bombed the Jabaliya neighborhood, the site of the largest refugee center in Gaza, an entirely different scene was playing on Fox News: a segment from southern Israel reporting that two Israeli soldiers had been killed in battle and two others wounded.

There are no specific metrics available on the religious affiliation of Fox’s audience since Oct. 7, the day Hamas first attacked Israel. But ratings data from major metropolitan areas with large Jewish populations, including New York, Miami and Los Angeles, show a spike in viewership that outpaces its rivals.

Since September, Fox News’s audience has grown by a larger percentage than CNN and MSNBC in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington and Miami. And in the New York market — the nation’s largest — Fox has lately beaten its left-leaning rival, MSNBC, by a few percentage points. In September, Fox was drawing 16 percent fewer viewers than MSNBC in New York.

Fox News — with the largest audience in all of cable television in recent years — draws a sizable number of Democratic and liberal-leaning viewers. Among viewers who are 25 to 54, the demographic most important to advertisers, Fox News had more people who identify as Democrats watching in prime time than either CNN or MSNBC, according to Nielsen data through August.

Critics of Israel have noticed Fox’s coverage, with some calling the network “Zionist propagandists” while mocking its coverage as turning a blind eye to Palestinian casualties. (One Fox story that recently came under attack featured a puppy who needed a home after his Israeli owners were killed in the Hamas assault.)

Some Jews who paid little attention to the conservative network in the past are now tuning in — and surprising themselves. In an interview with The Free Press, an outlet that has been critical of mainstream coverage of Israel, one liberal Jewish woman from Minneapolis said, “My friends and I are like, ‘My God, we find ourselves watching clips on Fox News.’”

One liberal Fox host, Jessica Tarlov, said in a recent appearance on “Real Time With Bill Maher” that her pro-Israel perspective put her out of step with younger Democrats but not with many of her fellow older millennials, some of whom recently started watching Fox News.

“My Jewish liberal friends will text me and they’ll say, ‘Oh, this is where you go in the afternoon?’ because they never watched Fox before,” she said.

Fox anchors, especially those who offer the most steadfast defense of Israel on their shows, insist that they are shining a light on reports of antisemitism that other media overlook and are displaying support for an American ally that is being wrongly vilified."
325,325,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/opinion/israel-hamas-gaza-war-politics.html,"It’s been a long time since the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians occupied such a central place in Western political attention and debate — certainly not since the Israeli invasion of Gaza in 2009, arguably not since the second intifada ended in 2005.

In that fairly distant past, the politics of Israel-Palestine broke down into alignments that were familiar and decades-old. On the pro-Israel side in the U.S. were three broad factions: Zionist Democrats, centrist and liberal; neoconservative hawks; and evangelical Christians. As you moved leftward, sympathy for the Palestinians increased, with American progressives and European conventional wisdom finding common ground in their critiques of the Israeli occupation. Finally there was also a rightward form of anti-Israel sentiment, held by Arabist realists and Pat Buchananite populists and European reactionaries — but in the aftermath of 9/11, with neoconservatism ascendant, this felt increasingly marginal.

These broad groupings still exist — evangelicals are still very pro-Israel, the Democratic president is a Zionist liberal, the progressive movement is pro-Palestinian — but in the current crisis you can see a more complex alignment taking shape, with implications that extend beyond the Israeli-Palestinian question alone. Here, very provisionally, are some ideological trends and tendencies worth watching.

The radicalization of progressivism. Nobody who has lived through the last decade’s Great Awokening should be surprised that Western progressivism now has a more radical line on Israel than it did 10 or 15 years ago, especially given Israel’s own rightward shift in that same time. But the extent to which the rhetoric of “decolonization” turns out to naturally extend — or, maybe, naturally circle back — from cultural and psychological projects to literal support for armed struggle and tacit apologia for antisemitic terror still feels like an important unveiling, a revelation of radicalization’s implications, a doorway into a future much more violently divided than our own.

The emergence of an “Arab street” inside the West. In the post-9/11 era, we were accustomed to think of popular discontent inside Arab and Muslim countries as an important geopolitical force in its own right. But 2023 may be remembered as the moment when Arab and Muslim discontent began to really matter inside Western countries as well.

The recent protests in European capitals, especially, are less an extension of a radicalized progressivism than a straightforward expression of ethnic and religious solidarity with the Palestinians on the part of Middle Eastern immigrants and their descendants. And the tacit alliance between this diaspora and a secular, feminist, gay-affirming Western progressivism — “Islamo-gauchisme” in the French phrase — raises big questions for both progressives and conservative Muslims about who is using whom and how the Western left and Western Islam might ultimately co-evolve.

The unstable European relationship to Israel. In one sense, the mass movements protesting on Palestine’s behalf in European streets would seem likely to ratify the pre-existing anti-Israel tilt of many European leaders. But if Europe is moving rightward overall, becoming more doubtful about mass immigration, more fearful of Islamicization and terrorism and more protective of its native culture as it slides toward old age — well, then, you could easily imagine European sympathy for the Israeli position increasing, with fear of an Islamist enemy within driving identification with Israel abroad.

And indeed signs of this are visible already: The British writer Aris Roussinos recently observed that commentary in Britain now seems even a little more sympathetic to Israel than American commentary, while across the Channel, Emmanuel Macron’s attempts to rally a grand anti-Hamas coalition and his government’s ban on pro-Palestinian demonstrations belong to a very different landscape from the world of 2005.

The dilemmas of progressive Jews and Zionist Democrats. If the pressures on European elites come from multiple directions, the pressures on American Jews and Zionists inside the Democratic coalition push just one way: toward the right. Progressive Jews who thought of themselves as pro-peace, pro-Palestinian and anti-Likud are going to have a lot of trouble feeling at home inside a progressive movement that seems conflicted or paralyzed when it’s asked to condemn Hamas. Zionist liberals who are closer to the political center can take comfort that their worldview is still shared by most of the Democratic Party’s politicians, including the Democratic president. But the leftward ratchet in Democratic politics has been a powerful force, and generational turnover means that progressive activists may get a chance to reshape the party in their own image before long. At which point, where might Zionist Democrats go, if not toward actual conservatism?

A reconstituted neoconservatism, a resilient Christian Zionism. One thing that liberal supporters of Israel will find if they move rightward, indeed a thing that some are already helping to create, is a new variation on neoconservatism. This isn’t the George W. Bush-era version, with its world-bestriding confidence in American power and its hawkish grand strategy. Rather, it’s a more inchoate alliance against whatever progressivism is becoming. Many of its members still feel uncomfortable associating with a Trumpist G.O.P., but they’re too intensely alienated from progressivism to belong to the left-of-center coalition any more. This makes it a movement more like 1970s-era neoconservatism — a mugged-by-reality halfway house for intellectuals unhappy with their options but trending clearly to the right."
326,326,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/opinion/antisemitism-israel-lipstadt.html,"When the historian Deborah Lipstadt defeated a libel suit brought against her in a British court by the Holocaust denier David Irving in April 2000, it was almost possible to imagine that antisemitism might someday become a thing of the past, at least in much of the West. Taking a trip to Israel was not an ideologically fraught choice. Wearing a Star of David was not a personally risky one. College campuses did not feel hostile to Jewish students. Synagogues (at least in the United States) did not have police officers stationed outside their doors.

Not anymore.

The Anti-Defamation League recorded 751 antisemitic incidents in the United States in 2013. There were 3,697 in 2022. There was a nearly 400 percent increase in the two weeks after the Hamas massacre of Oct. 7 compared with the year before. Last week, “Jewish students specifically were warned not to enter M.I.T.’s front entrance due to a risk to their physical safety,” according to a public letter from Jewish students there. In Montreal a Jewish school was targeted by gunfire twice in a single week.

Today, Lipstadt is the U.S. special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism, and her battle against Irving (the subject of the 2016 film “Denial”) seems almost quaint. “I never imagined antisemitism would get this bad,” she told me when I spoke with her by phone on Monday evening. “Something about this is different from anything I have ever personally seen.”

One of those differences, I suggested, is that antisemitism is the hate that doesn’t know its own name — that is, that many of those who call themselves anti-Zionists or chant “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” would vehemently deny that they are engaged in antisemitic behavior."
327,327,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/us/politics/haley-desantis-trump-fact-check.html,"WHAT WAS SAID

“DeSantis gave millions to Chinese companies. DeSantis even voted to fast-track Obama’s Chinese trade deals.”

— A pro-Haley super PAC, SFA Fund Inc., in an ad

False. There is no evidence Mr. DeSantis directly gave “millions” to Chinese companies; the ad was referring to technology purchases by state agencies. And the trade-related vote in question, when Mr. DeSantis was in Congress, did not result in the Obama administration signing trade deals with China.

In regards to the claim that Mr. DeSantis gave millions to Chinese companies, a representative for the super PAC cited a 2020 article in The Washington Times, a conservative publication. The article concerned a report that asserted that state governments around the country were introducing security threats because of technology contracts with two companies: Lexmark, which was acquired by a Chinese consortium in 2016, and Lenovo, a Chinese tech company. Both companies disputed the report in statements to the news outlet.

Florida records do show state agencies have spent millions in purchases from the companies, mostly Lexmark, for printers and other products, since Mr. DeSantis took office on Jan. 8, 2019. South Carolina has also worked with the companies, including under Ms. Haley’s governorship.

Florida used those companies before Mr. DeSantis’s tenure, too, and SFA Fund provided no evidence that Mr. DeSantis himself directly approved the purchases. Last year, Mr. DeSantis issued an executive order instructing state officials to create rules to prevent state entities from buying technology that presents security risks, including because of a connection to China or other “foreign countries of concern.”

The ad’s contention that Mr. DeSantis “voted to fast-track Obama’s Chinese trade deals” is similarly flawed. It is based on a vote Mr. DeSantis made as a congressman in 2015 to extend the president’s authority to fast-track trade legislation. He was among 190 Republicans in the House to vote for it.

But Mark Wu, a Harvard law professor with expertise in international trade, said no trade agreements subject to that authority were made with China.

“In passing T.P.A. in 2015, Congress agreed only to fast-track trade agreements that addressed tariff barriers (along with possibly nontariff barriers),” Mr. Wu said in an email, referring to the trade promotion authority bill that bolstered the president’s power to negotiate trade deals with Asia and Europe. “None of the negotiations that the U.S. conducted with China during the Obama administration fell into this category. Nor did these negotiations result in any trade deals with China during the Obama administration.”

WHAT WAS SAID

“Ron, you are the chair of your economic development agency that, as of last week, said Florida is the ideal place for Chinese businesses. Not only that, you have a company that is manufacturer of Chinese military planes. You have it. They are expanding two training sites at two of your airports now, one which is 12 miles away from a naval base. Then you have another company that’s expanding, and they were just invaded by the Department of Homeland Security.”

— Ms. Haley during the debate last week

This requires context. Mr. DeSantis previously served as the board chairman of a public-private economic development organization known as Enterprise Florida. The governor signed legislation earlier this year that consolidated the organization’s work into what is now the state’s Commerce Department.

Ms. Haley was referring to an old report. A 2019-2020 report by Enterprise Florida described Florida as “an ideal business destination for Chinese companies.” Ms. Haley’s campaign has hit Mr. DeSantis over reports that the document was taken down this month.

Ms. Haley’s other points largely check out.

In October last year, Cirrus Aircraft — which was acquired in 2011 by a Chinese state-owned company that makes military aircraft — announced it had expanded locations at the Orlando Executive Airport and Kissimmee Gateway Airport. The first location provides aircraft sales and concierge flight training, while the other offers aircraft maintenance and management. The Orlando complex is less than 10 miles from a Navy training systems center.

Regarding the company raided by the Homeland Security Department, Ms. Haley was referring to a solar panel company, JinkoSolar, based in China. Homeland security officials in May executed search warrants at its factory in Jacksonville, Fla., and an office in California.

While federal officials have not provided details on that inquiry, it appears to be linked to multiple concerns. Those include whether JinkoSolar misrepresented the source of some imports containing materials from the Xinjiang region of China and incorrectly classified products, resulting in an incorrect duty rate, The New York Times has reported. The company has said that it is confident in its supply chain traceability and that U.S. customs officials have reviewed and released JinkoSolar products.

In June, Jacksonville’s City Council withdrew a bill that would have provided the company tax incentives to expand. A JinkoSolar representative said in a statement that the company still planned to pursue its $50 million expansion.

WHAT WAS SAID

“Nikki Haley promised South Carolina she would never support increasing taxes on gas. She broke that promise almost immediately.”

— A pro-DeSantis super PAC, Never Back Down, in a post on X last week

This is misleading. As governor, Ms. Haley rebuffed calls to increase South Carolina’s gas tax as a stand-alone measure.

The ad included in the post features clips taken from Ms. Haley’s State of the State addresses. First she is shown saying, in 2013, “But I will not, not now, not ever, support raising the gas tax.” She is then shown in 2015 saying, “Let’s increase the gas tax by 10 cents over the next three years.”

But Ms. Haley’s full 2015 remarks shows that the super PAC took her comments out of context. She first acknowledged that “some have advocated raising the state gas tax” to increase revenue for infrastructure projects and later said: “As I’ve said many times, I will veto any straight-up increase in the gas tax.”

Instead, Ms. Haley said she would only support a gas tax increase if the state reduced the income tax rate to 5 percent, from 7 percent, and made changes to the state’s Department of Transportation.

The state did not ultimately increase the gas tax under Ms. Haley."

Most did not die in the line of duty but instead while at home, often in strikes that also killed members of their families, U.N. officials said.

They were men and women. The largest number were teachers. Others included school principals, warehouse workers, engineers, a software developer, a gynecologist and a man in charge of staff safety. He was killed in his home along with his wife and their eight children, said Juliette Touma, the director of communications for UNRWA, the agency that cares for Palestinian refugees and their descendants across the Middle East.

“It is a huge, huge loss,” Ms. Touma said. “Every day, we get more of these reports of our colleagues who were killed.”

The UNRWA employees, all Palestinians, have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, when Hamas, which controls the enclave, launched a deadly surprise attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and capturing another approximately 240 as hostages, Israeli officials say. The Israeli military responded with a punishing air campaign and ground incursions into Gaza that health authorities there say have killed more than 11,000 people, including thousands of children."
330,330,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/arts/design/islamic-exhibition-postponed-frick-pittsburgh.html,"The Frick Pittsburgh postponed an exhibition featuring 10 centuries of Islamic art that was supposed to open on Saturday, citing the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war and the fear that the show could become “a source of unintended insensitivity or offense.”

The decision to postpone the show, which was to include scientific instruments, fine glassware, paintings and metalwork from across the Middle East, was denounced by some Muslim and Jewish groups, who said that the museum’s action seemed to suggest or imply a false connection between masterpieces of Islamic art and terrorism.

The postponement was reported earlier by The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, which noted that the museum initially said on its website only that the delay had been due to “a scheduling conflict.” The museum’s executive director, Elizabeth Barker, told The Tribune-Review that “we realized that we were about to open an exhibition that a forgiving person would call insensitive, but for many people, especially in our community, would be traumatic.”

Christine Mohamed, the executive director of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement that the “decision to postpone the ‘Treasured Ornament: 10 Centuries of Islamic Art’ exhibition under the pretext of potential harm to the Jewish community perpetuates the harmful stereotype that Muslims or Islamic art are synonymous with terrorism or antisemitism.”

And Adam Hertzman, an official with the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, told the radio station WESA that “few people in the Jewish community would have been concerned about an exhibit on Islamic art because we understand that has nothing to do with Hamas, which is a terrorist organization.”

The Tribune-Review reported that Ms. Barker had written an email to the museum’s staff on Oct. 11 saying that she wanted to discuss the exhibition “given the war in Israel and the inflammatory anti-Islamic rhetoric related to the current political environment.” In a statement Thursday, Ms. Barker said that the decision to postpone “was motivated by concerns that it trivializes and risks objectifying Islamic culture as merely decorative and was prepared without the Frick’s characteristic engagement with broad community partners, in this case the Pittsburgh Muslim community.”

The decision to postpone came as Pittsburgh was preparing to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue, which killed 11 worshipers and wounded six more in the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history.

The museum later updated its website with a fuller explanation of the delay, noting that it had been planned years in advance. “At the time of scheduling,” it said, “it would have been impossible to predict that war would erupt in the Middle East during the time of this show, prompting widespread heartbreak and mounting social tension.”

The museum said that the exhibition, in its existing form, “lacked sufficient historical and cultural context” and that it “also lacked participation from the regional Islamic community and others.”

“Presenting the show as originally conceived elsewhere, years ago, risked trivializing Islamic culture at an extraordinarily complex time and turning an intended educational opportunity into a divisive political touchstone, a source of unintended insensitivity or offense, and a distraction from our important service to the entire community,” it said.

It was not the first time that a museum has pulled an exhibition in recent years at a time of rising tensions.

In 2020, amid the racial justice protests that followed the killing of George Floyd, four major museums — the National Gallery of Art in Washington; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; the Tate Modern in London and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston — postponed a show of the artist Philip Guston, saying that his works, which included charged imagery of hooded Ku Klux Klan figures, needed more context. The postponement was criticized by many artists who accused the museums of shying away from controversy.

Late Thursday evening, a museum representative said the exhibition would be rescheduled to open in August 2024. The postponed exhibition was organized by the nonprofit International Arts and Artists, which created it on behalf of the Huntington Museum of Art in West Virginia.

“There is nothing wrong with the exhibition; I think the timing was not right for them,” Gregory Houston, president and chief executive of the nonprofit International Arts and Artists, said of the Pittsburgh museum. “We will work with them to reimagine it in the context they deem appropriate.”

Geoffrey K. Fleming, the executive director of the Huntington, said that “every museum has to make its own decisions regarding what is going on with their shows and world affairs” but that he would “love to see it at some point at the Frick Pittsburgh so that people can enjoy the exhibition.”

Walter B. Denny, a retired professor of Islamic art who helped prepare a publication related to the exhibition, said the collection was supposed to help people understand the diversity of Islamic art, and said that it included works by Muslims, Jews and Christians.

“There is a great irony here,” Denny said by phone. “The collection is so far away from anything that is remotely political or sympathetic to fanaticism.”"

Hamas has said that other groups are holding some of the hostages, but it is not clear how many.

Mr. Biden has said that freeing the hostages is a top priority, and administration officials have said the United States is actively engaged in indirect negotiations involving Israel, Qatar and Hamas to secure their release.

Al-Shifa, Gaza’s main hospital complex, has been cut off from electricity for days. Hospital officials warn that the lives of roughly three dozen premature babies are under threat now that the incubators needed to keep them alive are without power.

As the fighting drew closer to Al-Shifa last week, many of the more than 60,000 people sheltering at the hospital complex have fled, according to the Gaza health ministry. But the babies’ fragile health makes moving them difficult, complicating Israel’s stated goal of emptying the complex of civilians before its troops try to enter. Israeli and U.S. officials say the hospital hosts an underground Hamas command center, a claim that Hamas and hospital officials reject.

The Israeli military said late Monday that it was working to deliver mobile incubators and respirators to help evacuate the babies. The Times was unable to reach the hospital director or the Gaza health ministry to ask about Israel’s offer, the details of which remained unclear.

Here’s the latest.

Persuading a watching world: Israel released videos from inside Gaza’s main children’s hospital that it claimed showed weapons and explosives found in the medical center, and a basement room where the military said hostages were kept. The assertions could not be independently verified, and the Gazan health ministry said the basement rooms shown were used as shelters “for those fleeing airstrikes.”"
336,336,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/world/middleeast/israel-hostages-march-jerusalem-tel-aviv.html,"For 10 days, Noam Alon, 24, has camped in front of the central military headquarters in Tel Aviv, aiming to pressure the Israeli government to do more to bring back his girlfriend of a year and a half, Inbar Heiman, and the more than 200 other hostages currently held in Gaza.

But with no news on when and whether the captives will be released, Mr. Alon has grown impatient with the Israeli government and is moving on from the spot where he and some 30 others have been sleeping. “We won’t sit silent,” he said.

On Tuesday, Mr. Alon joined members of the families of about 50 hostages and supporters — a total of about 100 people — who plan to march for five days from Tel Aviv, on the Mediterranean coast, to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office in Jerusalem, setting up camp each night along the way.

Carrying water bottles and sleeping bags, the group marched off from a square across from the military headquarters, chanting “Bring them home now!”

Mr. Alon, like many others at the march, wants Mr. Netanyahu and his cabinet to do everything they can to secure the release of those abducted by Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups in the Oct. 7 attack that the Israeli government says killed 1,200 people.

“We think the Israeli government should pay any price,” Mr. Alon said, whether that entails a prisoner exchange, a cease-fire or fuel delivery. The hostages’ lives are in the government’s hands, he said. Mr. Netanyahu, who has made clear that Israel’s goal is to eradicate Hamas, has maintained that a cease-fire would be contingent on the release of hostages.

In late October, Israeli forces rescued one hostage, and four others were released by Hamas about a week earlier. But, despite negotiation efforts led by the United States and Qatar, there have been no further breakthroughs on a hostage release deal. Families of the hostages have organized rallies over the past two weeks that have drawn thousands to the military headquarters.

Despite the outpouring of public support, those with family members and friends held captive in Gaza are feeling frustrated.

“I’m tired of sitting around,” said Yuval Haran, 36, from Be’eri, a kibbutz near the border with Gaza that was heavily attacked on Oct. 7. He has seven family members being held hostage in Gaza and was an organizer of the march. “I want to start walking to where the decisions are made.”

The marchers, who range in age from their 20s to their 70s, will walk about 10 miles a day along main highways, sleeping each night in campsites on the side of the road. They are filling one lane of the highway, with police escorts, support staff and vans carrying gear taking up another.

Shelly Shem Tov, 51, whose son Omer, 21, was abducted from the Nova festival, joined the march to try to galvanize popular support and pressure Mr. Netanyahu. She also sees leaving her comfort zone, by marching on foot to Jerusalem, as an opportunity to identify on a personal level with her son, who is in “a place I can’t even imagine,” she said.

On Monday, Hamas released a video of a hostage who the group claims was killed by an Israeli airstrike, raising concerns among the families that Israel’s military operations in Gaza are threatening hostages’ lives.

In July, protesters against Mr. Netanyahu’s judicial overhaul organized a similar five-day march from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The families of the hostages have described the march as apolitical, but Avi Gur Arye, 73, who joined as a supporter, said that it would be a boon if the movement also contributes to a change in government, which he said is “dividing and unraveling the fabric of this country” after the war.

Mr. Alon said that he wants to be optimistic that the marchers won’t need to walk all the way. He said he hoped that during the march, “Everyone will tell us, ‘Stop walking. They are here.’”"

Digitally doctored images that whip around social media before they can be verified. Accusations — since rejected by multiple news outlets — that photojournalists had advance knowledge of the Hamas surprise attack on Oct. 7.

The visual chronicle of the war between Israel and Hamas has become its own disturbing case study of the age of disinformation, when photographs, and the act of photojournalism itself, are weaponized by both sides of a highly charged conflict. For newsrooms in the United States and Europe, the question of which images to publish — and which are too graphic or misleading to be published — has rarely been more complex.

“In every war, there is a war of narratives,” said Jonathan Levy, the executive editor of Sky News. “You’ve got to be really mindful, not just of the potential harm to the audience of being exposed to some of that imagery, but also how you manage it.”

In interviews, editors at newspapers, TV stations and wire agencies said they had devoted countless hours in recent weeks to what many said was ultimately a delicate judgment call: deciding what their audiences saw and heard about the war. Among the factors is how much horror a viewer or reader can tolerate, and whether an image sensationalizes or trivializes violence. News outlets also feel a responsibility to victims and their families, who may not be aware that a relative has been killed or badly injured.

“You want to get the most realistic view of what’s happening on the ground; you want to show the pictures,” said Greg Headen, who oversees domestic and international coverage at Fox News. “In many cases, though, we cannot. Some of the images we have seen are so gruesome, they can’t even be described on TV.”

Some footage is so traumatic, Mr. Headen added, that to air it would render viewers numb to the spoken words accompanying the video: “The bottom line is, they’re not going to hear a word your reporter said.”"

The youngest is not even a year old; the oldest is 14. All are battling lymphoma, leukemia and tumors that doctors said could kill them if left untreated.

Over the past 10 days, 21 children with cancer have been evacuated from Gaza to hospitals in Egypt and Jordan, according to doctors involved in the effort. But at least 30 other young cancer patients have not made it out, and aid workers said that in the chaos of war, they can no longer reach some of the families.

“This is catastrophic,” said Dr. Bakr Gaoud, the head of Al-Rantisi Specialized Hospital for Children, which was the only medical center with a pediatric cancer ward in Gaza until it was forced to shut down on Friday during heavy fighting. Even before the hospital closed, critically ill patients were being sent home through violent streets or transferred to Al-Shifa, a nearby hospital that is under siege by Israeli forces.

Hospitals have become a particular flash point in the war as Israel has accused Hamas of turning medical facilities, including Al-Rantisi and Al-Shifa, into safe houses and command centers. Hamas and hospital officials have denied the allegations.

The effort to evacuate children with cancer began in mid-October and required negotiations among the White House, Egypt, Israel and Palestinian health officials in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas.

But those involved in the evacuation said it has proceeded fitfully.

Aid workers and doctors, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the efforts, described frantic families who lost their cell service and missed the specific days when their children had been given permission to cross into Egypt. Some waited for hours for ambulances that never made it to a meeting point."

Because her body was not initially found in the ashes of her home, which had been set on fire, her friends and family thought she was missing.

The Israeli government believes that more than 230 hostages taken on Oct. 7 are held in Gaza, including children and older people from several countries.

340,340,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/briefing/al-shifa-hospital-gaza.html,"The battle over Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza highlights a tension that often goes unmentioned in the debate over the war between Israel and Hamas: There may be no way for Israel both to minimize civilian casualties and to eliminate Hamas.

The reality of this trade-off still doesn’t answer the question of what should happen in Gaza. Some people will conclude that the human cost, in the lives of innocent Palestinians, does not justify removing Hamas from power — or that Israel may be undermining its own interests by trying to dismantle Hamas. Others will conclude that Hamas’s recent killings of innocent Israelis and its repeated vows to destroy Israel represent a threat that no country would accept on its border.

Nonetheless, Al-Shifa — a major hospital that includes a neonatal department — highlights the lack of simple answers in Gaza, and I want to use today’s newsletter to explain.

Hamas and hospitals

There is substantial evidence that Hamas has used the hospital for military operations and has built a command center underneath it as part of Gaza’s tunnel network:

A New York Times journalist in 2008 watched armed Hamas militants walking around Al-Shifa Hospital in civilian clothes and witnessed Hamas execute a Palestinian man accused of collaborating with Israel.

Amnesty International concluded that in 2014 Hamas used parts of Al-Shifa “to detain, interrogate, torture and otherwise ill-treat suspects, even as other parts of the hospital continued to function as a medical center.”

More recently, Israel has released audio recordings that purport to contain conversations in which Hamas fighters discuss tunnels under Al-Shifa as well as videos of interrogations in which captured militants discuss the tunnels.

Israeli officials allowed Times reporters to view photographs that appear to show secret entrances inside the hospital that lead to a military compound underneath.

U.S. officials say their own intelligence also indicates Hamas has built a tunnel network under Al-Shifa that includes command and control areas as well as weapons storage.

Hamas has a long history of placing its operations in hospitals, mosques and other civilian areas so that Israel must risk killing innocent bystanders — and thereby damage its reputation — to attack Hamas fighters. “I’ve seen these things for myself,” Steven Erlanger, a longtime Times correspondent, has said on “The Daily” podcast.

Hamas denies that it uses civilians as shields, and two Norwegian doctors who have worked in Gaza have backed its denials. The head of Al-Shifa Hospital, Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, has also said Hamas does not operate there. He told The Times last week that Israeli allegations were “untrue.”

But it’s worth remembering that officials with the Gaza Health Ministry have had a problematic record in recent weeks: On Oct. 17, they claimed that Israel was responsible for an explosion at another hospital and said the explosion killed about 500 people. Both claims appear to be false, as I have explained. A Palestinian rocket was the likely cause, according to U.S., Canadian and French officials, and the death toll appears to have been much lower.

The situation with Al-Shifa seems similar: Outsiders cannot know the truth for certain (at least until cameras are allowed inside the hospital and the tunnels underneath it), but the Israeli claims have much more evidence behind them than Hamas’s claims."
341,341,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/world/middleeast/international-law-israel-hamas.html,"It has been 26 days since Hamas launched its attacks on Israel. In my column a few days after the conflict began, I said that international law offered a framework for analyzing what was happening, even while the atrocities committed by Hamas were still being documented, and as the consequences of Israel’s devastating airstrikes on Gaza and cutoff of food, water and fuel were beginning to unfold.

I stand by that. But I also know that for many readers, the events of the weeks since — the rising civilian death toll in Gaza, the continued holding of hostages by Hamas, and the seeming inability of world leaders to agree on a way to protect civilians — pose a profound and vexing question: Is there actually a point to these laws if it’s so hard to enforce them?

Yes. But like any tool, international law has limitations as well as strengths. I’m going to dig into those by trying to answer some of the broad questions I’ve heard from readers and other commentators.

If a wartime attack kills innocent people, how could it be legal?

The laws of war are not designed to outlaw fighting completely, or even to ban all killings of civilians. Rather, they set minimum requirements for a situation in which our usual moral rules (for instance, “Don’t kill other human beings”) have already been suspended and our usual ways for resolving disagreements have failed. In practical terms, as sad as it is, that means that acts of war can be horrifying without necessarily being illegal."
342,342,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/world/middleeast/hezbollah-hassan-nasrallah-israel-hamas.html,"Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, will break his public silence on the war in Gaza on Friday in a televised speech that many in the region expect will provide insights into whether the group will escalate its battle with Israel.

Hezbollah is a Hamas ally that is also supported by Iran and committed to the destruction of Israel. Since Hamas’s surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7 and Israel’s subsequent bombing campaign and invasion of Gaza, fears have risen across the Middle East that Hezbollah will open a second front against Israel on its northern border, sparking a broader war.

Hezbollah, like Hamas, has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and other countries.

In recent weeks, Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in tit-for-tat shelling and missile attacks along the Lebanon-Israel border, although both sides appear to be calibrating their actions to avoid setting off a broader conflict.

Mr. Nasrallah, who often speaks to his followers in live addresses that are followed across the region, has not spoken publicly since before Oct. 7, raising expectations that he will make a significant announcement on Friday.

Fighting appeared to intensify along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon on Thursday. After a string of cross-border attacks throughout the day, Hezbollah and Hamas both claimed responsibility on Thursday evening for separate and heavy strikes into northern Israel. Israeli television aired footage showing the aftermath of the rocket attack on Israel’s northernmost city, Kiryat Shmona.

Earlier in the day, Hezbollah also said it had used explosive-packed drones to attack an Israeli army position in a disputed border area known as Shebaa Farms, the latest indication that it is attempting to use more of its arsenal.

The Israeli army’s response appeared to be swift and far-reaching, with Lebanon’s state-run news agency reporting that three civilians were killed. In a statement, the country’s military said it had targeted military infrastructure, command and control centers, weapons caches and military compounds belonging to Hezbollah.

To deter Iran, Hezbollah and other regional actors, the Biden administration has increased the U.S. military’s force posture in the region and has passed warnings to Iran and Hezbollah, through regional partners including Turkey, that the United States could intervene militarily against them if they launched attacks against Israel.

“It’s not in anyone’s interest — not in anyone’s interest — for this to escalate,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Thursday, before departing on his trip to the Middle East. “I think some of the other parties involved actually recognize that.”"

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today. To much of the outside world, Hamas’ decision to murder hundreds of Israelis and trigger a war that has since killed many thousands of its own people looks like a historic miscalculation, one that could soon result in the destruction of Hamas itself. My colleague Ben Hubbard has been reporting on that decision and the deliberate calculations that went into it. It’s Tuesday, November 14. Ben, since October 7, since Hamas breached Israel’s border and killed 1,200 people, according to Israel, the vast majority of them civilians, I think a really important question has largely gone unanswered, which is why? Why undertake such a horrifying terror attack that entailed the mass murder of non-combatants, and why do that when Hamas had to understand on some level that it would trigger an overwhelming reprisal from Israel that would end the lives of so many Palestinian civilians, which is exactly what’s happened? This was a highly planned and highly organized attack that clearly had a strategy behind it, so what was it?

ben hubbard

That’s what I set out to understand. After the attack, I think everybody was asking that question of why would Hamas, which is ruling in Gaza and has this control, and you know, why would they suddenly do something like this that was actually described by one of my colleagues as a suicide attack on itself? Like, basically was the movement trying to destroy itself? And so we wanted to figure out how did Hamas get to the point in terms of capabilities where it could launch this, which was a much, much more sophisticated and complicated attack than we had ever seen them carry out before, despite the decades and decades that they’ve been fighting Israel, and then also why? How did they get to the point where they made the decision that of the kinds of attacks that they could do for whatever it is that they wanted to achieve, why this? Not a very easy thing to answer.

michael barbaro

Right.

ben hubbard

It’s completely unrealistic that we would be able to call up the leaders of Hamas in Gaza who plotted and carried out this attack. I mean, certainly by the time that we were asking this question, they were hiding away in their bunkers somewhere getting ready to fight Israel, which was making it very clear it was going to do a ground incursion. So there’s sort of no way to talk to these people. But Hamas has leaders in other places. You have the people in Gaza who run the show there, and then they have people from their more political operations who are based in other parts of the Middle East. There’s a number of them who are in Beirut. There’s a number of them who are in Qatar. So I packed my bags and left Istanbul and first went to Beirut.

michael barbaro

With the understanding that you could meet with them, I think it would surprise people to think that you can just meet with the senior leaders of Hamas.

ben hubbard

Yeah. I mean, they’re sort of political people from any other political party. They have offices and they have aides, and you call them up, and you take an appointment, and you figure out where you’re going to meet them, and you go to the office. And so, we got in touch with a number of them, and they said, yeah, come in, and we’ll have a chat. And they told us to meet them at this restaurant that’s kind of well known in the suburbs of Beirut, and we actually got in their car, and they drove us to this sort of compound where we went in with a sort of big metal gate that opens when you go in. And we went in, and we just basically sat in a room with some couches, and we talked. And then a few days later, I went to Doha, capital of Qatar, sort of on the other side of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf. Again, we get in touch with the Hamas officials that we know are there, and the first person that we talked to was actually an aide to Ismail Haniyeh, who was the head of Hamas. And he says, well, let’s meet at the Sheraton, the hotel sort of on the waterfront. And so, I go there, and we meet and have a long chat with him, asking him basically all about the attack and before the attack and why the attack. And then we actually get in his car, and he drives us to the Hamas office. It’s in a nice villa in an affluent neighborhood, kind of on the outskirts of the city, has a big wall around it. No sign. No indication to anybody coming by sort of who was there or who works there. We meet one of the members of the senior leadership body, the Politburo, Khalil al-Hayya. And again, we’re sitting in a large room with couches, and somebody brings us tea and coffee, and we start talking.

michael barbaro

And after you have all these conversations with these leaders of Hamas, what did they tell you about this question of why? This question that you have come here to try to understand the logic of this attack, if we can apply that word to what happened.

ben hubbard

The basic idea that they all kept coming back to is they felt that the Palestinian cause was basically fading away, that there were aspects of this conflict that were approaching a point of no return, and if they sort of passed that point, then it was all over. And also this feeling that nobody really cared. Nobody was really paying attention or doing anything about it, including the Israelis, that the Israelis just didn’t even seem to be thinking about the Palestinian cause anymore. So they felt that they needed to do something big, they needed to do something dramatic to blow up the status quo. They wanted to completely overthrow the situation in the region, and individual leaders said that they hoped that this led to a big regional war, that that was the ideal outcome and hope that some new option would emerge from what came after.

michael barbaro

So what they’re telling you is they needed in their minds to light a fire, and not a small fire. They wanted to light a conflagration, and I’m wondering if that means for them that any death toll on both sides was therefore worth it?

ben hubbard

Well, I asked them about that, everybody that I talked to, and they give on pretty much all counts incredibly unsatisfying answers. When you ask about the civilian Israelis who were killed in their communities, they basically deny it and say either it’s not true, this is Israeli propaganda, or they say that if any civilians were killed, they were killed in the crossfire between our fighters and Israeli security services and the military. And there’s ample evidence that show that that’s just not true. There is evidence and testimony from Israeli survivors of the attacks. There is dashcam footage from cars that were parked in places where the attacks took place. There is surveillance footage from cameras that were posted in the communities, and there’s even helmet cameras that some of the Hamas fighters were wearing that were captured by the Israelis after the fighters were killed. And so, we have that footage as well. So all of this shows that regardless of what Hamas says the objectives of the attack were, that many of these fighters just moved deliberately through these communities in a very studied way, shooting and killing people on sight. My colleagues have done work proving that they cornered civilians who had taken shelter inside a bomb shelters and threw grenades inside to try to kill them while they were stuck in there. And there’s other evidence that they just lit people’s houses on fire on top of them, so we know that Hamas’ denials are just not true. And when you ask them about, OK, well there’s a big war going on. Obviously, we see the death toll in Gaza going up every day. These are supposed to be your people. They basically say whatever Israel does is not our fault. We’re out here trying to save the Palestinian cause, and if Israel decides to come back and kill a bunch of people in Gaza, that’s not our problem. So when you take a step back and look at what they’re saying in the context of this broader goal, they just seem to be saying that all of these deaths are just the necessary cost of this blowing up of the status quo.

michael barbaro

Then bottom line. To accomplish this objective of upending the status quo, for Hamas, for its leaders, it seems like almost any amount of death would be allowable.

ben hubbard

Right. In my conversations with some of the Hamas leaders, there really did not seem to be a lot of hand-wringing about the number of civilian deaths that have come about because of this attack.

michael barbaro

So help us better understand how that status quo that Hamas is so desperate to shatter came to be and how Hamas decided that it was willing to go to this length to destroy it.

ben hubbard

So I found it very useful in trying to understand how Hamas got to this point, looking at the career of one of the people who ended up plotting this attack, and this is the head of Hamas in Gaza whose name is Yahya Sinwar.

michael barbaro

So what should we know about him?

ben hubbard

Yahya Sinwar is from the first generation of Hamas. Hamas was a Palestinian militant movement founded in the late ‘80s that was an Islamist movement that aimed to destroy Israel with military means and replace it with a Palestinian state. At this time, the Israeli military was occupying the West Bank and Gaza, and Hamas was not interested in just ending the occupation of these territories. Hamas believed that the entire state of Israel was an occupation. This sets it apart from other Palestinian movements that have negotiated with Israel and accept Israel’s right to exist. Hamas never accepted that and felt that the whole thing was wrong and that the only solution was to completely destroy Israel and replace it with a Palestinian state.

michael barbaro

Right.

ben hubbard

So Sinwar is from the very early generation of this movement, and from very early on, he’s sort of an internal security guy. He’s in charge of looking out for Israeli moles inside of the organization, and he punishes these people with such brutality that he’s given the nickname the Butcher of Khan Yunis. Khan Yunis is a town in Gaza where he was born, and so he was known as the Butcher of Khan Yunis.

michael barbaro

So he’s an enforcer within Hamas, a violent figure within an already violent group.

ben hubbard

Yes. Then in 1988, he gets arrested by the Israelis, and he is thrown in jail for the murder of four Palestinians, who were alleged collaborators with Israel spying inside of the organization. And he’s in prison for 22 years, and he describes this later as being very educational. He learns to speak good Hebrew. He reads books in Hebrew, and he describes it as being this great opportunity to really get to his enemy, to understand Israeli society, to understand how Israel works and how it thinks. And clearly, this is because he does expect or hope that someday he’s going to get out of prison and that this knowledge is going to come in useful.

michael barbaro

He’s studying Israel from inside prison so that he might someday better understand, it sounds like, their weaknesses.

ben hubbard

Right. So while he’s in jail, Hamas expands as a movement, and it becomes basically notorious for using very, very violent techniques to try to harm Israel. In 2007, it gets in a huge fight with other Palestinian factions inside of Gaza and ends up taking the place over and basically exiling the Palestinian Authority. And this puts the movement in a really new place. I mean, this was a movement that was founded to do military action against Israel, and suddenly, it finds itself governing a territory. I mean, it becomes the de facto government —

michael barbaro

Right.

ben hubbard

— of a territory that now has more than two million Palestinians. And so, instead of just wanting to launch attacks and figure out ways to military, suddenly they have to think about infrastructure and how to provide services for all these people who are technically under their rule.

michael barbaro

But of course, Sinwar is in prison and cannot be a part of this transformation of Hamas into the governing authority of Gaza.

ben hubbard

Yes. So while all this is happening on the outside, Sinwar is inside learning Hebrew and getting to know Israel better. And then all of a sudden, he gets an opportunity, and basically Hamas gets an opportunity.

In 2006, some Hamas fighters pop up from a tunnel on the Israeli side of the border separating Israel from Gaza, and they take a soldier captive, and they drag him back to Gaza, and they hold him.

And there are years of negotiations, and then in 2011, there’s an agreement for a prisoner swap. And in the end, Hamas trades this one Israeli soldier named Gilad Shalit, and they get in return more than 1,000 Palestinians released from prison.

And among them is Yahya Sinwar.

And Sinwar is one of the biggest prizes that Hamas gets out. And then he returns to Gaza, and he receives a hero’s welcome.

And he does this not just with this new Israel education that he’s gotten while he was locked up, but he also, of course, learns a lesson, which is that Israel will pay dearly to get its captives released.

michael barbaro

Right. 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, including himself, for a single Israeli soldier.

ben hubbard

Right.

And so here, you know, returns this leader with 22 years in Israeli prison, and he comes back and reintegrates into Hamas and begins his further climb up the ranks.

archived recording The Palestinian group Hamas has elected a commander of its armed wing as overall leader in Gaza.

ben hubbard

And in 2017, he actually becomes the top Hamas official in Gaza. And in that role, he starts to transform that branch of the organization. He does things to make the organization stronger, and interestingly, he sends certain messages implying that he’s actually interested in a kind of accommodation with Israel.

michael barbaro

Explain that.

ben hubbard

Well, so by this point, Hamas and Israel have settled into this strange kind of violent coexistence. They’re obviously incredibly hostile parties. Violence frequently breaks out. In fact, entire wars break out. But there’s also a lot of interaction because Israel controls almost all of Gaza’s borders, except a small part controlled by Egypt. Most of Gaza’s electricity comes from Israel. Most of Gaza’s commercial goods are brought in from Israel, and so, just for the place to survive, there needs to be a certain amount of interaction. And so, this strange process develops where violence frequently breaks out, and Hamas will fire rockets into Israel and try to hit Israeli towns and military bases. And then Israel responds with airstrikes and sometimes with assassinations of Hamas leaders inside of Gaza. And then mediators get involved, and while they’re trying to work out a ceasefire, there’s a negotiation that’s not really about the larger conflict, but sort of about some of the details of the actual blockade. And you know, Hamas is trying to find ways to loosen up this blockade to allow more goods to enter Gaza. And over time, Sinwar ends up giving people in the Israeli security establishment this impression that that’s actually something that’s important to him, that he actually does want to try to make life better for the people of Gaza and it’s not just all military all the time. And then in 2021, there’s another war between Israel and Hamas, and after that, there’s a negotiation. And again, Hamas pushes for a number of things that seem to be geared towards improving life for Gazans. They negotiate tens of millions of dollars in aid from Qatar to come in through Israel to Gaza to keep the economy functioning in the place. They negotiate work permits to try to increase the number of work permits for Gazans to leave Gaza into Israel to work because there’s really not a lot of jobs in Gaza, and so, this is a good thing for the economy. And so, at another point even more recently than that, there were clashes started by other militant factions in Gaza, and Hamas sits out. They sit on the side. And so together, this creates this impression on the Israeli side that I think there’s sort of two prongs to it. One is that the Israeli Defense technology is enough to keep Gaza contained. We have this border fence that has cameras, and it has motion sensors, and it has remote control machine guns. We have an underground wall, so there’s no tunnels. And we have Iron Dome, which is the Israeli rocket interception system. And then on top of that, they say, well, we also have this leader in Gaza who seems like he doesn’t want to get a bunch of his people killed in yet another war.

michael barbaro

It sounds like you’re saying Sinwar’s conduct and his messaging is contributing to this feeling inside Israel that maybe Gaza and Hamas can be contained. This can all be managed.

ben hubbard

Right. And it’s not that anybody thinks that they’ve managed to solve the long term conflict with Hamas. It’s more that, OK, well, we’ve got this situation under control, that with our security measures to try to keep them contained, and that if we can keep enough aid going in to keep the economy going along so that people aren’t too miserable, that in a way, this could keep things from really blowing up. But meanwhile, it’s clear to us in hindsight that Sinwar was not at all happy with that status quo and that he was covertly working to try to build up Hamas’ military capabilities inside of Gaza.

michael barbaro

Well, how so?

ben hubbard

Well, Hamas continues to build its arsenal of rockets inside of Gaza. They smuggle in the materials that they need to make them, and they build them inside of Gaza. So they’re building up this arsenal. And on a more strategic level, Sinwar comes in and he repairs the relationship between Hamas and specifically with the Hamas military wing in Gaza and some of its older regional allies. The most important of these is Iran, which had been a funder and the state supporter of Hamas since the early days of the movement. And also with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia, which is also dedicated to the destruction of Israel and works closely with Iran to try to build this sort of network of regional militias that are out to harm Israel. We know that in recent years, a number of Hamas fighters have been able to get out of Gaza and travel both to Iran and to Lebanon for various kinds of training. And looking back at this attack, we realized that they were probably learning new capabilities that really added a whole different kind of sophistication to the kinds of attacks that Hamas was able to carry out.

michael barbaro

So all these alliances you’re describing that Sinwar deepens, they’re in the service of making Hamas a stronger, more capable fighting force.

ben hubbard

Yes. I mean, he clearly knows that the battle is not over, and it certainly is clear in hindsight that his end goal was not to govern Gaza and to try to improve the life of Gazans, but he was very interested in developing the military capabilities so that he could find a way to hit Israel in a new and powerful way.

michael barbaro

So what exactly sets the stage for doing just that, hitting Israel in a new and powerful way, and for doing it when Sinwar and Hamas decide to do it, on October 7, 2023?

ben hubbard

So when I asked the Hamas leaders about this, this is where they brought up the idea that the Palestinian cause was slipping away, and they point to a number of things. And these are issues that are not just important to Hamas. These are issues that are important to all Palestinians. They talk about the most right wing government in Israeli history coming to power and basically not being at all interested in talking about any future for the Palestinians. They talk about attacks by settlers in the West Bank on Palestinian communities. They talk about police raids on the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is one of the holiest sites in Islam, which is in Jerusalem and has always been sort of a touchstone for the Palestinian claim to the city. There’s also, of course, the Israeli blockade of Gaza, which it has enforced since 2007 along with Egypt. And also sort of hanging over this is these normalization deals that are happening between Israel and other Arab countries and this idea that Israel can go around the Palestinians and find peace with the Arabs without resolving the conflict. And these are the things that they’re talking about when they’re saying, we just felt like the cause was slipping away.

michael barbaro

Right because in a sense, the cause has been slipping away, right, kind of indisputably. Arab countries who would be natural allies of the Palestinian cause are signing deals in which the only previous obstacle had been the fate of the Palestinian people. And so, in signing those deals, they’re basically saying they no longer cared about the Palestinian cause. And as you just mentioned, there are these kind of daily insults and offenses occurring that are, if you’re a Palestinian, extremely upsetting.

ben hubbard

Right. And so, Hamas basically sees all of this happening and feels like this cause is slipping away, and this is where they get this idea that we have to do something, and we have to do something big. We cannot let this issue disappear. We have to bring it back to the world’s attention, and that’s what gets us to October 7.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Ben, what have you learned through this reporting you have been doing about how under Sinwar, Hamas planned and thought about the scope of what became the October 7 attack?

ben hubbard

So we know that they basically felt that the old model was not going to be good enough, that this idea that they would fire rockets and try to hit Israeli communities and whatever, no, no, no. This had to be much, much bigger. And so, they wanted to take the fight to the Israelis. They wanted to get out of Gaza, and not just a few of them, but large numbers of them. And they wanted it to be an incredibly dramatic attack. And so, they went by air. They went by land. They went by sea. They went inside of Israeli military bases. They went inside Israeli communities and killed a lot of people and took a lot of prisoners, and they managed to bring a lot of these hostages back to Gaza. And Sinwar knows better than anybody how much the taking of one Israeli captive can change the situation.

michael barbaro

Right.

ben hubbard

And we know that when they launch this attack, they were seeking captives. They wanted to find people and bring them back to Gaza. And we also know that this attack was much, much more successful than even its plotters had anticipated. And so now, the fact that Hamas instead of just one Israeli captive has somewhere around 240, it just pushes the entire conflict into this uncharted territory where nobody really knows what comes next.

michael barbaro

Well, let’s talk more about the aftermath of this brutal attack, and how, Ben, in your reporting, you’ve been trying to understand whether Hamas did what it set out to do, given the original aims as you have described and reported them of exploding a status quo. I mean, how should we think about measuring this idea, this complicated idea, that this was, to use Hamas’ word, a success?

ben hubbard

Well, I think in the fundamental sense of setting out to shatter the status quo, then yeah. This accomplished that. Gaza’s never going to go back to what it was. I think in terms of the goal of putting the Palestinian cause back on the table, I think it was true that not many people were paying attention to it just over a month ago. And now, because of Israel’s ferocious response to the Hamas attacks and the bombing of Gaza, now we’re seeing protests coming out all over the world and different cities in the US talking about Palestinian rights in a way that we have not seen before. And there’s also this sort of frantic diplomacy that started, and you have US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken flying around and talking about the two state solution and how to make progress on it. And so, the issue is on the table in a way that it was not before this attack. And then in terms of this idea of sparking this big regional war, that has not happened, at least not to the extent that Hamas had hoped. There has been fighting on the Lebanese border with Hezbollah. There have been attacks in Iraq. But we have not seen this sort of huge uprising and the rest of the Arabs kind of joining the cause to come and try to help Hamas destroy Israel.

michael barbaro

Ben, that feels important to dwell on for just a moment. If Hamas’ militant allies in the Middle East, Hezbollah, for example, don’t become more involved in this conflict, will that be a signal that the Palestinian cause is not likely to stay top of mind for very long, and that ultimately, one of the main objectives of October 7 will have failed?

ben hubbard

I mean, one of the most surprising things I think for me about all of this is that Iran and its regional militias including Hamas had been talking for a long time about how they had built this axis of resistance and how they were much more integrated and they were sharing technology and sharing information. And there’s this idea that they had put out that if there was a war against Israel, all the pieces would fall into place, and it would be like this big sort of militant Voltron that would come together and fight Israel. And that’s not what happened. I was quite surprised in the reporting that we don’t have any indications that Hamas coordinated this attack with anybody or that they let anybody know that it was coming. Hezbollah’s response was quite cautious at the very beginning. They’re now clashing with Israel on the border, but they’ve done it in a controlled way to keep it from escalating into a bigger war. And so, it sort of raises this whole question of this idea of this big regional militia network. Well, maybe it’s not as coordinated as we thought. I mean, if Hamas is actually going to be the one to pull the plug on this big war, and these other guys don’t actually want to join it in the same way that Hamas is doing it, then maybe this network is not as tight as we expected it was.

michael barbaro

So, yes. Hamas has put the question of the Palestinians back on people’s minds, whether it’s demonstrators or like Blinken diplomats, but to what end? I mean, ideally, from the point of view of Hamas, the end is a Palestinian state and the elimination of Israel. It seems like Hamas is no closer to that now than they were before October 7. So in Hamas’ mind, what is supposed to be on the other side of the status quo that’s gone, other than Israeli death and Israeli suffering and Palestinian death and Palestinian suffering on an enormous scale?

ben hubbard

In my talks with the Hamas leaders, there was really no sense of a grand plan for what comes next. They definitely wanted to hit Israel as hard as they could, and they wanted to hit Israel inside of Israel, and they were not particularly concerned about what sort of response this would bring and what it would mean to the people of Gaza. It was that the attack somehow would be enough and would open up some new way. Now that we’re five weeks into this, I think it’s also worth pointing out that Israel doesn’t appear to have a grand plan either. The stated goal is to destroy Hamas, and Israel can probably make a lot of progress on that. They could kill a lot of the Hamas leaders. They can degrade its military capabilities. But then what? There’s not really any plan for who’s going to run Gaza once this is all over. And so, where does all this get us? I mean, I think it’s difficult to tell the future, but there’s a few possibilities. One is that the violence gets so bad and the destruction gets so great that people get sort of disgusted with it and decide that there has to be some new way forward. There has to be a new way to try to figure out how to keep this cycle from continuing. But it’s also sadly possible that Israel will go in and do whatever it feels that it needs to do in Gaza, and the world could move on, and people could go back to forgetting about the Palestinians, and we could end up in a kind of status quo like we had before, but one that’s even worse for the people of Gaza. And Israel has been trying to destroy Hamas for a long time, and this time, they may make a lot of progress. They may kill a lot of their leaders, and they may degrade their military capabilities, but there’s still going to be two million Palestinians living in Gaza, and most of them are children. And after all the trauma of living through a war like this, it’s just very hard to imagine that they’re going to grow up and feel like they want to live peacefully next door with Israel, and it’s certainly not hard to imagine that some other organization could come up, and that it’s not going to have a hard time finding recruits.

michael barbaro

Right. What you’re describing is a potential new status quo replacing this shattered status quo that is worse for the people in Gaza, and in theory, potentially worse for Israel.

ben hubbard

Yes. I think that’s the worst case scenario for how this could all end.

michael barbaro

Well, thank you, Ben. We appreciate it.

ben hubbard

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. With the US government set to run out of money at midnight Friday, the new Republican House Speaker, conservative Mike Johnson, has proposed a temporary funding plan that so far is drawing support from Democrats and opposition from Johnson’s fellow far right Republicans. That raises the possibility that Johnson’s first major piece of legislation, a continuing resolution known as a CR, will only win passage with the support of House Democrats, a reality that doomed Johnson’s predecessor, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.

344,344,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/opinion/israel-gaza-war-history.html,"For the past month, normal life in Ramallah — a city in the West Bank usually known for its young population and its vibrant nightlife — has been brought to a standstill.

Since Hamas’s deadly Oct. 7 attacks, Israeli forces have launched numerous raids on the West Bank, arresting people from all walks of life: students, activists, journalists, even individuals posting online in support of Gaza. Air and drone strikes have destroyed houses and streets, targeted numerous refugee camps, and nearly leveled Al-Ansar Mosque. They have pummeled the city of Jenin; last month, Israeli forces destroyed the memorial for an Al Jazeera journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh, at the spot where she was killed while reporting more than a year ago.

Meanwhile, a settlement council has been distributing hundreds of assault rifles to civilian squads in settlements in the northern West Bank, part of a larger effort by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who is a settler himself, to arm civilian groups in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks. So far, the ministry has purchased 10,000 assault rifles for such teams around the country. It’s part of the atmosphere of escalating violence that has killed more than 130 Palestinians living in the West Bank since Oct. 7.

For Palestinians, this type of systematic violence is nothing new.

To many inside and outside this war, the brutality of Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks was unthinkable, as have been the scale and ferocity of Israel’s reprisal. But Palestinians have been subject to a steady stream of unfathomable violence — as well as the creeping annexation of their land by Israel and Israeli settlers — for generations.

If people are going to understand this latest conflict and see a path forward for everyone, we need to be more honest, nuanced and comprehensive about the recent decades of history in Gaza, Israel and the West Bank, particularly the impact of occupation and violence on the Palestinians. This story is measured in decades, not weeks; it is not one war, but a continuum of destruction, revenge and trauma.

Since the 1948 nakba — in which entire Palestinian villages were wiped off the map and the modern state of Israel was established — Palestinians have endured a subjugation that has defined their daily lives. For decades, we have been reeling from Israel’s military occupation, as well as a succession of deadly invasions and wars. The wars of 1967 and 1973 helped shape the modern geography and geopolitics of the area, with millions of largely stateless Palestinians split between Gaza and the West Bank. In Gaza, often referred to as the world’s largest open-air prison, Palestinians are prohibited from entering or leaving, except in incredibly rare circumstances.

This history has been absent from much of the discourse surrounding the Israel-Hamas war, as though the attacks of Oct. 7 were completely arbitrary. The truth is, even in times of relative peace, Palestinians are second-class citizens in Israel — if they are deemed citizens at all. According to Israeli law, Palestinians do not have the right to national self-determination, which is reserved for Jewish citizens of the state. A variety of laws restrict Palestinians’ right to movement, governing everything from where they can live to what personal identifications they can hold to whether or not they can visit family members elsewhere.

The “right of return” — the right of Palestinians and their descendants to return to villages they were ethnically cleansed from during the 1948 war — is central to many Palestinians’ political perspective because so many are still, legally, refugees. In Gaza, for instance, roughly two-thirds of the population consists of refugees. This status is not some abstraction; it dictates everything from where people live to which schools they go to or doctors they see.

Many Gazans have parents and grandparents who grew up only a few miles from where they live now, in areas they are now, of course, forbidden to enter. They still invoke rich memories from their childhood or adolescence, when they walked through citrus groves in Yaffa or olive fields in Qumya — the latter of which, like many villages whose people were expelled into Gaza during the 1948 war, was later transformed into a kibbutz.

There have been periods of increased cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians over the past 75 years. But these were usually preceded by times of increased conflict, such as the first and second intifadas, or popular uprisings. The intifadas, in which Palestinians participated in large-scale resistance, sometimes civil and sometimes violent, are often presented by Western media as random or indiscriminate bursts of murderous savagery — as has been the case with the Oct. 7 attacks. But that violence did not happen in a vacuum.

Stark conditions in Palestinian communities — including the ever-tightening control of daily life through violent night raids, arrests, military checkpoints and the building of illegal Israeli settlements — were the backdrop to these outbursts. Unfortunately, from a historical standpoint, these acts of violence seem to be the only things that have moved the needle politically for Palestinians.

The death and destruction we Palestinians have collectively witnessed and endured have prolonged our generational trauma. Even before this conflict, PTSD was pervasive in Palestinian homes, as was depression. As a young population, children bear the brunt of Israel’s military rule: Many are snatched at night from their beds or from the arms of their mothers, beaten and imprisoned after being tried arbitrarily in military courts. Others are shot and paralyzed, if not killed.

In Gaza, these victims have virtually no legal possibility of recourse from the Israeli state. Under the 16-year siege of Gaza, Israeli administrators have controlled access to electricity, food and water, at one point determining the number of calories Gazans could consume before sliding into malnutrition. They have also allowed Gaza and the occupied territories to serve as a testing ground for Israel’s vaunted security tech firms. Many people from Gaza have risked the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to get out, only to die en route.

With Gaza sealed for the past 16 years and the West Bank largely contained by settler violence and the army, Israel has been able to keep its occupation indefinite. The periodic spasms of violence — such as the occasional small group or lone wolf attacks and rocket barrages — reinforce the state’s justification for long-term control of Palestinians and Palestinian lands.

Over the years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his advisers have been very clear that a separate, sovereign Palestinian state is not on the negotiating table. Neither is the possibility of giving Palestinians the rights that Israelis enjoy. So the status quo of endless occupation — and regular cycles of violence — has become normalized, with the international community seemingly unwilling or unable to hold Israel’s government to account.

The Oct. 7 attacks broke that state of play. The occupation’s unsustainable nature was laid bare for all to see, as was the impossibility of governing two peoples but privileging one of them over the other.

Dark days are ahead — that much we know. Having lived through wars, invasions and bombardments, we have come to expect the worst. In the West Bank, morale is low on the quiet streets. Twenty-four-hour Arabic satellite news stations provide a droning, ubiquitous background to daily life. They play a constant stream of horrific images and videos: all shocking but not unprecedented.

A feeling of helplessness permeates the West Bank’s cities and villages as we watch more and more fellow Palestinians — now more than 11,100, according to the Gazan health ministry — lose their lives. Israeli officials have proposed pushing Gaza’s population into Egypt’s Sinai Desert, which would render them refugees twice or three times over, and perhaps edge the Israeli settler project into a new, more expansive phase. In the West Bank, we look around, and wonder: Could it happen here? Is it happening already?

Any kind of shared future is most likely a longer way off than it was a month ago. But Palestinians already knew that. Was the day before Hamas’s attacks considered peace? Maybe for Israelis it was, but for Palestinians it wasn’t.

345,345,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostage-video-noa-marciano.html,"Hamas on Monday released a video of a 19-year-old Israeli soldier who was captured in the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel that included clips of her speaking early in the conflict and then images of her lifeless body. Hamas said she had been killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on Thursday.

The Israeli military confirmed the death of the soldier, Noa Marciano, in a brief statement on Tuesday that did not indicate how she had died but said she had been “kidnapped by a terrorist organization.” An earlier statement that appeared to confirm the authenticity of the video condemned it as “psychological terrorism.”

Ms. Marciano served in an intelligence unit and was stationed at a lookout post on Kibbutz Nahal Oz when Hamas attacked.

“Our hearts are with the Marciano family,” Israeli military officials said in a statement, noting that a military representative had visited the family and informed them of the video’s release. Military officials pledged to support the Marcianos and other hostages’ families, promising that they are “using all means, both intelligence and operational, to bring the hostages home.”

The video shows Ms. Marciano speaking into a camera and providing identifying information about herself and her family. She says that she is being held in Gaza and has been there for about four days with other hostages, and she pleads with the Israeli military to stop targeting the area, saying the explosions are close by, continual and could harm the hostages. The video ends with still images of Ms. Marciano’s lifeless body splayed on a bloodied white sheet. It was impossible to independently conclude how Ms. Marciano died."
346,346,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/world/middleeast/iran-israel-hamas.html,"For more than four decades, Iran’s rulers have pledged to destroy Israel. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rarely appears in public without wearing a black-and-white checkered Palestinian kaffiyeh.

Iranian military commanders gloat over training and arming groups across the region that are enemies of Israel, including Hezbollah and Hamas. And when Hamas conducted the Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel that killed 1,400 people, Iranian officials praised it as a momentous achievement, shattering the Jewish state’s sense of security.

Now Iran faces a dilemma, weighing how it and its proxy militias — known as the axis of resistance — should respond to Israel’s invasion of Gaza and whether to bolster its revolutionary credentials at the risk of igniting a broader regional war. More than 8,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

“There is no need for Iran to directly get involved in the war and attack Israel itself because it has the resistance axis militia who follow Iran’s policies and strategies and act on its behalf,” said Nasser Imani, an analyst close to the government, in a telephone interview from Tehran. “Right now Iran is in control mode — it is telling all of them, including Hezbollah, to keep things boiling but have restraint.”

For the time being, Iranian officials are publicly signaling they do not want a full-scale war.

“I want to reiterate that we are not pursuing the spreading of this war,” Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, said in a recent interview at Iran’s mission to the United Nations. He was in New York to attend U.N. meetings related to the war. But, he added, “The region is at a boiling point and any moment it may explode and this may be unavoidable. If this happens, all sides will lose control.”"
347,347,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/us/politics/republicans-israel-war-protests-college-campuses.html,"This week, the Biden administration said it would amplify efforts to fight antisemitism on college campuses, directing the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security to connect campus security with state and local law enforcement and expedite the processing of discrimination complaints under a statute that is intended to specifically prohibit certain forms of antisemitism and Islamophobia.

“The political leadership has been rock solid on this,” Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said of the Biden administration after attending closed-door White House meetings on Monday to deliver recommendations for improving safety at schools. “They are focused on this like a laser, and they should be.”

Still, Republicans see opportunities to exploit divisions within the liberal coalition, highlighting the views of an energized left that casts the Palestinian cause as an extension of other racial and social justice movements.

They have focused on a few largely Black and Latino progressive Democrats — a “Hamas caucus,” Republicans provocatively call them — who have vocally opposed the Israeli government and voted against a House resolution last week condemning “Hamas’ brutal war against Israel” and standing with the Jewish state.

Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley, said Republicans were mischaracterizing a complex, emotionally fraught issue to score political points. He has urged school administrators to exercise their free-speech rights to denounce antisemitism, but he also argues that students should be allowed free speech, even if it is offensive or hateful.

“I think trying to exploit it as part of the culture wars is inappropriate, misleading, unhelpful,” said Mr. Chemerinsky, who has himself been the subject of antisemitic conspiracy theories in recent weeks. “For many, the existence of Israel, or opposition to it, is deeply personal. None of this tracks the traditional liberal, conservative lines.”

The specter of swastikas dotting college campuses known for their liberal values has been catnip for Fox News and other conservative news outlets. These outlets have delivered a drumbeat of coverage, casting antisemitic incidents — and the cautious responses many university leaders initially put out — as symbolic of views that have overtaken not just the Democratic Party but also the nation’s higher educational system.

Matt Brooks, the president of the Republican Jewish Coalition, said the issue exposed liberal hypocrisy, arguing that university administrators valued Jewish students less than other minority groups that have been targeted in recent years.

“If the roles were reversed, and it were African American students, if it were L.G.B.T.Q. students, the university no doubt would crack down and make sure that this was a safe space for them on the college campuses,” Mr. Brooks said. “They’re not doing that for the Jewish students. And it’s absolutely outrageous.”

In his speech to the R.J.C., Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina denounced what he called “poisonous antisemitism that has been allowed to fester on the radical left in American politics,” adding that universities “had no problem” speaking up about political controversies in the past. “But now? Now that their own institutions are being used as platforms to call for genocide? Now they offer pathetic equivocation or, worse, deafening silence.”

“They seem more offended by ‘microaggressions’ than by mass murder,” Mr. Scott said. “If this were any other minority group, hear me, the far left would be screaming from the rooftops.”"
348,348,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/world/middleeast/gaza-war-hospitals-israel.html,"With Israel’s ground war in the Gaza Strip in its third week, Israeli military vehicles on Monday arrived at the gates of a besieged hospital complex where fuel, medicine and food are running out. Inside the hospital, the nursing staff were moving 36 premature babies to the only department that still had oxygen.

“Their lives are in danger,” said Dr. Nasser Bolbol, the head of the neonatal intensive care unit at the hospital, Al-Shifa. Before the babies were moved, three others had died when the oxygen was cut in the neonatal ward, Dr. Bolbol said.

As near-constant shelling shook the hospital buildings to their foundations, members of the medical staff painted a picture of the increasingly calamitous conditions inside Al-Shifa for the hundreds of patients and the estimated 8,000 people who have taken shelter there.

On Monday, more than 100 bodies were decomposing in the hospital’s front yard, another 50 were inside and about 60 others were in the morgue, said a spokesman for the Gazan Health Ministry, ​​Medhat Abbas. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Monday that a power cut at the hospital had led to at least 12 deaths.

But escaping Gaza’s desperate hospitals carries its own perils.

Fighting on Monday near Al-Quds Hospital, a mile to the south of Al-Shifa, disrupted an effort to evacuate patients and the medical staff from the facility, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, which reported “shelling and violent explosions” along with “heavy gunfire.” A convoy of vehicles that had been traveling from southern Gaza could not reach Al-Quds because of the bombardment, the agency said."
349,349,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/us/politics/state-dept-israel-gaza-cease-fire.html,"Dozens of State Department employees have signed internal memos to Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken expressing serious disagreement with the Biden administration’s approach to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, according to U.S. officials, part of a surging tide of internal disagreement within the Biden administration over the Middle East crisis.

At least three internal cables, sent via a dissent channel established during the Vietnam War, have urged President Biden to call for a cease-fire in Gaza, according to an official, who spoke anonymously to discuss sensitive diplomatic cables that have not been released to the public.

Two were sent in the first week of the war, and the third was sent more recently, the official said. Another official, also speaking anonymously, confirmed the three cables.

Israel forces have been on the attack in Gaza for more than a month following the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel. The death toll in Gaza is over 11,000, according to the health ministry there.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has insisted that there can be no cease-fire, saying that one would only benefit Hamas, and the Biden administration has supported that position. Instead, Mr. Biden has been pressing Israel, with mixed success, to adopt “humanitarian pauses.”

The most recent of the memos, first reported by Axios, proposed that Israel trade Palestinian prisoners it was holding, some of whom have not been charged, for the more than 200 hostages abducted by Hamas from Israel on Oct. 7.

At least one of the memos also asks the administration to offer a serious plan for a long-term peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians that would create a Palestinian state — and not simply pay lip service to the idea, as critics say Mr. Biden and Mr. Blinken have done.

Mr. Blinken has met in person with signatories to at least one of the cables sent in the first week, one of the officials said. One of Mr. Blinken’s senior aides met with the signers of another cable sent that week, the official said.

Mr. Blinken has conducted at least one other listening session with employees of the Near East Affairs bureau, some of whom believe U.S. policy has been too tolerant of the civilian casualties inflicted by Israel’s military in densely-populated Gaza.

Mr. Blinken responded to the internal dissent in a message emailed to department employees on Monday and obtained by The New York Times. “I know that for many of you, the suffering caused by this crisis is taking a profound personal toll,” he wrote, adding that he was aware that “some people in the department may disagree with approaches we are taking or have views on what we can do better.”

In the message, Mr. Blinken said the State Department had “organized forums in Washington to hear from you, and urged managers and teams to have candid discussions at posts around the world precisely so we can hear your feedback and ideas.”

He added: “We’re listening: What you share is informing our policy and our messages.”

U.S. officials say that while differing opinions and fresh perspectives are welcome, employees at the State Department and elsewhere in the government must accept and implement policy set at senior levels.

The cables come as dissent throughout the Biden administration is increasingly spilling into public view. Earlier this month, more than a thousand employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development signed a letter, previously reported by The Washington Post and Foreign Policy, insisting on a cease-fire.

The State Department’s dissent channel was created in 1971 to allow department officials to express criticisms and disagreements over the Vietnam War. Under State Department rules, dissenters are protected from retaliation.

In recent years, State Department employees have used the channel to warn against President Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, urge the Obama administration to launch airstrikes against Syrian forces and to denounce President Trump’s temporary ban on allowing citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries to enter the United States."
350,350,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/world/middleeast/un-unrwa-gaza-aid-israel.html,"The United Nations said on Monday that its already dwindling reserve of fuel in the Gaza Strip would run out as soon as Tuesday, preventing the organization from receiving and distributing the desperately needed aid trickling in, and imperiling the only lifeline for the 2.2 million people in the coastal enclave.

The U.N.’s agency for aiding Palestinians, UNRWA, has been the main coordinator of humanitarian aid crossing into Gaza from Egypt since Israel placed Gaza under siege. Trucks carrying essential goods such as water, food, medicine and hygienic products go to U.N. warehouses in Gaza, where they are unloaded and distributed in other trucks by the U.N. and humanitarian agency partners, the U.N. said.

Andrea De Domenico, the head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for Palestinian territories, told reporters on Monday that as of Tuesday the U.N. will no longer have enough fuel to operate either the fork lifts that unload the goods or the trucks that distribute them.

As part of its offensive against Hamas, Israel has cut off electricity to Gaza and blocked the delivery of fuel, saying Hamas uses it for rocket attacks and has stockpiled fuel intended for civilians. More than one million Gazans have been displaced, and civilians are running perilously low on basic human necessities.

“Instead of a much-needed increase of this assistance, we have been informed by colleagues of UNRWA that, due to the lack of fuel, as of tomorrow the operations of receiving trucks will no longer be possible,” Mr. De Domenico said from Jerusalem.

A total of 980 trucks carrying essential aid have crossed into Gaza from Egypt, including 76 trucks on Sunday, Mr. De Domenico said. But the U.N. has said far more is needed. Before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, about 500 trucks of humanitarian aid crossed into Gaza daily.

The U.N. is worried that the fuel shortage could impede its humanitarian operations and the ability of hospitals, which rely on generators in the absence of power, to treat patients. Gaza’s main hospital, Al-Shifa, has reported that the lack of fuel was putting patients in intensive care at risk of dying and that premature babies were taken out of incubators that were now useless. Three babies and two cardiology patients had died as of Monday, according to Al-Shifa officials.

Al-Shifa’s critical infrastructure — including its water tanks, oxygen stations, maternity ward and cardiovascular facilities — was damaged by the fighting, Mr. De Domenico said. Three nurses were killed, he said."
351,351,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/04/opinion/sunday/israel-palestine-speech-debate.html,"Last week, the Anti-Defamation League and the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law sent a letter to nearly 200 college presidents urging them to investigate campus chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine for potential violations of federal and state laws against providing material support to terrorism. As evidence for these very serious accusations, the ADL and the Brandeis center offered only the student group’s own strident rhetoric, including a sentence in its online tool kit, which praised Hamas’s attacks on Israel and said: “We must act as part of this movement. All of our efforts continue the work and resistance of the Palestinians on the ground.”

Under the direction of Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida has also ordered state universities to shut chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine. Citing the same tool kit, DeSantis said, “That is material support to terrorism, and that is not going to be tolerated in the state of Florida, and it should not be tolerated in these United States of America.” Virginia’s Republican attorney general has opened an investigation into American Muslims for Palestine, a national group that, according to the ADL, helps coordinate the activities of Students for Justice in Palestine, “for potentially violating Virginia’s charitable solicitation laws, including benefiting or providing support to terrorist organizations.” Several Republicans, including Donald Trump, have called for revoking the visas of pro-Palestinian student activists.

Ever since Hamas’s slaughter and mass kidnapping of Israelis on Oct. 7, there has been mounting fear and fury over the mistreatment of Jews at American colleges and universities. The Homeland Security, Justice and Education Departments are all taking steps to combat campus antisemitism. Congressional resolutions have condemned it. But while plenty of pro-Palestinian students have behaved in appalling ways, many also feel besieged, and for good reason.

For Palestinian and Muslim students, the invocation of terrorism law is especially frightening. Attempts to curtail anti-Zionist activism are not new; about 35 states have laws targeting the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel. But now advocates for Palestinian rights describe a new level of repression. “The ADL is calling for the mass violation of students’ rights in a manner that’s reminiscent of the post 9/11 environment, but with a more intensely Palestinian twist,” said Radhika Sainath, a senior staff attorney at the civil rights organization Palestine Legal. She predicts that if federal and state governments follow through on the ADL’s demands, Palestinian activists will be subjected to an increase in surveillance, infiltration and investigation, even though their groups “pose zero threat and have done nothing but engage in speech 100 percent protected by the First Amendment.”

Columbia University’s Rashid Khalidi, a pre-eminent historian of Palestinian history, readily acknowledged a rash of recent antisemitic incidents on college campuses. But he drew a distinction between interpersonal harassment and an institutional crackdown. “Both sides have feelings of being victimized,” he told me, but the forces arrayed against them are not the same. “The Patriot Act may be mobilized to shut down speech” deemed supportive of Palestinian terrorism. “That’s the difference.”

No one should underestimate how awful the campus climate is for many Jewish students, who’ve experienced a surge in violence and abuse. At Cornell, an engineering student was arrested after threatening to shoot up a kosher dining hall and calling for Jews to be raped and murdered. Demonstrators at a rally in support of Palestinians assaulted Jewish counterprotesters at Tulane; one student had his nose broken. In October, Erwin Chemerinsky, the law school dean of at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote an opinion essay headlined, “Nothing Has Prepared Me for the Antisemitism I See on College Campuses Now.” In it, he told of a student who insisted that she would feel safe on campus only if the school got “rid of the Zionists.”

This hostile environment stems, at least in part, from the nearly vaunted role played by the Palestinian cause in the left’s understanding of global dispossession. Because America helps underwrite Israel’s military occupation, Palestinians are often viewed as singular symbols of imperialist oppression. For decades, radical Black activists in America have seen, in Israel’s occupation of Palestine, a mirror of their own subjugation, and that identification was supercharged during America’s 2020 racial justice protests, when a mural of George Floyd appeared in Gaza City. In some social justice circles, then, support for Israel is viewed as something akin to support for the K.K.K.

This contempt for Zionism has only accelerated with the pulverizing bombing of Gaza and its thousands of civilian casualties. And too often, on hothouse campuses full of young people with half-formed ideas and poor impulse control, anti-Zionism segues into hatred directed at Jews.

For some Jews on campus, the vituperation against Zionism has been particularly disorienting because, for years now, they’ve been trained in exquisite sensitivity to identity-based slights.

Not all Jews identify with the state of Israel, of course, and activists from Jewish groups like Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow have led protests against Israel’s war on Gaza. But many Jews see their relationship with Israel as an essential part of their Jewishness, and even some fierce critics of Israel’s government were shaken by the widespread demonization of the country so soon after Hamas’s atrocities. When they say that the campus climate makes them feel unsafe — a rhetorical trump card in other contexts — they expect official action.

On Wednesday, the presidents of several Israeli universities wrote a letter to their international colleagues calling on them to accord Jewish and Israeli students and faculty members “the same respect and protections as any other minority.” Citing principles of safety and inclusivity, the letter said, “Just as it would be unthinkable for an academic institution to extend free speech protections to groups targeting other protected classes, so too should demonstrations that call for our destruction and glorify violence against Jews be explicitly prohibited and condemned.”

But this demand for protection can collide with the First Amendment rights of Zionism’s critics, and with academic freedom more broadly. “I wouldn’t compare this with the internment of the Japanese Americans in World War II, but the point I’m making is that there are times when people get really upset about what’s happening in the world and do things that are unwise at best and really harmful to people and democracy at worst,” said Kenneth Stern, director of Bard College’s Center for the Study of Hate and author of “The Conflict Over the Conflict: The Israel/Palestine Campus Debate.”

Stern occupies a unique position in this profoundly polarizing debate. He’s a liberal Zionist and an expert on antisemitism, as well as a committed civil libertarian who critiques the way mainstream Jewish groups wield institutional power to try to silence pro-Palestinian voices.

As he describes in his book, in 1982, he resigned from the left-wing National Lawyers Guild rather than face what felt like a purge for refusing to sign onto a strictly pro-Palestinian line. Years later, he became the in-house antisemitism expert at the American Jewish Committee, but eventually left in part over concern that, in its ardent defense of Israel on college campuses, the group was forsaking a commitment to academic freedom. He helped draft an internationally adopted definition of antisemitism that includes some forms of anti-Zionism. He’s also inveighed, in opinion essays, congressional testimony and in his 2020 book, against the use of that definition, put out by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance in 2016, to traduce the free speech of Israel’s critics.

“The complexity of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict should make it an ideal subject to teach critical thinking and how to have difficult discussions,” writes Stern. “Instead, it is being used as a toxin that threatens the entire academic enterprise.”

As with the conflict between Israel and Palestine more broadly, there’s plenty of blame to go around. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a libertarian-leaning free speech organization, shared data with me showing that, since 2002, there have been more attempts made to de-platform pro-Palestinian campus speakers than pro-Israel ones. But attempts to shut down pro-Israel speakers, by disinviting or disrupting them, are more likely to be successful.

Both sides, then, have credible stories to tell about being censored and intimidated. The difference is where that intimidation is coming from. For supporters of Israel, it largely comes from peers and, in some cases, professors. For supporters of Palestine, it comes from powerful outside institutions, including the state.

There is little reason to think that the pressure brought to bear by these outside institutions is making Jewish students any safer. One result of the denunciatory mood that overtook many progressive spaces toward the tail end of the Trump years was to give reactionary ideas a rebellious frisson. You could see this in the little subculture of New York scenesters who adopted the trappings of conservative Catholicism as a rebuke to liberalism, but also in more significant cultural phenomena, like the popularity of the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast and the right-wing radicalization of Elon Musk. Among young people, the appeal of right-wing heterodoxy was limited by the fact that relatively few want to give up either a commitment to human equality or premarital sex. Anti-Zionist activism, by contrast, offers something that’s been missing from left-wing politics for years: the chance to stand up for the downtrodden and scandalize elites.

“By trying to censor anti-Israel remarks, it becomes more, not less, difficult to tackle both antisemitism and anti-Israel dogma,” Stern writes in his book. “The campus debate is changed from one of exposing bigotry to one of protecting free speech, and the last thing pro-Israel advocates need is a reputation for censoring, rather than refuting, their opponents.”

Of course, Israel’s partisans already have that reputation. “What can you say about what settlers are doing in the West Bank?” asked Khalidi. “What can you say about ethnic cleansing in 1948,” the year of Israel’s founding? “How can you defend any of those things? They don’t have an argument. They have to shut down debate.” Those who disagree with him might try to prove him wrong."
352,352,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/us/politics/rashida-tlaib-palestine-israel.html,"At a gathering in solidarity with Israeli hostages last week at Adat Shalom synagogue, Jeremy Moss, a Democratic state senator from Southfield, a suburb with a large Jewish population in Ms. Tlaib’s district, spoke with concerned constituents. “I had so many people coming up to me saying that they don’t feel seen, heard, represented,” he said.

The following night, in the majority Arab American enclave of Dearborn, at a memorial for Palestinian casualties of the Israeli invasion of Gaza, speakers denounced the censure of Ms. Tlaib in Congress for her statements on the conflict.

Khalid Turaani, a Palestinian American activist, compared Ms. Tlaib’s censure to that of Joshua Reed Giddings, a congressman and abolitionist who was censured by his House colleagues in 1842 for introducing resolutions opposing the slave trade.

“I guess history is repeating itself,” Mr. Turaani, who leads the Michigan Task Force for Palestine, told the crowd.

Since Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, no American politician save for President Biden has featured more centrally in arguments over the Israel-Hamas war than Ms. Tlaib. Since her election in 2018, the congresswoman, who has family living in the West Bank, has been the leading voice for Palestinian rights in Congress.

This year, thanks to a redistricting shake-up, she began representing one of the largest Arab American communities in the country, as well as parts of the largest Jewish community in the Detroit area. The war has put her in the increasingly difficult position of representing both constituencies, whose views of the conflict are both deeply personal and often extraordinarily difficult to reconcile.

Interviews in Ms. Tlaib’s district revealed a split-screen view of the war in Gaza and laid bare the grievances that have shaped it. It is a particularly acute version of the national debate over the conflict, rooted in family histories of the Holocaust and personal experiences of lost lives and land since the advent of Israeli statehood.

The divide would pose a formidable challenge for any politician. But for Ms. Tlaib, who has staked out a position that alienates many of those constituents, it could be unbridgeable.

After the Oct. 7 attack, in which Hamas attackers killed about 1,200 people and took about 240 hostages, Ms. Tlaib was one of 10 House members who voted against a resolution to condemn Hamas and reaffirm $3.3 billion a year in U.S. military assistance to Israel.

On Nov. 3, she posted a video on social media accusing President Biden of supporting the “genocide of the Palestinian people” and including footage of demonstrators chanting “from the river to the sea,” a pro-Palestinian slogan that many see as calling for not only the restoration of Palestinian land claims but also the eradication of Israel.

Ms. Tlaib has said she saw it as “an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction or hate.” In a statement released shortly before the censure vote, she vowed to “continue to work for a just and lasting peace that upholds the human rights and dignity of all people, centers peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians, and ensures that no person, no child has to suffer or live in fear of violence.”

Ms. Tlaib’s defense of the slogan drew condemnation from the Biden administration, as well as criticism from Michigan’s attorney general, Dana Nessel, and disavowal from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, both Democrats.

On Tuesday, 22 of Ms. Tlaib’s Democratic colleagues joined House Republicans in passing a resolution to censure her and accusing her of “calling for the destruction of the state of Israel.” Democratic Majority for Israel, a group led by the Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, is running television ads in the Detroit area criticizing Ms. Tlaib.

“I think Congresswoman Tlaib is radically out of step with her colleagues in Congress, radically out of step with the Democratic Party, and radically out of step with Democrats in Michigan,” Mr. Mellman said. “We hope she will change her views, and if not, perhaps somebody might be interested in running against her.”"
353,353,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-blinken-gaza.html,"Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, who traveled to Israel on Friday as the ground war against Hamas in Gaza escalated, urged protections for Palestinian noncombatants and “humanitarian pauses” in the fighting, even as he spoke of “solidarity” with Israel’s right to defend itself.

Soon after meeting with Mr. Blinken, however, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel appeared to rebuff the Biden administration’s call for pauses in the military campaign to allow more deliveries into Gaza of badly needed food, water, medicine and other supplies.

Mr. Netanyahu said that any cease-fire would be contingent on the release of Israeli hostages, many of them women and children, abducted in the attack by Hamas on Oct. 7 that killed at least 1,400.

“I have made clear that we are continuing forcefully, and that Israel refuses a temporary cease-fire that does not include the release of our hostages,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “Israel does not allow the entry of fuel to the Gaza Strip and opposes the transfer of funds to Gaza.”"
354,354,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/world/middleeast/chevron-israel-tamar-gas.html,"Chevron said Monday that it had resumed production of natural gas from a platform in Israeli waters on instructions from the government. Israel’s Ministry of Energy had ordered the U.S. energy giant to halt production at the Tamar platform, shortly after the Oct. 7 raids by militants from Hamas in Israel and the start of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza.

“We have resumed supplying customers in Israel and in the region from the Tamar Production Platform,” Chevron said in a statement. The facility, in the Mediterranean Sea, is about 12 miles offshore from the Gaza Strip.

Restarting Tamar likely means that the Israeli government has decided that the fighting with Hamas no longer threatens the facility. The initial anxiety about a wider escalation of the fighting disrupting energy supplies in the region has faded, and prices have recently slumped.

Gas is vital to Israel’s economy, typically accounting for about 70 percent of electric power generation. Israel sells its excess gas to Egypt and Jordan. Bringing Tamar back into operation gives Israel more gas to export to Egypt. Sales of gas are an important component of the ties between the two countries, which together control access to Gaza.

Cairo uses the fuel imported from Israel to generate electric power, run factories and export onward to Europe and other destinations through two liquefied natural gas terminals on the country’s Mediterranean coast.

The closure of Tamar has contributed to a tight gas market in Egypt, crimping domestic consumption and exports.

Chevron is now the key player in Israel’s energy industry, operating not only the Tamar platform but a second large source of gas called the Leviathan field. The production facility for Leviathan is in waters off Haifa in northern Israel and is less vulnerable to rocket fire from Gaza. On the other hand, Leviathan is closer to Lebanon, the base of fighters from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia that has clashed with Israel since the outbreak of fighting in Gaza.

Chevron hopes to use its position in Israel, Egypt and Cyprus as a regional springboard to become a major exporter to Europe. It is not clear what impact the war may have on these ambitions.

A third platform in Israeli waters, run by a company called Energean, also produces gas in the area."

It often seems to me that we need a term to describe a somewhat similar phenomenon in policy debates, which we might call the Big Grift: policy proposals so corrupt, so obviously designed to benefit an undeserving few at everyone else’s expense that many voters balk at the notion that seemingly respectable politicians actually advocate such things.

A case in point is the current demand by House Republicans that funding for Israel in this moment of crisis be tied to budget cuts that would undermine the ability of the Internal Revenue Service to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. This should be a major scandal, but my suspicion is that many voters just won’t accept the idea that G.O.P. leaders would do something so cartoonishly villainous.

Some history: Way back in 2001, in the aftermath of Sept. 11, House Republicans passed a bill responding to the emergency by … cutting corporate taxes. At the time, my sources told me that when political consultants tried to describe the bill to focus groups of voters, they refused to believe that the legislation was being described accurately."

357,357,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/world/middleeast/gaza-al-shifa-hospital-world-health-organization.html,"Gaza’s Al-Shifa Hospital is no longer functioning, according to the World Health Organization, which warned of a “dire and perilous” situation for hundreds of patients and displaced people trapped inside as Israeli troops battle Hamas fighters nearby.

The W.H.O. said on Sunday that three days “without electricity, without water and with very poor internet” had severely hurt Al-Shifa’s ability to provide care. It cited constant gunfire and bombings in the area, and said patient deaths had increased significantly.

“Regrettably, the hospital is not functioning as a hospital anymore,” the agency’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a statement.

The health ministry in Gaza said that at least six wounded patients had died at the hospital, Gaza’s main hospital, on Saturday as a result of a power outage, including two premature babies. Without fuel to run generators, the hospital has been plunged into darkness, the ministry and the hospital’s administrator said.

Israeli security officials say that Hamas has built a vast command complex under the hospital, making it a legitimate military target. Hamas has denied the allegations, as has Al-Shifa’s director, Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, who has called them “untrue.”

In recent days, Israeli soldiers have surrounded at least one other hospital in northern Gaza, stepping up their push to empty the facilities, according to Israeli military officials, as fighting around them intensifies.

At Al-Rantisi Specialized Hospital for Children, the only medical center with a pediatric cancer ward in the strip, Dr. Bakr Gaoud, the head of the hospital, said Israeli forces moved in late last week, damaging the ground floor and destroying several vehicles before providing maps that showed a safe evacuation route, which patients and staff soon used.

A second hospital, Al-Nasr, was similarly emptied out by Israel on Friday, and the health ministry reported strikes against other hospitals over the weekend.

At Al-Quds Hospital, “heavy gunfire” was continuing nearby, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said on Monday, and that “shelling and violent explosions were heard in the area.” A convoy of vehicles that had been traveling from the south to Al-Quds in an effort to evacuate patients and medical staff could not reach the hospital because of the bombardment, the agency said."
358,358,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/opinion/america-biden-israel-gaza.html,"In the days after Oct. 7, Mr. Biden had the opportunity to shape Israel’s response by publicly defining what kind of actions the United States would, and would not, support. While expressing solidarity with Israel and revulsion at Hamas, he might have withheld assistance for a military campaign until Israel formulated a plan that the White House deemed effective and just and that treated Palestinian civilians acceptably. Instead, Mr. Biden announced, “We’re with Israel,” pledging to provide for its defense “today, tomorrow and always.” Even as he privately pressed Israeli leaders to think twice about a ground invasion, he publicly requested $14.3 billion in emergency military aid, no strings attached.

There was no need to be so cavalier. A carrot-and-stick approach could have either improved Israel’s actions or distanced the United States from a costly failure. Yet the administration seemed to barely try; it preferred to commit itself first and then find out for what. Now the United States finds itself following Israel’s lead in a brutal war “of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences,” as Barack Obama, then a senator, described the invasion of Iraq before it began. U.S. officials are increasingly signaling their displeasure at Israeli military operations in Gaza and mounting settler violence in the West Bank, but they will have little leverage to make Israel change course unless they specify an “or else.”

Mr. Biden has been no better in identifying a long-term solution. Sidestepping the obvious reality that the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land lies at the core of the conflict, Mr. Biden has mainly described Palestinians either as evil terrorists or as innocent civilians deserving of humanitarian protection. But Palestinians most importantly are political agents who seek self-determination and refuse to be ignored. Mr. Biden’s deflective, ideological language — “Terrorists will not win. Freedom will win.” — ignores that Palestinian terrorism and Israeli occupation are reinforcing injustices, both of which stand in the way of peace.

Perhaps Mr. Biden’s bear hug will give him political cover to reinvigorate the pursuit of a two-state solution, last attempted by U.S. diplomats in the Obama administration. Mr. Biden recently said “there’s no going back” to the prewar status quo. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has called for the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, to govern Gaza after Israeli forces withdraw. That assumes Israel would sooner pull out than pay the price the Palestinian Authority would demand: serious progress toward a Palestinian state. To have any odds of success, the United States will have to threaten to reduce military assistance and political support and act accordingly. Otherwise Israel will conclude that U.S. talk is just that.

Don’t count on Mr. Biden to change. If he was unwilling to impose conditions on Israeli conduct at the outset, when it mattered most, he is unlikely to risk a breach with Israel, a popular cause in American politics, as next year’s presidential election nears. But he should — because the alternative is worse."

It would create an independent Palestinian state, made up of Gaza and the West Bank, that would exist alongside Israel. The goal has become official policy of most governments around the world and has been the basis for peace talks for years.

But as the Opinion video above shows, it has also become one of the most hollowed-out phrases in the Middle East — or anywhere. For all the shuttle diplomacy, summits and on-the-verge-of-success pronouncements, the goal remains frustratingly distant and, for many, dead.

That said, some faith in the idea somehow persists, even amid the worst fighting in the history of the conflict. In recent days, President Biden and his counterparts in Britain, France and elsewhere have newly championed the two-state solution as the best path toward peace. In the coming weeks and months, absent a more viable alternative, we’ll most likely be hearing the phrase again and again — and again."
360,360,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/04/world/middleeast/blinken-arab-ministers-gaza-airstrikes.html,"Anxious Arab leaders appealed publicly and privately on Saturday to Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken to rein in Israel’s military campaign in the Gaza Strip, increasing pressure on the Biden administration as it struggles to persuade Israel to reduce civilian casualties and allow in more humanitarian aid.

Civilian deaths have fueled a crescendo of anger in the region and beyond, and an Israeli bombing of a convoy of ambulances drew condemnation from the United Nations, which said “nowhere is safe” in the territory.

The depth of feeling among the Arab nations was evident in a news conference in Amman, Jordan, on Saturday evening where the country’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, bluntly told Mr. Blinken, “Stop this madness.” The Egyptian foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, called for an “immediate cease-fire” in Gaza without conditions.

U.S. officials said Arab leaders had delivered similarly stark messages to Mr. Blinken in private, reflecting concerns that growing public outrage over Israel’s actions could create instability in their own countries. They told Mr. Blinken that they could no longer bear domestic pressure over the high Palestinian death toll, and needed the Americans to act.

Those messages from Arab leaders on Saturday stood in contrast to what some of them privately told their American counterparts earlier in the conflict: that they were open to an aggressive Israeli campaign against Hamas, U.S. officials said.

Mr. Blinken responded to calls for an immediate cease-fire from Arab leaders by reiterating the United States’ position — that Israel had a right to defend itself but needed to minimize civilian casualties.

“It’s our view that a cease-fire now would simply leave Hamas in place and able to regroup and repeat what it did on Oct. 7.” Mr. Blinken said. “No nation — none of us — can accept that.”

It was not immediately clear how the alarm expressed by Arab leaders would affect the Biden administration’s calculations.

Mr. Blinken, who is on a tour of the Middle East, has led diplomatic efforts to persuade Israel to allow the entry of assistance for Gaza civilians trapped and desperate after nearly a month of war. He has also been the leading voice of the Biden administration in urging Israel to agree to a series of pauses in the fighting to facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza and the exit of foreign nationals from the enclave.

Mr. Netanyahu has rebuffed the idea, saying any pauses should be contingent on the release of all of the more than 240 Israeli hostages taken by Hamas, though U.S. officials said discussions were still underway and expressed hope that the Israelis would reverse their decision.

President Biden, asked by a reporter after emerging from Mass on Saturday in Rehoboth Beach, Del., if there was any progress on getting a humanitarian pause in Gaza, responded, “Yes,” and offered a thumbs up but no further details.

In a statement on Saturday night, a spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing asserted that the bodies of 23 hostages were missing under the rubble in Gaza after Israeli airstrikes, a claim that could not be independently verified. Israeli officials have dismissed such statements as “psychological warfare,” a Hamas attempt to sway Israeli public opinion by stoking fear for the fate of the hostages held in Gaza even as the battle in the enclave continues."

362,362,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/opinion/nyt-opinion-photo-palestinian-children.html,"Since the first use of photography to document battle in the Crimean War, there have been questions about the ethics of photojournalism in covering conflict and about how to regard the suffering of others depicted in that work.

In a haunting essay published today, the Opinion columnist Lydia Polgreen explores the power of photography to mold public perception of war not just across history but also, more intently, in the current conflict between Israel and Hamas. Lydia argues that one image in particular — of six small children killed on Oct. 22 by an Israeli bombardment in the central Gaza Strip — requires attention and answers.

I urge you to read Lydia’s wrenching, powerful description of the horror this photograph conveys. It is that horror that brought me to the difficult decision not to publish the image in full in Opinion’s report.

This kind of editorial judgment at The Times is informed by long-held standards about publishing journalism that is graphic in nature and might raise concerns for the families involved. But these decisions can also be subjective and are made on a case-by-case basis after significant discussion.

As editors, we ask a series of questions before publishing sensitive photos, such as: Does the image respect the dignity of the victims? Is it exploitative or gratuitous? Would you publish an equivalent photograph if you were closer to the victims or if it was taken in a different location? Does the image help describe the news event in a way that has more impact than reporting alone can do? Have you considered what the response of family or loved ones of the victims might be?

There are reasonable people who would argue, as Lydia does, that showing this specific photograph is necessary to offer moral clarity around the stakes of this war and the pain it is inflicting on civilians in Gaza. Others, including supporters of the Palestinian cause, would see the same image and suggest that publishing it risked dehumanizing the children it depicted. And still others could ask why Times Opinion has not published similar graphic photographs of the Israeli babies killed in the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks.

I thought about all these questions, and more, and ultimately chose to include an external link in Lydia’s column for those readers who wanted to see the full image.

For me, the tipping point was how clearly the viewer could identify each of these children. This is often one of the factors we use when children are in a photo, and we frequently try to get parents’ consent before publication. We were not able to reach the parents or families of these kids, and given the ongoing violence, they may even be deceased themselves. I could not imagine loved ones discovering that this image had been published in The Times without warning.

History will very likely determine if I made the right call. Until then, please take a minute to read Lydia’s beautiful counterargument.

From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise. And this is “The Daily.”

They broke the door of the hospital. They bombed thousands of people around, thousands of people, thousands.

Israel’s bombing campaign has become one of the most intense in the 21st century. Gazan health officials say the death toll now stands at more than 11,000 people, higher than all previous wars between Israel and Hamas combined. At the center of it all are doctors.

As Israel’s war on Hamas enters its sixth week, hospitals in Gaza have found themselves on the front lines. They are a refuge for growing numbers of civilians fleeing the violence. But one that has become increasingly dangerous as Israel’s military targets what it says are Hamas fighters hiding inside of them and beneath them.

Hi. Dr. Ahmed, this is Sabrina Tavernise from “The New York Times.” Hello Dr. Marwan Abusada?

“The Daily” has spent the past several weeks calling doctors all over the Gaza Strip, asking them what the war looks like from inside their hospitals.

[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] You hear the bombing now? You hear the bombing?

The attacks are continuous. They bombed a building, and then we get a gush of casualties coming, at least 40 or 50 at one time.

We work hard. We work more than 18 hours per day.

In the hospital. Sometimes in the office. Sometimes in the OR.

Where are you sleeping? Are you going home?

And what they are doing to keep up with the flood of patients.

I will show you just for one minute with the camera to see how many patients are waiting in the waiting room, just one minute, please.

Now, how many pictures as Israel’s military moves deeper into Gaza City, the war is pushing hospitals to the brink of collapse.

Its catastrophic situation, madam. You have to watch by yourself to see what I talk about.

Yeah. Yes, I must go. Excuse me. Yeah

Of course. Of course. So you need to go to a surgery right now?

He’s actually operating at the moment. Would you be able to call back in half an hour?

Around 1,600 to 1,700. But the hospital capacity is 600. So you can only imagine.

How many patients are at the hospital right now?

She needs an amputation, part of her shot. She’s six, taken from underneath the rubble.

It sounds like a child is in pain.

Can you tell me a little bit about where you are right now?

I’m good. How are you doing?

Hi, how are you?

The day she reached him, he was working at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, the largest hospital in the Gaza Strip. Israel’s army had not invaded Gaza yet, but its airstrikes had driven many from their homes. And Shifa had become a kind of refuge. Around 60,000 people were living there.

So I need to go.

I need to go. I need to go because the dad of the girl is here, and we need to tell him that we need to do the amputation.

This is carnage on an unfathomable scale.

This six-year-old girl needs an amputation to her foot. We’ll be taking her next to the operating room. It’s just been like that.

There’s very little that effectively you can say to them. And they’re absolutely petrified.

But these kids have been pulled from underneath the rubble. A lot of them have seen family being killed.

Everything is going to be all right even though it’s not going to be all right. You tell them that once the surgery is done, their parents will give them the best meal that they like or get them some ice cream or whatever.

What do you usually say to them?

Whimpering. Do you try to calm them? Do you try to talk them through?

He’s got over 60 percent burns. Burns to his face, to his hands, to his legs. He’s 13, 12, 13. He was just whimpering.

We had a seven-month-old with burns to his legs and arms. But we also had this child with facial burns yesterday, who doesn’t look like he’s going to do well.

I’ve just been operating all day. So burns, we brought in major burns patients. So patients with over 40 percent burns. We had a mother, her 11-year-old son, who has full thickness burns to his face and his arms. We had a mother with burns to her legs and to his arms.

And how many patients have you been able to see today? What have you done today?

Every available office, cupboard, storage room, corridor, whatever you can imagine.

And where are they sleeping?

Everybody’s sleeping here. And some people have brought their families.

In the operating room. Each operating room has a small area called recovery, where we put patients right after the surgery just to monitor them until the anesthetic wears out. And that recovery area is where I sleep.

Um-hmm. And are you sleeping in the hospital?

Across the hallway from my operating room door, there is a whole three generational family, grandmother, and parents, and siblings. And they have a little girl whose oxygen dependent. She’s like four and needs continuous oxygen. So they’re sitting next to an electric socket on the floor. There are some patients on mattresses with their injuries. It’s miserably grim. And the smell, it’s a public health catastrophe waiting to happen. This is cholera or typhus waiting to happen.

If you walk through the hospital, it’s turned into a tented city. On the floors at the entrance, there are families sitting. There are patients on the corridors, patients on mattresses in the floors of the — patients on trolleys, there are patients in the emergency room. It’s just — it’s surreal. It’s surreal how awful it is.

The day after we talked to Dr. Abu-Sitta, on Friday, October 27, all communications to Gaza were cut. No phone, no internet. It was about two days before we could reach anyone again. When we did, it had become clear that Israel had launched a ground invasion into Gaza. And the doctors we spoke to told us it felt like the war was getting even closer.

Last night was horrendous. The bombing was just and very close.

This is actually awful. We don’t want this to happen.

Are you worried about the Israeli military coming inside Gaza? There are forces coming closer to Gaza City now.

Israel maintains that the hospital conceals a major Hamas military compound, including passageways hidden underneath. It says the ambulance had hit, it was being used to transport Hamas fighters. It also said that Hamas is hoarding fuel. Hamas has denied all of this. When we asked doctors about it, some said it wasn’t true.

10 days ago, an Israeli airstrike hit an ambulance near the entrance of Shifa Hospital. Then on Friday, the courtyard inside the hospital complex was hit.

I mean, for me, it’s just a narrative to justify targeting the hospital. I mean, think about it is that under international law, it’s still a crime to attack a hospital regardless of who you say is underneath the ground.

Others said they didn’t know.

That their corridors were filling up even more with wounded and dying people.

All they knew was their reality in this war.

The sick children now, they don’t have clean water to drink. I received like water with yellow color.

Just as their supplies were running out.

Some patients may die because of infection in the wound. Why there is infection in the wound? Because there is lack of antibiotics.

They were running out of disinfectant and were resorting to what they had on hand.

One of the scenes I have witnessed is seeing chloride using in the wiping the floors or wiping the windows. We use it for the cleaning of wound infections. Other example I have seen, nurses and doctors using vinegar to treat wound infections. And I am sure it is not enough. It will not treat anything.

They said they were running out of medicine to operate on people.

MSF released a photo. It was an amputation of the foot of a little boy on the ground with no general anesthesia. So he was just given some sedative to fall asleep. Part of what we do as doctors is relieve suffering. And if you can’t treat patients with pain control, it’s —

They started rationing everything, particularly fuel to run the generators. So many turned off the lights in their hospitals.

The wards are dark. The corridors are dark. The communal areas, the lobby, the stairwells, they’re dark. And so it’s a nightmare because you don’t know who you’re stepping on while you’re walking.

Some said they were even operating on people using their phone flashlights.

Yeah, yeah. That’s basically it. That’s the trick. You use light from your phone.

Do you use light from your phone? How do you see?

And they worried about how much time they had left.

I’m trying to find fuel for ambulances and electricity.

A hospital without fuel, this hospital without fuel and electricity will turn from a hospital into a mass grave.

And some of those we talked to were spending much of their days trying to find fuel themselves, including Dr. Suhaib Al-hamss, the general director of the Kuwaiti Specialist Hospital in Rafart in the South of Gaza.

I hope that her cousin will take care of her.

One of the nurses just stay with here until the morning. And after that, it went with one of her families, one of her cousin.

She lost all of her family. And she was shocked. She was shocked. No exhibition. Just was silent.

Just I cried. The only thing I can do just to cry. Cry when I fall asleep, crying when I’m working. Just I cried. Nothing to be done for them. Nothing to be done. Nothing to be spoken. Of the children, one of them was nine year daughters. She lost her mother.

What was it like for you when you discovered you couldn’t save the babies inside the mothers?

And we tried — after they killed, we try to do cesarean section after they are killed, the ER, trying to save their babies. But we cannot do that. Unfortunately, the fetus was killed also. We tried to save it. We tried.

I’m angry. I am exhausted. This is a bad dream. I hope I worked from it. Just today, we received about 12 children and women, pregnant women. Two of them are pregnant. Where is the hospital dead. They were killed.

Do you hear about the lots of children, and women, and pregnant women, and honest citizens that were killed by the Israeli occupation and the whole world the whole world that they call them the democracy, the democracy world just watch us? Nothing. Do nothing, just support Israel, support Israel. This is genocide here. I wonder how they can do this. They stole our life. They stole our life. We have dreams. We have children. We have our own dreams. They stole everything. They destroyed everything.

I didn’t hear about that. I hear from the Israeli occupation. I didn’t hear about that except from the Israeli occupation. You hear that lots of doctor of professors, consultants, and medical students were killed here. Do you hear about the ambulances that were destroyed by the Israeli occupation? Do you hear about the hospitals that were destroyed the patient?

One thing that we have heard doctor is that there are reports that Hamas had been sitting on a stockpile of fuel in the underground tunnels. Is that something that you’ve heard about? Does that —

One thing that we have —

You should deal with that. You should —

One thing that we have heard, doctor —

You cannot ask me about Hamas, about Jihad, about — you should ask me the medical — you can ask Israel what they are doing here. They are killed lots of honest people. I won’t answer. Anyone, you ask me about the political situation here. You talk about humanity. You talk about catastrophic situation here in Gaza, madam.

Madam, you cannot ask me about Hamas. I am a doctor. I am associate professor here. I am the head of surgery department in the faculty of medicine.

And what about Hamas, doctor? You mentioned you’re calling the Ministry of Health. Does Hamas help you with fuel?

That’s what happened here. But we have no options. We cannot leave our patient. We cannot leave our hospital here.

You don’t have bread for the staff?

Lots of calls. Yes, that’s where I spent my day just looking for water, for food, for fuel for my medical staff here. We don’t have even a bread for the last two days for the medical staff.

How many calls did you make about fuel today for your hospital?

I spent my days since 6:00 AM trying to call everyone, call the Norway, call international — I call the minister of health. I called — I’m trying to find other hospitals if they can help me. I will stop my service here. The patients will die.

Doctors also said that they found themselves in a strange new role.

As the days went on, the war was forcing doctors to make impossible choices, who would get treatment and who wouldn’t, who got anesthesia and who didn’t, which wounds got disinfectant and which did not. A number of doctors talked about making the most impossible choice of all, whom to save and whom to let die. One doctor told us that it felt as if he was deciding on the souls of people.

- So they keep on like running beside me, following me. Please, we want to draw. Please take photo for us.

Two days ago, we got a patient with no one of her family alive.

She came alone. 11-year-old. She was disoriented. No one knows the name. And she was in the recovery with no beds. The general manager of the hospital called me and said, I know this is not your case, but please can you take care of this little girl? She has no one here.

One doctor said that for children who were too young to speak, the staff would write unknown in marker on their bodies.

Every day, we had a lot of cases like this. Lots of children lost their mothers, their fathers without families.

Some said their hospitals were starting to feel like orphanages with children wandering the halls, looking for parents who were no longer alive.

Yes. And it happens every hour. I have seen dozens or even hundreds of WCNSF.

Even there is a new medical term that we are having. It must be added to medical books. WCNSF.

Ebraheem Matar is a resident ICU doctor at Al-aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the middle of the Gaza Strip.

sabrina tavernise

And what happens to these children? Where do they go? Who cares for them after they get better?

ebraheem matar

Who cares for them, actually there is no answer for this question. We don’t even know their names sometimes. So who will care for them? So far, no one. I have seen two kids who are severely injured. Those two kids do not know that their father and mother and all their siblings have died. They were unconscious at the time of the bombing. And now, they are conscious. They are receiving treatment. But simply, they do not know. And all the people around them did not tell them in order they are kids and they cannot handle the pain of the injury or the psychological pain of the grief.

sabrina tavernise

How old are the kids?

ebraheem matar

The first is 13-year-old female who is having a severe comminuted fracture. The other, her brother, is a 14-year-old who is having a severe head trauma and a brain hemorrhage. But now, they are both conscious and receiving treatment. And they do not know that their family, father, and mother, siblings, house, all are destroyed. Just we tell them that, you are going to see them soon. Just in order not to make them feel sad. It is painful, hiding the truth. It is to some sort of deceiving. But sometimes, you may do things that are not appropriate at that moment and may be appropriate later.

sabrina tavernise

Yeah. That must be so hard Dr. Matar.

ebraheem matar

Yes, it is. Pain is too intense here. This is an ambulance is coming.

sabrina tavernise

Oh, what is that in the background?

ebraheem matar

Now, it is a new casualty. And many paramedics are doing CPR. And it is for a child. Yes, it is for a child.

sabrina tavernise

What are you looking at?

ebraheem matar

Many paramedics are rushing the child into the emergency department, and they are doing CPR. It is a wounded child. And it seems there is no surviving family.

sabrina tavernise

WCNSF.

ebraheem matar

Yes.

sabrina tavernise

How old is the child?

ebraheem matar

It looks like 10 years old.

sabrina tavernise

What’s happening now?

ebraheem matar

People, doctors and paramedics in the hospital are speaking about a new bombing. And there is dozens of new casualties are in the — some time, and they will reach the hospital. And new cases, we are now waiting new cases.

sabrina tavernise

How are you feeling?

ebraheem matar

I did not go home since the start of the conflict. So I feel tired emotionally, physically, mentally, and on all aspects. I did not see my family since 7 October.

sabrina tavernise

Where is your family?

ebraheem matar

They are in the North of Gaza Strip. They did not leave the North.

sabrina tavernise

Are they OK?

ebraheem matar

Thankfully, yes. They are OK. So far, I don’t know what is happening later. And I feel very anxious about them. And every time in the hospital, I think of them, and I hope they are fine.

sabrina tavernise

Dr. Matar, is the child OK? What is happening with that child?

ebraheem matar

I may enter the department and ask about them. Just give me a few seconds.

sabrina tavernise

OK.

ebraheem matar

Stay on the line. [INDISTINCT CHATTERS] Hello.

sabrina tavernise

Hi.

ebraheem matar

Yes, I’ve seen the kid. The one who is being brought by the ambulance.

sabrina tavernise

Is he OK?

ebraheem matar

No, he’s not OK. He’s having a severe head trauma. We could see the brain matter through the wound.

sabrina tavernise

You could see his brain through the wound?

ebraheem matar

She’s still alive. But she’s having what doctors say brain death. He’s unconscious. He’s having a large crack in his head. So we are now, as doctors in the ER department, are thinking of giving him assisted mechanical ventilation or not. So the IC doctors in charge may not intubate him because they may think this is a hopeless case. Because if they did, there will no any good result. So this is now a situation of choosing between which cases will benefit from treatment or not.

sabrina tavernise

Your colleagues are deciding whether to try to save him?

ebraheem matar

Yes.

sabrina tavernise

And that must be such a difficult choice.

ebraheem matar

It is.

sabrina tavernise

What is your biggest fear at this moment?

ebraheem matar

In this conflict, the first thing is that I don’t want to die in cold blood. I am an innocent person. The second thing is I’m afraid on my family. I don’t want my family to get injured or to die. Because they are also innocent. We are afraid on our families more than we are afraid on ourselves. And we don’t just want to die in cold blood.

sabrina tavernise

What do you mean we don’t want to die in cold blood?

ebraheem matar

I mean that we are not targets. We are not targets. We, as normal civilian, humans, we need a ceasefire. We need the conflict to end and to have a normal life. A normal life that includes staying safe at home, drinking clean water, seeing my friends, doing picnics, sleep in a calm room, sleep without the sounds of bombings, going to work, returning back from work, playing football or soccer with my friends, going to the beach. Every day, I used to go there and smell a breeze of the beach and listen to the sounds of waves, listen to music. I missed listening to music. I’m a music lover. And I love poetry. I miss writing about love, about dreams. I was going to the gym before the conflict started. I miss going to the gym. Actually, the gym I go to has been destroyed today. I don’t know why. So I’m just going to the gym.

sabrina tavernise

How old are you, Dr. Matar?

ebraheem matar

I am 27 years old. I’m still a young doctor.

sabrina tavernise

You are.

ebraheem matar

Just I need normal life back. Now, I can see the child who I told you about is being taken to the place of dead people.

sabrina tavernise

You see the child being taken where?

ebraheem matar

Into the place of dead people.

sabrina tavernise

Oh. They took the child you told me about to the morgue?

ebraheem matar

Yes. My friend who was working with him, he is giving me a sign that he’s dead. It is sad. It is very sad. Because a young child.

sabrina tavernise

Yeah. A young child. What is your friend doing now?

ebraheem matar

He returned to the ER department to see new casualties. There is no time to get sad over every case. Thank you for giving me the chance to listen to me.

sabrina tavernise

Thank you for sharing yourself.

ebraheem matar

You’re welcome, my friend. It’s my privilege. Good night and wish a good night for me also.

sabrina tavernise

Be safe tonight.

364,364,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/opinion/gaza-war-children-photo.html,"If you don’t look too closely you might think the photograph is a dimly lit snapshot from a slumber party or a family camping trip. Six small children lie in a row, their heads poking out from the white sheet that is casually lying across their little chests. None appear to be older than 10, though it is hard to say for sure.

At first, you might not notice the smear of drying blood in the upper right hand corner of the image. But then you do, and then it is impossible not to see that one child, second from the left, appears to be missing a chunk of skull. When you now look with your full attention, the horror of this tableau takes shape, and you see that only one child — a girl with a ponytail, probably 8 or 9 years old — looks even remotely as if she is sleeping. Her head is turned slightly, as if she had been drowsily whispering something to the girl beside her.

Then you might see the terse caption, which reads: “The bodies of children killed in an Israeli strike lie on the floor at the morgue of Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip on Oct. 22, 2023, as battles continue between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas group.” The caption comes from Agence France-Presse; the photo from Mahmud Hams, a staff photographer there.

The children are not named. The photograph tells us nothing about whether or how these children are related. All we can know is that they are six of the more than 4,500 children who have been killed in Gaza, according to its Ministry of Health, since Israel began its military campaign in response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. On that day, Hamas fighters slaughtered 1,200 people, among them many children. Hundreds of Israeli hostages, including children, are believed to be held in Gaza by Hamas, their families desperate for their safe release.

This photograph has not been published by a mainstream news organization, so far as I can tell. Because of its graphic nature, The Times has decided not to publish it in full; this column is accompanied by a cropped version of the image. The full image can be seen here. It is a rare thing for mainstream news organizations to publish graphic images of dead or wounded children. Rightly so. There is nothing quite so devastating as the image of a child whose life has been snuffed out by senseless violence. The longstanding norms are to show such images sparingly, if at all.

Of course, the news media no longer needs to disseminate an image for it to be seen. Social media bludgeons us with a flood of brutal images. And in a long reporting career that has taken me to many war zones, I have seen more than my share of death in real life. I’ve gone to these places because I believe deeply in bearing witness to all facets of the human experience, including war and suffering. One of the hardest parts of journalism is witnessing horror and then trying, in words, sound and image, to convey that pain to the wider world. Many people may want to look away, to see the world as they prefer to see it. But what should we see when we see war? What should war demand all of us to see and understand? Given my experience in war zones, it is a rare thing for a violent image to stop me in my tracks. But I believe that this is an image that demands to be seen.

When the news media does choose to publish these images, they can be galvanizing. Emmett Till’s mother insisted that his brutalized body be photographed so the world would be forced to bear witness to his lynching. The photograph of Kim Phuc Phan Thi, the screaming child burned by napalm captured in Nick Ut’s indelible image, has often been credited as helping turn sentiment against the American war in Vietnam, though that turn had arguably already begun. In 2015, the lifeless body of Aylan Kurdi, a Syrian toddler, was photographed washed up on a Turkish beach. He had drowned, along with his mother, in attempting to sail from Turkey to Europe. The image brought a flood of attention and donations to the victims of the Syrian civil war, and for a time may have softened hearts that have long since rehardened against the plight of refugees seeking safety from war and oppression.

Like many people, I have been struggling to come to grips with the scale and devastation of the conflict unfolding right now in Gaza. Hamas’s heinous attack on Israel was a rampage of unrelenting brutality and cruelty that the killers live-streamed. Israel has responded with a bombing campaign in Gaza that “has become one of the most intense of the 21st century, prompting growing global scrutiny of its scale, purpose and cost to human life,” The Times reported.

In the early days of this conflict I wrote that I hoped that President Biden would use his hard-won experience and willingness to speak impolitic but necessary truths to temper the Israeli response. His administration has become more critical of the Israeli military campaign in Gaza in recent days, but Biden has also cast the huge death toll as inevitable, saying, “I’m sure innocents have been killed, and it’s the price of waging a war.”

Many have rightly criticized those on the far left across the globe who lionize Hamas, or excuse the horrific violence visited upon defenseless men, women and children on the grounds that all Jewish Israelis are somehow legitimate military targets because of the actions of their government or, worse still, because of the actions and decisions of those who created the state of Israel 75 years ago in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Defenses of the atrocities of Oct. 7 on these grounds are repugnant. Collective blame is morally wrong.

But as the days grind on and the death toll mounts, it is hard not to conclude that Israel’s government and its defenders are willing to subject the Palestinians of Gaza to collective punishment for the actions of those who rule them without their assent.

If there was doubt about the sentiment among Palestinians in Gaza regarding Hamas’s rule, a survey completed in Gaza the day before the Oct. 7 assault on Israel gave a useful glimpse into how unpopular the group is. The overwhelming majority of the respondents in Gaza said they had no or very little trust in Hamas, and a plurality blamed the Hamas-led government for shortages of food, rather than external factors like the Israeli and Egyptian blockade. Just 27 percent said that Hamas was their preferred political party. Hamas last won an election in 2006; it has not held another.

Hamas calls for the destruction of the state of Israel, but the poll found that 54 percent of people in Gaza supported the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as outlined by the Oslo Accords, and nearly three-quarters said they supported a peaceful resolution to the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Which brings me back to the image that has haunted me since I first laid eyes on it. What did the children in this photograph believe? It is a pointless question. They are children. And so we must look at them, the promise of their future lives broken, never to be wakened from the sleep of death. Children are not a metaphor for the future. They are the future.

But it is fair to wonder whether such a brutal photograph can do more than shock, temporarily. In her scathing 1977 book “On Photography,” Susan Sontag was not kind to the medium.

“To suffer is one thing; another thing is living with the photographed images of suffering, which does not necessarily strengthen conscience and the ability to be compassionate,” she wrote. “It can also corrupt them. Once one has seen such images, one has started down the road of seeing more — and more. Images transfix. Images anesthetize.”

In 2003, the year before her death, Sontag wrote “Regarding the Pain of Others,” another slender volume that was preoccupied with photography. The intervening years had changed her. She had gone to Bosnia, spending time with war photographers in Sarajevo. She lived through the aftermath of 9/11, watching in horror as her country launched itself heedlessly into wars of vengeance. She made a life with a famous photographer.

Her view of the photography of political violence became more nuanced, if not softer. Images, she wrote, “cannot be more than an invitation to pay attention, to reflect, to learn, to examine the rationalizations for mass suffering offered by established powers. Who caused what the picture shows? Who is responsible? Is it excusable? Was it inevitable? Is there some state of affairs which we have accepted up to now that ought to be challenged?”

Scrolling through a database of unpublished graphic images by photojournalists of injured and dead children in Gaza, I often had the impulse to look away. This photograph had the opposite effect. It made me want to look deeper. Perhaps it is the sleight-of-hand way this gruesome image of bodies placed on the floor of a hospital morgue evokes a cellphone snapshot of the peaceful slumber of children. Perhaps it is the classic composition — two-thirds of the screen is taken up with a white sheet whose intricate crinkles are worthy of a Dutch master. Mostly it was because, as Sontag said, the photograph required me to ask a question: What set of arrangements, what assumptions, must be overturned to answer for this tableau of death?

It was perhaps fitting that the crisis in Gaza and Israel was pushed off the top of the American news agenda, albeit briefly, by a mass shooting in Maine. The story was so awful in its familiarity. The gunman had been known to law enforcement. Warnings about him were ignored. He of course enjoyed unfettered access to machines that kill. In his rampage he killed 18 people, including 14-year-old Aaron Young, a passionate bowler who was gunned down with his father while attending a youth league game.

We don’t see graphic images of dead American children from mass shootings, in part because photojournalists do not generally have access to these horrific scenes, and authorities do not release crime scene photos. In their place we often substitute images of maternal anguish. And so the slaughter in Maine reminded me of another image from Gaza, one you may have seen on social media. In it, a female figure cradles the body of a child swathed in white cloth. The photograph shows no faces — indeed the only hint of flesh is the woman’s hand, which clutches the child’s head. The woman’s head is covered with a scarf, a practice that at various times and places in history has been shared by devout women of all the Abrahamic faiths. The original Reuters caption told us little: “A woman embraces the body of a Palestinian child killed in Israeli strikes, at a hospital in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.” It was taken by a Reuters photographer in Gaza named Mohammed Salem.

Later, Reuters reported that the woman, Inas Abu Maamar, was holding the body of her 5-year-old niece, Saly. But the image requires no words, no faces, no names to transmit, inescapably, a profound and universal grief. The image instantly recalls one of the most famous works of art in the world: Michelangelo’s La Pietà. The marble sculpture depicts Mary holding the lifeless body of Jesus after he is taken down from the cross. It is the ultimate symbol of maternal grief, of the sacrifice of a child to a cruel world. In her agony she could be any mother, grieving any child stolen too soon, anywhere in the world.

And so I ask you to look at these children. They are not asleep. They are dead. They will not be part of the future. But know this: The children in the morgue photo could be any children. They could be Sudanese children caught in the crossfire between two feuding generals in Khartoum. They could be Syrian children crushed under Bashar al-Assad’s bombs. They could be Turkish children who died in their beds when a shoddily constructed apartment block collapsed upon them in an earthquake. They could be Ukrainian children slain by Russian shells. They could be Israeli children slaughtered in a kibbutz by Hamas. They could be American schoolchildren gunned down in a mass shooting. These children are ours."
365,365,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/world/europe/suella-braverman-uk-home-secretary-controversy.html,"Suella Braverman has embraced controversy in her time as a senior member of the Conservative government.

A hard-right, divisive politician, Ms. Braverman, 43, has now been fired from the home secretary’s position twice, once on Monday by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and once by his predecessor, Liz Truss.

The home secretary is responsible for law enforcement, immigration and national security, but Ms. Braverman’s hard-line stance on those issues has often stoked divisive cultural debates in Britain because of her inflammatory rhetoric.

Her staunch policies on immigration, including plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, have been denounced by rights groups, criticized by opposition politicians, and challenged in the country’s highest courts.

Here’s a look at some of Ms. Braverman’s most prominent disputes.

A damaging email breach.

Ms. Braverman was first appointed home secretary in September 2022 by Ms. Truss — whose term as prime minister became the shortest in British history — but was fired less than two months later for a security breach.

Using her personal email address, she had sent a government document to another lawmaker who was not authorized to see it. Despite her dismissal, Ms. Braverman was again appointed home secretary six days later, on Mr. Sunak’s first day in office.

That decision was criticized not only by the opposition but by lawmakers on Parliament’s public administration and constitutional affairs committee, which later issued a report detailing how the “leaking of restricted material is worthy of significant sanction.” A “subsequent change in prime minister should not wipe the slate clean,” the report added.

A tenure of divisive rhetoric.

Throughout her time in office, Ms. Braverman has often proved a divisive figure, with comments that have infuriated opposition politicians, drawn the condemnation of rights groups and religious leaders and even been decried by some members of her own party.

Last year, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, joined a number of other religious leaders who denounced her description of the asylum seekers arriving on Britain’s southern coast as an “invasion.”"
367,367,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/12/us/politics/us-airstrikes-syria.html,"The United States conducted a new round of airstrikes against facilities used by Iran and its proxies in eastern Syria late Sunday in retaliation for a spate of recent attacks against American troops, Pentagon officials said on Sunday.

Officials said the strikes most likely killed or injured an undetermined number of people at the sites.

The airstrikes appeared to be an escalation by the Biden administration, which had previously conducted two sets of strikes that officials said were meant to deter Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the militias it supports in Syria and Iraq. U.S. officials had said those strikes had caused no known casualties.

On Sunday night, Air Force F-15E fighter jets struck several buildings in Abu Kamal used for training, logistics and storing munitions, as well as a safe house in Mayadin used as a command headquarters, the officials said. The strikes came just four days after American warplanes hit a munitions warehouse in eastern Syria. Another set of retaliatory strikes by the United States came on Oct. 27.

U.S. officials blame Iran and the militias aligned with it for what has become a daily barrage of rocket and drone attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria.

But President Biden had in recent weeks rejected more aggressive bombing options proposed by the Pentagon out of fear of provoking a wider conflict with Iran. Republican critics in Congress and some air power advocates have said a narrow White House response has only invited more frequent and more dangerous attacks against U.S. troops in the region.

Pentagon and other Biden administration officials rejected that criticism on Sunday, saying that the latest American airstrikes were intended to disrupt the militias’ activities and to put their personnel at risk, not just their munitions or buildings.

“The president has no higher priority than the safety of U.S. personnel, and he directed today’s action to make clear that the United States will defend itself, its personnel and its interests,” Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said in a statement while traveling in Asia. In a news conference in Seoul on Monday, he reiterated that the United States would continue to do what was necessary to protect its troops.

Pentagon officials said that fewer than a dozen Iran-backed militia personnel were present at the bombed sites on Sunday and that some were likely to have been killed or injured in the attack. American analysts were unable to provide a more precise casualty estimate.

The Pentagon said on Sunday that there had been at least 48 attacks against U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq since Oct. 17 and that at least 56 U.S. service members had been injured. About half of them suffered traumatic brain injuries, and two had to be flown to Landstuhl military hospital in Germany for treatment.

The United States has 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria, mostly to help local forces fight remnants of the Islamic State.

The United States has been shifting military assets to the Middle East since Hamas’s surprise attack against Israel on Oct. 7 to try to prevent a regional war that could drag U.S. forces into conflict with Iranian proxies in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria.

It has deployed one aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean near Israel, and another recently left the Red Sea and is sailing toward the Arabian Sea. The Pentagon has also sent dozens of additional warplanes to the Persian Gulf region, as well as additional Patriot antimissile batteries and other air defenses to several Gulf nations to protect U.S. troops and bases in the region.

These air defenses so far have mostly been successful in knocking down incoming threats to American military personnel, but U.S. military officials said that troops have been lucky that none have been killed as the attacks have increased.

“It is quite clear that Iran and its proxy groups are escalating against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria, and we have a range of options at our disposal to defend ourselves,” Dana Stroul, the Pentagon’s top Middle East policy official, told a House committee last week."

The Palestinian Red Crescent said yesterday that Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City was “no longer operational,” as power outages and shortages of fuel continued to wreak havoc on Gaza’s health facilities. The Gazan aid group said that more than 14,000 displaced people had been sheltering there.

The announcement meant another hospital unavailable to Gazans. Four others that are adjacent to one another — the Rantisi children’s hospital, Al-Nasr Hospital and two additional medical centers — were evacuated on Friday. Israel’s ground invasion has been slowly closing in on the facilities, which have provided refuge for tens of thousands of civilians. Israel says the sites are shielding Hamas military operations in tunnels below.

Conditions at Gaza’s main hospital, Al-Shifa, are also dire. Thousands of seriously ill and wounded patients and displaced people have been trapped inside, while Israeli tanks and troops surround the compound. Snipers occasionally fire off shots, according to Gaza’s health ministry, doctors and some witnesses sheltering inside. Nearby, there is intense, close-quarter combat.

The World Health Organization said yesterday that it had lost communication with its contacts at Al-Shifa, where the Gaza health ministry said a day earlier that at least five wounded patients — including a premature baby in an incubator — had died as a result of the power outage."
369,369,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/12/world/europe/france-antisemitism-march.html,"More than 100,000 demonstrators in Paris and cities across France took to the streets on Sunday to show their solidarity with the country’s Jews and to deplore antisemitic acts that have multiplied across the nation since Hamas’s attack on Israel on Oct. 7.

The marches were called by the leaders of both houses of the French Parliament, the Senate and the National Assembly, and unfolded under gray skies mostly without incident, with 3,000 police officers in Paris alone patrolling the route. The marches in France came a day after a huge pro-Palestinian protest in London that police said involved about 300,000 people.

Tensions have been rising in France and particularly in Paris, home to large Jewish and Muslim communities, after Hamas’s attack and during Israel’s subsequent military campaign in the Gaza Strip. In the past month, over 1,240 antisemitic acts have been reported in France. The police had made 539 arrests as of Nov. 10.

President Emmanuel Macron condemned “the unbearable resurgence of unbridled antisemitism” in France in an open letter published in Le Parisien newspaper on Saturday, and said there would be “no tolerance for the intolerable.”

He added: “A France where our Jewish citizens are afraid is not France.”

French presidents typically do not participate in such marches, and Mr. Macron said that while he would not be present, he would be there “in my heart and in my thoughts.”"

But an American friend convinced him to write about his brother and channel his grief into something productive. Together, they founded We Are Not Numbers, a project that trains young writers in Gaza and publishes their personal essays in English.

The name is a nod to how numbing numbers can be. The higher the death toll, the less we are inclined to care, since the scale of human suffering can feel overwhelming. Statistics don’t trigger empathy and action. Personal stories do.

“This project changed my life because for the first time, I thought that some people can care about us,” Mr. Alnaouq said, describing the response it got outside Gaza.

We Are Not Numbers began as a way to memorialize the dead, but it quickly turned into a lifeline for the living. For young people in Gaza, stuck in a political system with few rights and a blockaded economy with few jobs, it provides a vital outlet for self-expression. More than 350 people have participated since it began. They have written about falling in love in a time of war (“I’m afraid of being the next dead bride”), about sculpture (“turning bullets into art”) and money (“The life cycle of the Palestinian graduate”). They have contributed pieces about longing to leave Gaza and longing to return."

The military also said that Hamas had an extensive tunnel network in Jabaliya.

On Wednesday, Dr. Abu Safyia said, he was working with a colleague in the hospital’s neonatal intensive-care unit — one of two units that still had power amid a severe fuel shortage — when casualties from Jabaliya started arriving.

When they rushed down to the emergency room to help, he said, his colleague was stunned to see that two of her own children were among the dead. Her 9-year-old and 7-year-old had been killed in their home, he said, along with several of her siblings and relatives.

“We are working at a place where at any moment we expect our children, spouses, siblings or friends to come in in pieces,” he said.

Some children could not be identified because of the severity of their injuries, he said. The hospital’s morgue was so full that people were stacking bodies on top of one another.

“We wish for death,” said Dr. Abu Safyia. “It is easier than seeing the horrific scenes we’re witnessing.”

He later added: “Live images are being broadcast to the whole world of people blown up into pieces, of women and children who are being murdered, for what? What did they do wrong?”

The hospital, which is in the city of Beit Lahia, just north of Jabaliya, was running extremely low on medical supplies, like all others in the Gaza Strip, he said. With no anesthesia, doctors were operating on people with severe injuries using over-the-counter painkillers like paracetamol to help ease the pain. They had a limited supply of antibiotics and were using vinegar and chlorine to disinfect wounds, the doctor added.

“The children’s screams during surgeries can be heard from outside,” Dr. Abu Safyia said. “We are operating on people’s skulls without anesthesia.”"

The West Bank, an area many times the size of Gaza and complicated in its own way, is once again a flashpoint, and all sides are clearly on edge.

While the world is increasingly critical of Israel for its bombardment of Gaza, deep concern is also rising about the actions of the Israeli military and Jewish settlers in the West Bank, a contested patchwork of Palestinian areas and Israeli settlements like Tekoa that most of the world considers illegal.

Jewish settlers of all political stripes are arming themselves, and extremists among them have attacked Palestinians and driven hundreds off their land.

At the same time, there have been more Israeli military raids, more violent protests, more arrests and more Palestinian attacks on Israelis this past month than there have been in any similar period in years."

In this fraught moment, dishes like hummus have become weaponized like never before.

American scholars of Jewish food describe the country’s cuisine as an amalgam of recipes brought to Israel by the global Jewish diaspora and merged with Middle Eastern food cooked by local Jews and Arabs. Some supporters of Palestine argue that Israeli cooks are colonizers who have adopted certain Arabic dishes as their own, and thus contribute to the erasure of Palestinian culture.

Nearly 900 chefs, farmers and others in the American food business have signed a pledge with an organization called Hospitality for Humanity, which a group of Palestinian chefs and political organizers began in October to push for a cease-fire and the end to U.S. support for Israel. They want to use a boycott of Israel-based food businesses and culinary events that promote Israel as one way to apply pressure.

Among the signatories are farmers, prominent chefs like Mason Hereford of Turkey and the Wolf in New Orleans, and food writers, including Helen Rosner of The New Yorker; the cookbook author and former New York Times food columnist Samin Nosrat; Stephen Satterfield, the founder of Whetstone magazine and the host of Netflix’s “High on the Hog”; and Ms. Kassis, who has written for The Times.

Palestinian food businesses in the United States report having been flooded with one-star reviews online, and Israeli restaurants in a few cities beyond Philadelphia have been tagged for boycotts on social media.

“We tend to think of food as humanizing but when there is conflict, food becomes part of the conflict,” said Ari Ariel, an associate professor at the University of Iowa who has written about and lectured on what he calls the Hummus Wars. The battle began in 2009, when Lebanon claimed Israel was trying to steal its national dish, turning the dip of sesame paste and chickpeas into an avatar of hostilities in the Middle East.

Lebanese officials sought to have the word hummus declared a protected designation in the European Union like Champagne or Parmigiano-Reggiano, and the tensions were made literal in a contest between Israel and Lebanon to make a tub of hummus big enough to break a world record. Lebanon took the title after spreading a 23,042-pound serving onto a giant ceramic plate in 2010.

“We have this romantic idea that if we eat the same food and break the same bread somehow we can come together, but that doesn’t seem to be the case here,” said Dr. Ariel, who is currently researching the origins of falafel."
374,374,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/world/europe/mob-riot-dagestan-airport-telegram.html,"A false rumor about the resettlement of Israelis in Dagestan that incited a violent mob at its capital airport Sunday was shared online for longer and more widely than previously reported, according to a New York Times analysis of Telegram posts.

The false narrative was spread across multiple, popular Dagestani Telegram channels in the two and a half weeks before the riot, illustrating the power and danger of disinformation in areas far from the Israel-Gaza war.

It appears to have been first sparked by a Russian regional airline resuming flights between Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, and Tel Aviv following a pause after the Hamas attacks in Israel. The first flight arrived on the evening of Oct. 11.

That same day, several Telegram channels falsely claimed that a group of Israeli refugees had arrived. Five of these posts on Oct. 11 and 12 were collectively viewed over 250,000 times. There is no indication that there have been any efforts to resettle Israelis to Dagestan.

At 2:27 a.m. on Oct. 12, a photo was posted on the Telegram channel Voice of Dagestan showing two dozen men with a large Palestinian flag and the caption, “The Israeli flight was met with Palestinian flags at the Makhachkala airport.” Although the photo doesn’t appear to have been posted online before Oct. 12, and it was taken at the airport, it was not possible to verify with certainty the date the photo was captured, or whether a protest actually took place. But the post was viewed nearly 140,000 times. And in the next four hours, similar posts with the same photo were shared on two other Telegram channels, with 123,000 and 64,000 followers each.

The rumor cropped up again on Oct. 23, when an Instagram account that covers local news in Derbent, the city home to most of the region’s small Jewish population, published a post from a reader suggesting that Dagestan welcome back the Jews who emigrated from the country to Israel. A Telegram channel then shared a screenshot of the post, along with a message to users that used degrading language, calling them to report any Jews who arrived in Dagestan “under the guise of being refugees,” and refuse to sell them any goods or rent them apartments. “These scum should hear this everywhere they go,” a message on the channel said.

The rumor spread amid rising anger over the Israel-Hamas war. In the majority Muslim region, nearly every popular Dagestani Telegram channel reviewed by The Times was dominated by posts about the conflict supporting Palestinians.

In the days leading up to the riot, users began threatening violence, and the anger metastasized into online and offline antisemitic actions against Jewish people. Some people pressured local businesses to ban Jewish customers. Hundreds of people called to action online showed up in person to mob a hotel where a person claimed that a Jewish person was staying."
375,375,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/world/middleeast/israel-invasion-gaza-hamas.html,"Hamas’s political leaders are striking a defiant tone. Ghazi Hamad, one of the top leaders, said the group would carry out further attacks on Israel until the nation was annihilated. On Thursday, Hamas released footage that it said showed its fighters firing a grenade launcher at an Israeli tank. Hamas is also demanding fuel deliveries as a condition of releasing hostages, even as the United Nations said the group was stockpiling fuel.

Hamas has confirmed the deaths of some of its middle- and top-ranking commanders in recent assaults, but denied Israeli claims that other top officers had been killed.

After three consecutive days of Israeli airstrikes in the Jabaliya neighborhood of northern Gaza, rescuers were searching for survivors in the rubble of collapsed buildings. Those airstrikes killed and wounded more than 1,000 people, including many children, according to the Hamas controlled Gazan health ministry. As the death tolls rises in these and other assaults, demands for a cease-fire have been growing around the world.

Mr. Blinken, who met Mr. Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Friday, repeated President Biden’s call for pauses in the campaign. The secretary of state said it would facilitate the delivery of aid to civilians and could help the 240 people held by Hamas to be freed and removed from Gaza.

“We recognize this would take time to prepare,” Mr. Blinken said at a news conference, noting that Hamas must not allowed to take advantage of a pause in the fighting. He offered no details on the timing or the duration of the proposed pauses, and indicated that this was still being hashed out with the Israelis.

While those discussions are ongoing, Israeli forces have cut Gaza in half, having raced across the strip from east to west and reached the Mediterranean Sea on Tuesday. Israel now controls the center of Gaza, a less-settled area with scattered refugee camps. The troops have cut the main north-south roads to Gaza City, depriving Hamas of equipment, vehicles and other reinforcements carried above ground. But many of the tunnels remain intact.

The loss of Gaza’s internet and phone service in the early phase of the operation likely hampered Hamas commanders’ ability to gather intelligence from the field or to communicate with their political leaders in Lebanon. It also helped prevent them from broadcasting images of the assault to the world, which could have raised pressure on Israel to stop.

Yet it deepened the crisis for civilians in Gaza. The death toll from airstrikes has risen to more than 9,000, according to the Gazan health ministry. Hospitals in the strip are running out of fuel and basic supplies, and some doctors say they have had to perform surgery without anesthesia.

The humanitarian disaster is raising tensions in the West Bank, which has already been gripped by a surge of violent attacks by heavily armed Jewish settlers on Palestinians and assaults by Hamas militants on Jews.

Israeli military and intelligence officials said they worried about a broader eruption of violence that could require a major response by a military already heavily deployed in the Gaza operation and in guarding against a potential attack in Israel’s north by the Lebanese-based Hezbollah."
376,376,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/world/middleeast/iran-saudi-arabia-gaza-cease-fire.html,"The leaders of Iran and Saudi Arabia, regional rivals who restored diplomatic ties this year, met in Riyadh on Saturday at a summit where they called for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and unconditional delivery of humanitarian aid to the enclave, which Israeli forces have besieged since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks.

The two Islamic countries, who support opposing factions in proxy conflicts across the region, first announced their diplomatic breakthrough in March, after years of hostility, in a deal brokered by China. But it was unclear whether the shift would lead to a lasting détente between Saudi Arabia’s Sunni monarchy and Iran’s Shiite government.

Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, however, appears to have hastened the warming of ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran, just as delicate diplomacy had been inching Saudi Arabia and Israel toward possible normalization of relations. Iran, which Israel considers its most dangerous foe, is a powerful patron of Hamas.

President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran, whose visit to Saudi Arabia was the first by an Iranian president to the kingdom in more than a decade, was greeted at the summit venue by Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The Iranian president draped on his shoulder a kaffiyeh, the black and white square checkered scarf that has become a badge of Palestinian identity.

The two leaders had spoken by phone for the first time just a few days after Oct. 7. Iran said in March that Mr. Raisi had received an invitation to visit the kingdom shortly after the two countries announced resumed relations.

The war was set off after the Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel by Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that controls Gaza, in which roughly 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.

Since then, Israel has bombarded Gaza with thousands of airstrikes, laid siege to the territory by cutting off water, food, fuel and other basic necessities, and launched a ground invasion with the stated intention of destroying Hamas, which Israel and many other countries regard as a terrorist organization."
378,378,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/opinion/biden-israel-gaza.html,"With the Middle East spiraling in the wrong direction, with too many fresh graves in Israel and Palestine alike, with children maimed and killed in Gaza in staggering numbers, with anger and bigotry spinning away to poison hearts around the world, the last, best hope may be President Biden.

It may not be possible to end the Gaza war this year, establish a post-Hamas peace in Gaza and restart a process to give Palestinians the state they deserve. But if there is a path, it’s difficult to see who could blaze it other than Biden.

Biden may be the single most popular person in Israel today, and the United States has leverage as Israel’s most important ally and diplomatic protector. Biden’s forceful backing of Israel after the Hamas terror attack won him enormous gratitude from a people not much used to such unequivocal support. And now that he has accumulated this political capital, he should use it — albeit for a series of risky initiatives that don’t have much chance of success.

To his credit, Biden has tried to nudge Israel in this direction, as has Secretary of State Antony Blinken. They’ve been rebuffed. But too many lives are at stake in Israel and Palestine alike to accept the snub; they must push harder.

The first step Biden took was essential, moving two aircraft carrier groups to the region to deter Hezbollah and Iran from expanding the war. That is working, so far.

The debate in America has often focused on a cease-fire, but that seems to me the wrong question. I’m fine with Israel taking out Hamas’s military leaders or destroying tunnels in a surgical way, but not with it leveling large sections of Gaza. It’s true, as Israeli officials note, that Hamas hides behind civilians — but Israel has a responsibility to value Palestinian lives even if Hamas doesn’t.

For now, Israel is turning entire neighborhoods in Gaza to rubble. About 100 United Nations employees have been killed in Gaza along with more than 30 journalists — and more than 4,300 children, by the count of the Gaza Health Ministry, which is under the Hamas government but whose numbers have been regarded as generally reliable by the State Department and humanitarian agencies. The United Nations says that 1,350 children are missing and may be buried in the debris.

Israel of course has a right to defend itself and to fight Hamas. But war is not a binary choice. At one end of the continuum is complete disregard for civilians (reflected in the suggestion by a member of Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet, subsequently reprimanded, that nuclear weapons may be used in Gaza), and at the other is an intervention that is entirely surgical but perhaps less effective. Those are the trade-offs.

The Biden administration has already encouraged Israel to ratchet its assault on Gaza several notches toward the surgical end, by using smaller bombs and allowing humanitarian pauses. Biden should press harder. I’m skeptical that the Israeli Army can actually eradicate extremist forces from Gaza, so it seems to me that what’s unfolding there now — with American complicity as we supply Israel with bombs and artillery shells — is neither militarily promising nor morally sustainable.

What will historians say about us when they describe Gazan children screaming during surgeries because their neighborhoods were bombed flat and hospitals ran out of anesthetic?

Biden might give Netanyahu a copy of the new book “Conflict,” co-written by General David Petraeus, which includes a Petraeus memo from 2008 about Iraq with the principle “We cannot kill our way out of this endeavor.”

Looking ahead, the next initiative must be a major push by Biden for an Israeli-Palestinian peace. A peace process is not possible now, even if the war weren’t underway, because both sides lack credible leaders to get there — but perhaps it’s feasible to create conditions that will encourage the emergence of decent leaders after the war is over.

For starters, it’s imperative that Israel freeze settlements and rein in violent settlers, for they are a cancer on the region. To his credit, Biden has condemned “extremist settlers” and said that their attacks on Palestinians must “stop, now.” But he isn’t getting through to Netanyahu, who seems to believe that Biden may fume but ultimately will bow to his intransigence.

Maybe there is nothing more that Biden can do, particularly at a time when Israel feels so shattered and threatened, to persuade Netanyahu to rein in settlers and reduce civilian deaths in Gaza. But it’s worth trying, which means applying firm pressure and sending signals such as reopening the American consulate in Jerusalem, which traditionally dealt with Palestinian issues, and reinstating the State Department legal opinion that settlements violate international law. The United States could also abstain at the United Nations Security Council on a resolution calling for humanitarian pauses, instead of vetoing it as happened last time.

Israel will most likely have a new leader after the war; I’m hoping that person will recognize that the way to keep Israelis safe is a peace deal with Palestinians.

On the Palestinian side, one possibility is for Hamas to exchange hostages for Israeli prisoners, leading to freedom for Marwan Barghouti. He is a charismatic figure who has been called Palestine’s Mandela for his advocacy in recent years of unarmed resistance and calls for Jewish and Palestinian states to exist in peace side by side. But he is also called a terrorist, for earlier he advocated violence, and he is now serving several life sentences in Israel for murder. However one views Barghouti, polls suggest that he is the most popular Palestinian leader in both Gaza and the West Bank, and he just might be the person best able to unite Palestinians and negotiate seriously for a long-term peace.

All of this is extremely iffy and politically risky. But the present course is even riskier and morally suspect.

Children in Gaza are dying at the rate of about one every 10 minutes, so I ask again a question I posed in a column as the war started: “How many dead Gazan children are too many?”

People will search their consciences and answer that question differently. But Biden’s answer will matter most. He just might have the capacity — by saying “Enough” — to help end this war and construct a durable peace on the ashes left behind."
379,379,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/opinion/west-bank-settler-violence.html,"The Biden administration has made clear it is aware of the tensions. “I continue to be alarmed about extremist settler attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank; pouring gasoline on fire is what it’s like,” President Biden recently said. “It has to stop now.” The administration also took the unusual step of seeking, and getting, assurances from Israel that none of the thousands of American assault weapons sought by Israel would go to civilians in the West Bank settlements.

Mr. Netanyahu, however, has shown little interest in restraining his allies. Though he formed a special war cabinet with opposition leaders to manage the conduct of the campaign against Hamas, his original coalition government remains intact, including the religious-nationalist extremists Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, the minister of national security, both unequivocal champions of settling Jews in the West Bank, which they refer to as the biblical Judea and Samaria. Before the Hamas raid, the far-right government was pushing for “judicial reform” that drew broad and sustained opposition in Israel as an attempt to free the government of judicial restraints on its actions in occupied territory.

Despite the national preoccupation with Gaza over the past month — or perhaps because of it — the zealots have kept at it. Mr. Smotrich has called for widening Palestinian no-go areas around Israeli settlements, including a ban on Palestinians harvesting olives near the settlements. Mr. Ben-Gvir has dismissed concerns raised by Israeli intelligence agencies about settler violence, referring to it as nothing more than “graffiti” by Israeli youths on Palestinian property and reportedly asking why there was so much attention given to it.

It’s hardly graffiti. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 150 Palestinians, including 44 children, have been killed by Israeli forces and eight others by Israeli settlers since Oct. 7, and at least 111 Palestinian households comprising 905 people were displaced. In that time, three Israeli soldiers were killed in attacks by Palestinians. That is an increase from an already high average of three incidents against Palestinians a day so far this year to an average of seven a day.

The figures don’t give the full story of the ways in which Palestinians are terrorized: the uprooting of hundreds of their olive trees, the vandalizing of property, the beatings and shootings, and the roads and outposts the settlers and sometimes the army have built to connect settlements and outposts. In an incident reported by The Times last week, a Palestinian vendor and his family were picking olives when four armed Jewish settlers showed up and began yelling. The Palestinians fled, but the vendor, Bilal Mohammad Saleh, turned back to grab his phone. Mr. Saleh was shot dead, the seventh Palestinian to be killed by settlers since Oct. 7."
380,380,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-oct-7-attack-shelter.html,"Nearly 30 young people took refuge inside a grimy bunker on the morning of Oct. 7, hoping the reinforced-concrete shelter near the border with Gaza would fulfill its promise of protection.

But just after 7:40 a.m., when a group of Hamas assailants, armed with assault rifles and grenades, attacked the shelter near Kibbutz Re’im in southern Israel, the very characteristics that made the tiny fortress a refuge from incoming rockets turned it into a deathtrap for those inside.

In less than an hour, after a desperate defense that included throwing live grenades back at their attackers, more than a dozen of the shelter’s occupants had been killed, their bodies blown apart and riddled with bullets. Others, dazed and injured, were taken to Gaza as hostages.

The slaughter that took place inside has been pieced together here from interviews with survivors and texts from the victims, as well as authenticated cellphone photographs, videos and dashcam footage from the scene.

In one of the less documented chapters of the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, Hamas assailants, using virtually identical methods, attacked multiple shelters in which their victims had sought safety, shattering a symbol of the nation’s sense of security.

As roughly 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel, according to Israeli officials, and as about 240 others were abducted to Gaza, the brutality of the day’s attacks prompted Israel to declare a war on Hamas-controlled Gaza aimed at dismantling the group’s military abilities and ending its rule there. Health officials in Gaza say Israeli strikes have killed more than 11,000 people in the Palestinian enclave.

There is no official list of who was in the bunker near Re’im, one of hundreds of shelters that dot the roads of southern Israel. As hundreds of young people fled a nearby music festival, Tribe of Nova, that morning, small groups of friends each made the same decision. Seeing a shelter, its exterior painted with a colorful mural of a bird, they pulled their cars off the road and sought safety inside.

“We thought it was a safe place where we would wait awhile, then go home,” said Ziv Abud, 26, a saleswoman from Tel Aviv and one of the bunker’s few survivors. She had arrived at the festival around 4:30 a.m. with her boyfriend, her nephew and his girlfriend. Of the four, she was the only one to make it home."
381,381,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/world/middleeast/gaza-city-survival-fear.html,"For years, Mohammad Matar worked on constructing pipelines that moved water across the Gaza Strip — from northern Beit Lahia to southern Rafah. Now, he can barely get access to water himself.

Mr. Matar, a 35-year-old civil engineer, was reached by phone on Thursday evening in Gaza City, where he and his family have remained even as Israeli ground forces continue their relentless assault on Hamas.

In a city increasingly cut off from the rest of the world, Mr. Matar described days full of desperation and fear.

“I have watched a lot of horror movies, but I have never watched a horror movie like this one,” he said. “I am certain that what you see on the TV is not even 5 percent of what we are experiencing.”

Mr. Matar says that his family, like many in Gaza, is coping with food shortages. They have not had vegetables for nearly eight days, and he can’t remember the last time he ate chicken or meat. On most days, his family cooks instant noodles over charcoal, and while one box typically lasts a week, he is rationing so that each will last up to to 20 days.

“We are trying to conserve what we have until the situation changes — until this sad story is over,” Mr. Matar said.

The Israeli military has for weeks ordered residents of northern Gaza to leave for their protection, and warned that those who do not “may be considered a member of a terrorist organization.” In just the past week, as Israel has begun to enact daily combat pauses, an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 residents have fled south by foot, according to UNRWA, the U.N. agency that helps Palestinians.

Videos posted to social media by the Israel Defense Forces show families, some with their hands held up, down a main thoroughfare as Israeli soldiers monitor them behind military vehicles.

But after fleeing, they remain vulnerable, according to Juliette Touma, UNRWA’s director of communications. “This assumption that the south is safe is wrong,” she said in an interview, calling Israel’s order “forced displacement” that had sent droves of people walking south, “dehydrated, exhausted and fearful.”

“There is nowhere that is safe in Gaza,” Ms. Touma said.

As a result of limited communication and disruptions in aid supply, Ms. Touma said it was impossible to estimate how many people remained in Gaza City, adding that the north had become “the most dangerous area on Earth.”

As Israeli troops engage in street battles with Hamas and their relentless attacks engulf more of the city, Mr. Matar and his family have remained.

“This is our fate,” he said. “But we hope God will change the situation.”

For 10 years, Mr. Matar worked on water infrastructure projects for Saqqa and Khoudary Contracting, a Palestinian construction company based in the West Bank. He said his projects, including building water tanks and the distribution systems attached to them, were now destroyed and estimates that it would take months to a year to restore water to the Gaza Strip when the fighting ends.

As for now, he said, “You are privileged if you can find water to wash your hands or face.”

On Friday, UNRWA’s commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini, said that Israel’s siege of Gaza — which has limited access to food, water, medicine and fuel for the enclave’s two million residents — had the potential to produce a “much larger catastrophe,” including starvation.

There is no fuel to operate Gaza’s underground pumps. And because there are also no bottles of water to be found in the stores, Mr. Matar has been relying on his neighbors’ reserves.

“I just take a bunch of buckets and have them fill those with water for me,” he said. “We don’t even know if this water is healthy or not.”

Beyond the fear of thirst and hunger, Mr. Matar is most worried for the physical safety of his wife and two daughters, ages 3 and 8, who cling to his side amid the stream of explosions. He tries to distract them with games and laughter, if only temporarily.

“When she hears the missiles in her sleep, my 3-year-old jumps,” Mr. Matar said. “She asked me, ‘Why is this happening?’ But what can I say?”

Mr. Matar is having a hard time falling asleep himself these days, unsure whether he will wake up the next morning.

“I sit and pray with my wife all the time,” he said. “What’s happening is beyond abnormal.” He added: “I want this article to reach people who have the power to stop this war.”

The large march in support of the Palestinian cause coincided with Armistice Day, when Britain commemorates those who fought in World War I and subsequent conflicts, and followed days of debate about whether the protest should be allowed to go ahead.

A spokesperson for London’s Metropolitan Police Service said by phone on Saturday afternoon that about 300,000 people had attended the march, making it one of the largest protests in Britain in recent years.

The precarity of the hospitals was made clear early on Friday when projectiles struck inside the Al Shifa complex, Gaza’s largest hospital, and a video appeared to show people being turned back by gunfire as they tried to evacuate another hospital.

Israeli tanks and troops have surrounded several hospitals in Gaza, hospital administrators and the Gazan Health Ministry said on Friday. A spokesman for the Israeli military said of the hospitals, “we’re slowly closing in on them” and urged people to leave them.

Israel has long maintained that Hamas uses the hospitals as shields, operating from within them, while thousands of Palestinian civilians have taken refuge on their grounds.

The chief of Al Shifa Hospital said it was struck four times on Friday, killing seven people, with several others wounded. The sources of the strikes and the extent of the damage were not immediately known.

In what appeared to be his strongest comments to date on the dire state of Gazan civilians, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Friday that “far too many Palestinians have been killed.” His remarks edged as close as he has come so far to criticizing Israel’s conduct of the five-week-old war.

“Much more needs to be done to protect civilians and to make sure that humanitarian assistance reaches them,” Mr. Blinken told reporters in New Delhi after a diplomatic tour through Middle Eastern and Asian nations. “Far too many have suffered these past weeks. And we want to do everything possible to prevent harm to them and to maximize the assistance that gets to them.”"

And just before he left for New York, Russian rockets fell on Odesa. “I have 3,000 Jews who are looking to me and at everything their rabbi is doing,” he said. “For them I have to be strong.”

In an apology posted on the museum’s website, Elizabeth Barker, the museum’s executive director, acknowledged that the museum had not initially been forthcoming about its decision to delay the exhibition, “Treasured Ornament: 10 Centuries of Islamic Art,” and apologized for causing offense when she later tried to explain the decision.

“There are no excuses for what I said, regardless of my intentions,” Ms. Barker said in the statement. “My words gave the offensive and utterly wrong impression that I equated Islam with terrorism and that I saw Jews and Muslims — communities with millennia of peaceful interconnection — as fundamentally opposed.”

The museum initially made no announcement about its decision not to open the show, saying on its website only that the delay was due to “a scheduling conflict.” Ms. Barker later told The Tribune-Review that it was a show “that a forgiving person would call insensitive, but for many people, especially in our community, would be traumatic.” Her comments were denounced by local Muslim and Jewish groups, who said that they perpetuated harmful stereotypes linking Islamic art to terrorism or antisemitism.

“My failure to tell it straight from the beginning undermined trust in our organization and had the effect of retraumatizing people,” Barker wrote in the letter. “Today, I want to make public my and the Frick’s commitment to hold ourselves accountable to repair the relationships we damaged and earn back the trust we have lost.”

The exhibition was set to feature paintings, metalwork and glassware made by artists of different faiths working in the Islamic world, according to scholars who studied the included artifacts.

In the aftermath of the controversy over the postponement, leaders from the Frick Pittsburgh met with different cultural groups, including the city’s chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

Christine Mohamed, the chapter’s executive director, said that the group appreciated the sincerity of the Frick Pittsburgh’s apology and their commitment to accountability.

“We believe in the power of open dialogue to bridge gaps and build stronger community bonds,” she said in a statement.

The museum has rescheduled the exhibition to open in August 2024. The postponed exhibition was organized by the nonprofit International Arts and Artists, which created it on behalf of the Huntington Museum of Art in West Virginia.

In her apology, Barker said that she had been humbled by speaking with people about the controversy, “including leaders in our region’s Muslim community, who have reframed this moment as an opportunity for us to learn and grow.”"
387,387,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/world/middleeast/blinken-palestinians-israel-war.html,"Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Friday that “far too many Palestinians have been killed” in Gaza, in the latest indication that the Biden administration is growing increasingly concerned about the civilian death toll under Israel’s bombardment and ground invasion.

“Much more needs to be done to protect civilians and to make sure that humanitarian assistance reaches them,” Mr. Blinken told reporters in New Delhi after a diplomatic tour through Middle Eastern and Asian nations. “Far too many Palestinians have been killed. Far too many have suffered these past weeks. And we want to do everything possible to prevent harm to them and to maximize the assistance that gets to them.”

He added that United States officials would continue to discuss “concrete steps” with Israel to recover at least 240 hostages held by Palestinian militants and get humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, which Hamas controls.

Mr. Blinken’s remarks also suggested that the Biden administration is stepping up pressure on Israel to do more to limit the harm to civilians in its campaign against Hamas, as outrage grows from the United Nations and many countries over the mounting toll in Gaza. The United States has staunchly supported Israel since Hamas attacked it on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,000 people, according to Israeli officials, but it has also urged Israeli leaders to exercise restraint in their campaign.

President Biden cast doubt last month on the casualty figures released by the Gazan health ministry, which said this week that more than 10,000 people had been killed. But U.S. officials have acknowledged in recent days that thousands of civilians have been killed since Israel began its retaliatory campaign for the Hamas attack.

Asked about Palestinian civilians, American officials have emphasized that they do not have the ability to verify any toll, and said that Hamas uses civilians as human shields.

They have, though, made broad assessments. On Tuesday, the U.S. national security spokesman, John Kirby, told reporters, “There have been many thousands killed, and each one is a tragedy.” On Wednesday, Barbara Leaf, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, told a House committee that U.S. officials thought the casualty numbers overall were “very high, frankly, and it could be that they’re even higher than are being cited.”

And the Biden administration has been pushing Israel to commit to humanitarian pauses so that more Palestinian civilians could flee to southern Gaza from the north, where Israel has concentrated its ground operation against Hamas. After days of pressure from U.S. officials, Israel agreed to daily four-hour pauses in some areas of northern Gaza, the White House announced on Thursday.

Mr. Kirby said the pauses would facilitate the delivery of humanitarian supplies and possibly help the release of some of the hostages held by Hamas.

American officials have also spoken about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, echoing the warnings of United Nations officials and aid workers that more than a million people have been displaced from their homes. The United Nations has called for a cease-fire, which U.S. and Israeli officials have resisted, arguing that it would give Hamas time to regroup.

The U.N. aid office said on Friday that it could no longer deliver aid to several hundred thousand Palestinians in northern Gaza, where Israel has warned people to flee and where its troops are conducting a ground operation.

“If there is a hell on earth, it’s northern Gaza,” the aid office’s spokesman, Jens Laerke, told reporters on Friday.

He said the Rafah gate, at Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, had been designed as a pedestrian crossing point and was ill-suited for large aid convoys. Only a few convoys have been able to cross the border so far, and U.N. and American officials have said that vastly more is needed to help civilians in Gaza, who face dwindling supplies of food, clean water and medicine.

The neighborhood includes a substantial Jewish population. The vandalism, which the police are investigating as a hate crime, was first reported by The Daily News.

The New York Police Department said the incident occurred on Oct. 9, two days after Hamas fighters in Israel killed more than 1,000 people and captured more than 200.

There has been a rise in antisemitic and other bias crimes since the start of the war, placing both Jewish and Muslim New Yorkers on edge. Total hate crimes in New York City in October were more than double the levels for the previous October, and anti-Jewish incidents more than tripled.

Earlier this week, New York lawmakers introduced a bill expanding the range of offenses that can be prosecuted as hate crimes and closing loopholes in existing laws.

The Gaza Strip has all the harrowing pitfalls soldiers have learned to expect from urban warfare: high-rise ambushes, truncated lines of sight and, everywhere, vulnerable civilians with nowhere to hide.

But as Israeli ground forces inch their way forward in Gaza, the bigger danger may prove to be underfoot.

The Hamas militants who launched a bloody attack on Israel last month have built a maze of hidden tunnels some believe extend across most if not all of Gaza, the territory they control.

And they are not mere tunnels.

Snaking beneath dense residential areas, the passageways allow fighters to move around free from the eye of the enemy. There are also bunkers for stockpiling weapons, food and water, and even command centers and tunnels wide enough for vehicles, researchers believe.

Ordinary-looking doors and hatches serve as disguised access points, letting Hamas fighters dart out on missions and then slip back out of sight.

No outsider has an exact map of the network, and few Israelis have seen it firsthand.

But photos and video and reports from people who have been in the tunnels suggest the basic outlines of the system and how it is used. The source material includes photographs taken inside the passageways by journalists, accounts from researchers who study the tunnels, and details of the network that emerged from Israeli forces when they invaded Gaza in 2014.

Dismantling the tunnels is a key part of Israel’s goal of wiping out Hamas’s leadership in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack.

Israel has used the existence of the tunnels as justification for bombing civilian areas, including after a large Israeli airstrike hit a densely populated area in the Jabaliya neighborhood. Hamas has denied its tunnels were under some of the specific sites struck by Israel, and it is often impossible to verify Israel’s claims.

To destroy tunnels on the ground, Israeli troops in Gaza will need to find entrances that are often hidden in the basements of civilian buildings, leading into concrete-lined tunnels, imagery suggests. They are typically just six and a half feet tall and three feet wide, experts said, forcing fighters to move through them single file.

One 85-year-old Israeli woman who was held hostage for 17 days in the tunnels after being kidnapped on Oct. 7 described being marched through a “spider web” of wet and humid tunnels. She eventually reached a large hall where two dozen other hostages were being held, she said.

There are still believed to be more than 200 Israeli hostages being held by Hamas, and many are likely in the very tunnels Israel aims to destroy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that bringing them home is one of the two main aims of the invasion, the other being to “destroy Hamas.”

The tunnels used for hiding Hamas equipment and fighters are not the only hidden passageways in Gaza.

After Hamas came to power in 2007, and Israel tightened its blockade of the territory, an extensive network of smuggling tunnels grew under the border between Gaza and Egypt. These tunnels are used to circumvent the blockade and allow the import of a wide variety of goods, from weapons and electronic equipment to construction materials and fuel.

The Egyptian authorities have made extensive efforts to destroy these smuggling routes, including pumping seawater to flood the network and collapse many of the tunnels. But some smuggling tunnels are still believed to be in operation.

Smuggling tunnels These tunnels have been documented in the Rafah area, where they are used to bring all types of goods and products into Gaza from Egypt.

Although the Israeli military far surpasses Hamas’s in both size and equipment, fighting an enemy with its own network of tunnels is a high-risk undertaking.

John W. Spencer, who studies urban warfare at the U.S. Military Academy’s Modern War Institute, describes it as more like “fighting under the sea than it is on the surface or inside of a building.”

“Nothing that you use on the surface works,” he said recently on the Modern Warfare Project podcast. “You have to have specialized equipment to breathe, to see, to navigate, to communicate and to deploy lethal means, especially shooting.”

One of the main dangers of going into the tunnels is that Hamas has booby-trapped the entrances with explosives, experts say.

“The moment they realize the Israelis have entered the tunnels, they will just press the button and the entire thing could collapse on the Israelis,” said Ahron Bregman, a senior teaching fellow at King’s College London who specializes in the Arab-Israeli conflict.

The challenge of disabling tunnels The danger does not end after a tunnel is detected. Hidden entrances Booby traps Many entrances are hidden in buildings’ basements, but even the ones outside are very difficult to spot. The only way to find them is to send soldiers to scour areas on foot. The entrances are often equipped with remotely triggered bombs or explosives rigged with tripwires. Booby trap Tunnel entry Tunnel access Ambushes Alternate entrances The multiple entrances and branching pathways allow Hamas fighters to lie in wait, and then launch surprise attacks on enemy forces. If Israeli forces succeed in knocking a tunnel out of commission with airstrikes or ground-based explosives, Hamas can quickly excavate other entrances, ensuring that the passageway remains operational.

Israeli forces will probably not be able to destroy the entire tunnel network.

“It is just too big, and there’s no point in dismantling all of it,” said Dr. Bregman. Instead, they will focus on blocking the entrances to the tunnels, likely by calling in airstrikes, or having engineers destroy them with explosives.

They are also unlikely to take their fight underground — unless they believe they have no other choice.

Entering the tunnels would strip Israeli forces of their advantages, Dr. Bregman said. At the moment, the Israelis are making headway with a mass of troops, tanks and helicopters.

But are Israel’s actions — as the nation’s opponents argue — verging on ethnic cleansing or, most explosively, genocide?

As a historian of genocide, I believe that there is no proof that genocide is currently taking place in Gaza, although it is very likely that war crimes, and even crimes against humanity, are happening. That means two important things: First, we need to define what it is that we are seeing, and second, we have the chance to stop the situation before it gets worse. We know from history that it is crucial to warn of the potential for genocide before it occurs, rather than belatedly condemn it after it has taken place. I think we still have that time.

It is clear that the daily violence being unleashed on Gaza is both unbearable and untenable. Since the Oct. 7 massacre by Hamas — itself a war crime and a crime against humanity — Israel’s military air and ground assault on Gaza has killed more than 10,500 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, a number that includes thousands of children. That’s well over five times as many people as the more than 1,400 people in Israel murdered by Hamas. In justifying the assault, Israeli leaders and generals have made terrifying pronouncements that indicate a genocidal intent.

Still, the collective horror of what we are watching does not mean that a genocide, according to the international legal definition of the term, is already underway. Because genocide, sometimes called “the crime of all crimes,” is perceived by many to be the most extreme of all crimes, there is often an impulse to describe any instance of mass murder and massacre as genocide. But this urge to label all atrocious events as genocide tends to obfuscate reality rather than explain it.

International humanitarian law identifies several grave crimes in armed conflict. War crimes are defined in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and subsequent protocols as serious violations of the laws and customs of war in international armed conflict against both combatants and civilians. The Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court, defines crimes against humanity as extermination of, or other mass crimes against, any civilian population. The crime of genocide was defined in 1948 by the United Nations as “the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.”

So in order to prove that genocide is taking place, we need to show both that there is the intent to destroy and that destructive action is taking place against a particular group. Genocide as a legal concept differs from ethnic cleansing in that the latter, which has not been recognized as its own crime under international law, aims to remove a population from a territory, often violently, whereas genocide aims at destroying that population wherever it is. In reality, any of these situations — and especially ethnic cleansing — may escalate into genocide, as happened in the Holocaust, which began with an intention to remove the Jews from German-controlled territories and transformed into the intention of their physical extermination."

On a warm Friday afternoon in October, Luis Ferré-Sadurní, who covers New York State politics for The New York Times, scanned the faces of a crowd at a beachfront resort in Puerto Rico. He had hoped to spot Robert Menendez, the New Jersey senator who had been indicted on federal bribery charges — and who was, nevertheless, holding his annual fund-raiser at the hotel.

Donors at the fund-raiser were scarce, Mr. Ferré-Sadurní later reported in an article. Mr. Menendez’s political implosion was evident from the empty seats and leftover shrimp cocktail. The senator never showed up.

Three days later, while on his flight home to New York, Mr. Ferré-Sadurní learned that Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York was planning to visit Israel on a “solidarity mission.” The impromptu trip would begin just over a week after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. Mr. Ferré-Sadurní managed to join Ms. Hochul on her flight to Tel Aviv less than 24 hours later.

It was an atypical week for Mr. Ferré-Sadurní; travel for him normally involves Amtrak rides between New York City and Albany. “If I travel, it’s usually to cover elections elsewhere in the state or to follow the governor when they travel out of the state,” he said in a recent conversation. “This was the governor’s first trip abroad after being elected last year. And it was to a place that matters to a large constituency of New Yorkers.”

Here, Mr. Ferré-Sadurní discusses his time reporting from two very different settings — a beachfront resort and a war zone — and how he decompressed afterward. This interview has been edited and condensed.

How did the Puerto Rico trip materialize?

In September, I was asked to help cover the fallout from the corruption scandal involving Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey. I put aside my Albany reporting duties to work with my Metro colleagues Tracey Tully and Nicholas Fandos. We had heard that Mr. Menendez was still planning to go through with his annual fund-raiser, despite all the political turmoil he was in and the calls for his resignation. I’m from Puerto Rico, so we decided that it would make sense for me to fly there, report on the fund-raiser and see who, if anyone, would show up.

How did you get access to the fund-raiser?

I talked to some local connections on the island to gain access to the members-only resort in Dorado Beach, where the fund-raiser was being held. Once I was there, I blended in as a hotel guest, sometimes in swimming trunks, and roamed the beach and hotel areas hoping to spot the senator. I also obtained an internal email with a schedule of the events for the weekend, so I had some visibility into the inner workings of the fund-raiser and how it was collapsing in real time.

I tried to be discreet. During the opening reception, I picked a spot by a palm tree near the beach a few yards away from the reception, which overlooked the beach. I sat there for about three hours. As guests came in and out, I tried to identify who they were. Only about a dozen people showed up.

When did you learn of Governor Hochul’s plans to visit Israel?

While I was flying back to New York, I got an email from the governor’s team indicating that she was flying to Israel. I asked the press secretary if there was any space for a reporter on the trip, even though it was happening in the next 24 hours.

To my surprise, he said they could try to make space for a reporter. I jumped at the opportunity. I thought it would be an especially important moment for The Times to follow the governor during one of the most contentious moments in the Middle East and see how she navigated that situation. By the time I landed in New York, I was confirmed.

Were you given any kind of parameters about your interactions with Governor Hochul?

I was not given any guidelines. I got to hang out with the governor at a terminal at Kennedy Airport before our flight. I got to interview her on the record without any restrictions on what I could ask. Throughout the trip, I was able to roam freely and ask questions and get her perspective on what she was seeing and observing, along with a photographer, Baz Ratner.

Her father died of a brain hemorrhage while she was abroad. Did she open up about that news?

She was very upfront and candid with me about the delicate condition her father was in, which was surprising. When we landed in Tel Aviv, I asked her how her flight had gone, and she said, Well, I found out my father suffered a brain hemorrhage and is on a ventilator and he’s not going to make it. I think I was one of the first people she told.

I offered my condolences, and I obviously had my journalistic hat on. I was very aware that she was going to meet with grieving families while also going through a very human moment herself. The following day I learned that her father had passed away overnight. When I saw her for the first time that day at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, she was huddled with her staff, who were offering their condolences.

What was your experience like in Israel?

We visited a couple of hotels that housed displaced families from communities along the Gaza border that were attacked. We got to talk to families who had been directly affected by the attacks and were still reeling from that trauma. We visited the Western Wall, one of the holiest Jewish sites, and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, one of the holiest Christian sites. The governor is Catholic and insisted on going to the church, even though it was not on the schedule.

The most revealing part of the trip was a visit south to a kibbutz called Kfar Azza, which is about a mile and a half from the Gaza border. We traveled in armored vehicles and were outfitted in green body vests and bulletproof helmets; we could see the smoke from explosions on the horizon from where Israeli airstrikes were hitting Gaza. Once we got to the kibbutz, we were given a tour by Israeli military officials. It was a very eerie, dreadful sight. The trip was filled with a lot of new sensory experiences for me, which are common for some of my colleagues who report from the front lines of wars.

How did you decompress after your trip?

I spent about 30 hours in Israel. I realized afterward that I had only slept about three hours during the trip. So the first thing I did when I got back to my apartment in Brooklyn was go to sleep for a very long time. It hit me that I was deeply shaken by what I saw when I went to my regular bagel place for breakfast.

I was sitting there, watching people go about their day when, 12 hours earlier, I had been on the edge of a war zone. It felt incredibly jarring and uncomfortable in many ways because of how quickly it happened. I processed it by talking about it with my dad, who is also a journalist. I returned to my job with an even greater appreciation for the work that we do."
393,393,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/world/asia/israel-gaza-people-leave.html,"After weeks of waiting, hundreds of people were allowed to leave the besieged Gaza Strip on Wednesday, the first of thousands of foreigners, aid workers and critically wounded patients who were expected to exit in the coming days, as two million increasingly desperate people remained behind.

By Wednesday night, buses had ferried 361 foreign nationals over the border to Egypt, and ambulances had carried 45 severely injured Palestinians, along with some of their family members, to Egyptian hospitals, Al Qahera, an Egyptian state-owned television channel, reported. They left behind the destruction and the most immediate suffering wrought by the war between Israel and Hamas, the group that controls Gaza.

While a few U.S. citizens were among the aid workers let out of Gaza, in general, diplomats said that Americans — the State Department has estimated there are 500 to 600 — would not begin to leave until Thursday, for reasons that were not made clear.

Among those who left Wednesday was Lama Eldin, 30, who was born in Bulgaria, making her the only member of her Palestinian family able to leave. Fighting back tears, her mother, Nadia Salah, described saying goodbye at the border. Her husband and two other children also had to stay back.

“It’s very difficult, but she should go,” Nadia Salah said. “To be safe.”"
395,395,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/nyregion/protests-israel-hamas-palestinians-nyc.html,"Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war shut down traffic in Midtown Manhattan on Thursday night, marking one of the largest actions in New York City in recent weeks.

Earlier in the day, dozens of students protested at schools around the city.

Pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian protests have become a daily occurrence on the city’s streets and campuses in the last month, as anger over the war rises and fears about antisemitic and anti-Muslim bias escalate. Other campus conflicts have broken out on social media, sometimes between students furious with the response of administrators and with each other.

The march in Midtown closed sections of Fifth Avenue before protesters turned onto 34th Street, snarling evening commute traffic. Participants waved Palestinian flags and chanted “Shut it down” and “Free Palestine” to a drumbeat as they passed under the Christmas lights already strung along Macy’s facade.

“I think there’s a real need for solidarity right now,” said Sam Cribben as she marched along West 34th Street toward Eighth Avenue with a group of friends. “Palestinian people can’t really use their voice that much right now, and it’s on us to use our voices because they’re being silenced.”"

The official congressional rebuke of Ms. Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, said the phrase was “widely recognized as a genocidal call to violence to destroy the state of Israel.” The top White House spokeswoman disavowed it from the West Wing, saying that it was “divisive” and that many considered it hurtful and antisemitic.

The phrase, which Ms. Tlaib has defended as “an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction or hate” has not only become a flashpoint for dispute in Washington; it has echoed across college campuses and in cities throughout the country in recent weeks as pro-Palestinian activists protest the heavy civilian toll of Israel’s war against Hamas. The slogan has prompted charges of antisemitism and fueled an increasingly bitter debate over the conflict, its root causes and how it should be waged — and what position the United States should be taking as it rages on.

The decades-old phrase has a complicated back story that has led to radically different interpretations by Israelis and Palestinians, and by Americans who support them."

In a nation used to painful soul-searching about its Nazi past, the date marks the moment when Hitler and the National Socialists accelerated the anti-Jewish campaign that would become the Holocaust, orchestrating a nationwide pogrom that included the torching of synagogues and Jewish-owned stores and businesses.

Each year the anniversary is marked by somber vows of “never again” to allow such hatred and violence to be replicated.

On the night of Nov. 9, 1938, uniformed Nazi troops belonging to the S.A. and S.S. led regular Germans in a coordinated attack on Jewish temples, shops, and social gathering places — the fiercest attack on Jewish life since the Nazis took power in 1933. In the rampage of violence, Nazis ransacked and set fire to synagogues, many of which were never rebuilt."
399,399,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/opinion/israel-gaza-hamas.html,"Step back far enough, and you can see exactly what is driving so much geopolitics today: Ukraine is trying to join the West. Israel is trying to join a new Middle East. And Russia and Iran have teamed up to try to block both.

Unfortunately, the new G.O.P. House speaker, Mike Johnson, is either too inexperienced or too ideological (or both) to see this (or to care). He is pushing a budget that would help Israel better defend itself but would deprive Ukraine of essential U.S. economic and military assistance to beat back Russia’s onslaught.

And he’s conditioned even the $14.3 billion the administration wants to send to Israel on President Biden agreeing to strip the same amount from funds added for the Internal Revenue Service so it could better collect taxes from cheaters. (Attention, Israel lobby: Do not go along with that game. Next time, aid for Israel will be tied to extreme G.O.P. positions on abortion or guns.)

Thank goodness Johnson was not the speaker during World War II; he and his myopic members might have pressed to fund the war against the Germans in Europe but not against the Japanese in the Pacific. Or they would have agreed to Lend-Lease assistance for the allies only if President Franklin Roosevelt would eliminate the I.R.S. altogether. More guns, more butter, no taxes and two fronts."
400,400,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/style/kaffiyeh-palestine-israel-hamas-war.html,"Around the neck, over the head, draped down the back, pinned into hair, wrapped around a face — there are many ways to style a kaffiyeh, the square checkered scarf traditionally worn in parts of the Middle East.

The black-and-white version in particular has become a badge of Palestinian identity, with many Palestinians wearing it at events like weddings and graduations. The kaffiyeh has also been adopted by Palestinians as a symbol of their aspiration and long struggle for independence, making it divisive to those who associate it with the fighting involved in that struggle.

Since the start of the Israel-Hamas War, as demonstrations have cropped up globally in support of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, some Palestinians have been encouraging non-Palestinians to embrace the kaffiyeh as a symbol of unity, and to wear it as a show of solidarity.

At a march for Gaza in Lower Manhattan on Oct. 26, kaffiyehs were worn by a diverse group carrying Palestinian flags. Three men, who were sandwiched between two halal carts, prayed on top of a kaffiyeh in lieu of a prayer mat.

Binh Ly, 33, who had a black-and-white kaffiyeh around his neck, said he hadn’t been sure if he could wear the scarf until he talked about it with a Palestinian friend. “She gave me permission,” said Mr. Ly, who is Vietnamese and lives in Queens. His parents, he added, fled to the United States because of the Vietnam War.

Ivanna Rodriguez-Rojas, a 24-year-old who lives in Manhattan, had a black-and-white kaffiyeh around her head at the protest. She said she also didn’t know that Palestinian people encouraged non-Palestinian people to wear the scarf until she saw a recent post on X, formerly Twitter, shared by Fatima Saleh, a 38-year-old Palestinian who lives in Edmonton, Canada.

“Yes anyone can wear it! Your solidarity means everything to us,” the post read."
401,401,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/world/middleeast/hamas-october-7-attack-israel-remains.html,"Moshe Ajami, a veteran Israeli archaeologist, has spent decades sifting through the country’s southern desert to excavate lost ruins that date back more than 2,000 years. But in the past couple of weeks, he has been focused on searching the ashes of homes burned down by Hamas terrorists during last month’s surprise attack, looking for the bones, blood and teeth of Israelis who remain missing.

“As archaeologists, we are trained to identify human remains that others may miss,” said Mr. Ajami, the deputy head of Israel’s Antiquities Authority, during an interview in his office in Jerusalem.

The soft-spoken Mr. Ajami is one of roughly 15 archaeologists, with experience in excavations ranging from ancient scrolls to buried tombs, who have mobilized to try to provide closure for Israelis still awaiting news of their loved ones. The team has recovered the remains of at least 60 people so far, he said, most of them in Be’eri, a village of 1,000 people that suffered devastating losses in the attack.

The Oct. 7 assault left approximately 1,400 dead, 240 abducted and scores missing in Israel. The country is still reeling, with thousands evacuated from their homes, and a lagging government response. Weeks after the disaster some bodies have yet to be identified and their families remain in the dark.

Israeli health officials accustomed to handling a few dozen cases per week have been overwhelmed by the influx of bodies, some of which, they say, were desecrated or burned. While the military is leading the identification efforts, a handful of organizations and independent initiatives — ranging from groups of bird watchers to K-9 units — are combing the affected area looking for traces of the missing."
402,402,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/world/middleeast/palestinian-authority-gaza.html,"Even if Israeli troops eradicate Hamas, the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority as the group’s successor in Gaza is far from assured. Hamas militants ousted it from power in the enclave in 2007, and in the years since, the Authority has languished in the West Bank, dogged by charges of corruption, weakness and a lack of accountability.

Mr. al-Sheikh personifies such problems. Despite being viewed as a potential successor to Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority’s 87-year-old president, he is not popular with the public in his job overseeing day-to-day relations between Palestinians and the Israeli military, which have become increasingly fractious since the war broke out.

In his interview with The Times, Mr. al-Sheikh acknowledged the combustible nature of the region after last month’s attacks and the Israeli military response, a war that has killed 10,000 Palestinians, according to the Gazan health authorities.

“Without a comprehensive political initiative from the U.S.,” he said, a postwar Gaza would be “a fertile soil for radicalism.”

For his part, Mr. Biden has publicly embraced a Palestinian state as a remedy for the crisis. “There has to be a vision of what comes next,” he said recently of the war between Israel and Hamas. “In our view, it has to be a two-state solution.”

But he has yet to lay out a road map for getting there and, until now, has done little to suggest that his administration will invest in such a project.

Mr. Biden did not follow through on a campaign pledge to reopen the Washington office of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which his predecessor, Donald J. Trump, ordered closed. He did not reopen the American consulate in Jerusalem, which served Palestinians and was also closed by Mr. Trump. And unlike several of Mr. Biden’s predecessors, he has not named a Middle East envoy.

Until the Hamas attacks, the Middle East peace process ranked comparatively low on the list of White House foreign-policy priorities, after geopolitical rivalries like China and Russia. But the explosion of war between Israel and Hamas has catapulted the issue back to the top of the list.

On his tour of the region in the past week, Mr. Blinken, who had flown from Israel to Jordan, doubled back to meet with Mr. Abbas and Mr. al-Sheikh. He praised the Palestinian Authority for trying to keep order in the West Bank, where violence has soared between Palestinians and extremist Israeli settlers, some of whom are armed and have attacked their neighbors.

On Wednesday, at a meeting of foreign ministers in Tokyo, Mr. Blinken described what he called “elements to get a sustained peace,” chiefly the unification of Gaza with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.

“These must include the Palestinian people’s voices and aspirations at the center of post-crisis governance in Gaza,” he said. “It must include Palestinian-led governance and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.”

But Israel may fall out with the United States on that approach. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested this week that his country would maintain a security role in Gaza even after the war ends, because “we’ve seen what happens when we don’t have it.”

Mr. al-Sheikh said he did not believe that any peace deal was possible with Mr. Netanyahu, or his government, which includes far-right and ultranationalist ministers who favor Israel’s annexation of the West Bank.

Mr. Netanyahu, he said, was seizing on the Hamas attacks to drive Palestinians out of Gaza, likening the situation to what the Palestinians call the “nakba,” or catastrophe, the mass displacement of Palestinians before and after Israel’s creation in 1948.

“The strategic goal of this war is to displace the Palestinian people,” he said. “They want to separate Gaza entirely from the West Bank.”

In today’s inflamed atmosphere, Mr. al-Sheikh said, the Palestinian Authority’s plea for calm is unpopular with its people, who are enraged by the deaths of thousands of Palestinian civilians in the Gaza war and yearn for vengeance.

“Palestinians do not accept this stance right now,” he said. “People may not understand my position today, but they will tomorrow.”

“I’m not Hamas,” Mr. al-Sheikh concluded. “I represent the Palestinian people.”"
403,403,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/business/energy-environment/oil-price-israel-gaza.html,"Intense fighting is underway in a region that holds much of the world’s petroleum resources. Yet, after a few days of anxiety following the bloody Oct. 7 raids by Hamas militants in Israel, energy markets have been slumping. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, is selling for about $80 a barrel, cheaper than when the fighting started.

Why aren’t prices higher? A main reason, analysts say, is that the fighting, no matter how vicious, has produced little disruption to petroleum supplies, leading traders to conclude that there is no immediate threat.

“While traders realize there is an increased risk, that hasn’t led to a lot of precautionary buying,” said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects, a London-based market research firm.

With respect to the Middle East, the markets are “effectively dismissing that anything could go wrong,” said Raad Alkadiri, managing director for energy and climate at Eurasia Group, a political risk firm.

Mr. Alkadiri said that traders are unlikely to bid up prices unless they see “actual barrels removed” from the market.

Waning Demand in Focus

The market appears to have blocked the war out, and has returned to a mood of pessimism about future demand for petroleum, dominated by economic concerns about China, the largest oil importer, and other large consumers. Saudi Arabia and other producers have been trying to support prices by reducing their oil output.

Forecasters are warning that 2024 could be a difficult year in the oil markets. The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted this week that gasoline consumption in the United States would decline next year because of more efficient vehicle engines, growing numbers of electric cars, and reduced commuting as more people work hybrid schedules.

The bearish sentiment drove down prices sharply before the Israel-Hamas conflict and it appears to be weighing on the market again, despite the risks of a broader war.

Robust oil production in the United States has also reassured markets, with supplies from the world’s largest producer recently setting a monthly record, at just over 13 million barrels a day. “Strong oil market fundamentals are prevailing over any fears at the moment,” said Jim Burkhard, vice president and head of research for oil markets, energy and mobility at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

Haves and Have-Nots

As the fighting continues, traders have figured out that when it comes to oil there are haves and have-nots in the Middle East. Gaza produces no oil and Israel little. For there to be a material disruption in supply, the war’s effects would need to spread to the gigantic oil fields of Saudi Arabia, Iraq or Iran.

Early in the conflict, Iran’s foreign minister called for an oil embargo against Israel, stirring memories of the oil embargo of 50 years ago. But times have changed: Given concerns about the role that fossil fuels play in climate change and their dependence on oil for revenues, any such move would risk backfiring on countries that imposed such a ban. Iran would risk alienating China, the Islamic Republic’s key customer.

“The risk to supply is very unlikely to come from an independent decision to curtail oil sales by Iran or OPEC,” Eurasia Group said in a recent note. “Any such move would inflict as much — if not more — damage on producers as on consumers.”

The Remaining Risks

A disruption is not inconceivable. Four years ago, a missile attack on a key Saudi facility — for which American officials blamed Iran — temporarily knocked out about half of the kingdom’s oil production.

In an extreme case, Iran, the key backer of Hamas, could try to block the Strait of Hormuz, through which huge volumes of oil flow to the rest of the world. “I still think that there is considerable risk that this spreads,” said Helima Croft, head of commodities at RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank.

Ms. Croft said seeming complacency about the war’s impact could stem in part from traders’ having lost money when prices surged above $120 a barrel after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but then quickly fell.

“The market just has no attention span for these kinds of issues anymore,” she said.

Ms. Croft, a former analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency, said the apparent success of the early days of the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces eventually led to a conflict that dragged on for years. “We could still be caught by a nasty surprise in the Middle East,” she said.

The Biden administration is trying to prevent a widening of the war. Regional oil powers, including Iran, would also prefer to keep tanker traffic moving through the Persian Gulf. Any halts would crimp their own export earnings, while price spikes would risk hurting and alienating their most valued customers.

“It’s likely the conflict remains contained and doesn’t spill over into the big oil producers in the region or the key shipping lanes,” said Mr. Bronze of Energy Aspects. “The risks are more from miscalculation and misjudgment,” he added."
404,404,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/us/antisemitic-speech-palestine-israel-protests.html,"Ms. Babboni said her group is not antisemitic, but it is anti-Zionist. “We are fighting against a root cause, which is white supremacy, and trying to build a world which is beyond Zionism, beyond racism, beyond white supremacy,” she said.

Pro-Palestinian students like Ms. Babboni see their movement as connected to others that have stood up for an oppressed people. And they have adopted a potent vocabulary, rooted in the hothouse jargon of academia, that grafts the history of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples onto the more familiar terms of social justice movements at home.

Referencing resistance movements, the pro-Palestinian cause is “anticolonial.” Echoing the struggle against institutionalized racism in South Africa, Israel is an “apartheid regime.” Resonating with the concern for Native American land rights, the Palestinians are “Indigenous peoples.” Gaza is a form of mass incarceration, “Israel’s open-air prison.”

Each and every term is contested by pro-Israel students and activists.

They argue that many Jews are themselves refugees who fled pogroms and the Holocaust to return to their ancestral homeland, where they rebelled against British colonial rule to create their own state. They also argue that charges of racism betray a misunderstanding of the region, because it is estimated that half of Israelis are of Middle Eastern or North African descent.

Since the crisis began, statements and counterstatements have volleyed back and forth among college administrators, students, faculty and alumni. Every letter seems to beget another opposing it. Each takes issue with the language used by the others, and helps explain why the gyre of recriminations only widens with every new statement offered up by students or faculty."
405,405,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-instagram.html,"It was 4 a.m. when Motaz Azaiza fell asleep on Oct. 7.

The 24-year-old had been up late editing a video for a U.N. agency where he worked as a part-time producer, and watching “Friends” reruns.

Two hours later, he awoke to the sound of explosions and ran to his roof to see a barrage of rockets above him. There had been no warning, no exchange of fire that typically signaled a full-blown war. But one had started while he was asleep.

Hamas-led fighters had breached the barriers dividing Gaza from Israel, attacking soldiers and residents of nearby communities. Israeli officials said about 240 people were taken captive and around 1,400 people, mainly civilians but some soldiers, were killed in Israel.

In response, Israel launched a full-scale war against Hamas, trapping Mr. Azaiza and two million others under bombardment in Gaza, a tinderbox after decades of conflict.

Mr. Azaiza, who had already lived through four wars, grabbed his camera, and stepped out into an unraveling world.

Armed Palestinian men whizzed by in an Israeli military Jeep with three captives, two of them in uniform, and paraded them before residents, he said. Mr. Azaiza remembers the fear in one of the captive’s eyes.

He filmed the scene, uploading the video to his 24,000 Instagram followers.

“I didn’t even know what to feel,” he recalled. “We didn’t know that this Jeep was going to bring this disaster on us.”

Mr. Azaiza received a bachelor’s degree in English translation from a Gaza university, and had a passion for travel photography. He honed his craft capturing Gaza’s beauties and horrors.

But war in Gaza transformed him into a war correspondent for the social media age.

Now, he has 13 million Instagram followers.

Mr. Azaiza documents the effect of Israel’s bombardments in a way typical of his generation: raw footage filmed selfie-style, uploaded as stories. His English narration makes his reach global.

“I just post on my stories like everybody else,” he said. “I post videos from my daily life just like celebrities do,” he said.

But his videos are starkly different. On Oct. 9, Mr. Azaiza filmed himself crying after he survived an explosion.

“It just moved something within me,” he said. “I was traumatized, so I cried for two minutes.”

On Oct. 11, he said he lost his best friends in a strike on their home. Then, members of his extended family were killed. On Oct. 22, he stood over the corpses of dead babies. On Oct. 23, he walked over rubble and declared: “We still alive.”

“In the beginning, I didn’t know what I was doing or what I was covering,” he said. “I just wanted to document it and tell people that we are here. I am here.”

His coverage and fame has had a cost. He’s finding it hard to focus, exhausted by what he’s witnessed, and he’s scared for his safety. He’s witnessed the killing of colleagues, how their homes have crumbled in airstrikes, and said he pulled his friends from the rubble.

“Yesterday, I slept in the house. I had one leg on the bed and one leg on the floor,” Mr. Azaiza said. “I don’t know if I should stay or leave. My mother is distraught.”

On Nov. 4, Mr. Azaiza posted a video stating that he was no longer in Gaza City, and that it would be too risky to return because it was surrounded by Israeli troops.

While he promised to continue documenting the war, he reminded followers of his limitations: “I’m not superman.”

“I feel like my body is going to collapse,” he said to the camera. “I wish I can cover it all, but I’ll try to cover what I can without risking my life.”

Pentagon officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters, confirmed that the drone, an MQ-9 Reaper, had been shot down. But they would not say if the aircraft was armed, where it was flying from or other details.

The downing of a Reaper drone, the mainstay of the American military’s aerial surveillance fleet, was the latest escalation of violence between the United States and Iran-backed groups in Yemen, Iraq and Syria. The episodes have underscored the risks that the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas could spiral into a wider war.

On Oct. 19, a U.S. Navy warship in the northern Red Sea shot down four cruise missiles and more than two dozen drones launched from Yemen that the Pentagon said might have been headed toward Israel.

Yemen’s Houthi militia claimed it had attempted an attack on southern Israel on Oct. 31, saying it had launched a “large batch” of ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as drones, toward Israeli targets. The Israeli military said its aerial defense system had intercepted a surface-to-surface missile fired toward Israel “from the area of the Red Sea.” It said it had also intercepted other “aerial threats” in the area, none of which entered Israeli territory.

The Defense Department said on Wednesday that there had been at least 41 attacks on U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq by Iran-backed militias since Oct. 17. At least 46 U.S. service members have been injured, 25 of whom suffered traumatic brain injuries, the Pentagon said."
407,407,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/opinion/israel-palestine-war-family-loss.html,"My columns from Israel and the West Bank over the past few weeks have been depressing, reflecting my fear that we’re on a bloody, downward spiral that will make everything worse. So let me share what I saw as an ember of hope.

I didn’t expect to find such a thing. On this trip I met with civil society organizations that have toiled for years to bring Israelis and Palestinians together, but frankly I was skeptical of their efforts.

Some good that did, I was thinking. All those feel-good programs, often American-funded, to build bridges — and today we’re engulfed in war.

But let me tell you about an Israeli woman I met, Meytal Ofer: A couple of weeks ago, I sat down with her in Tel Aviv — 10 years to the month after two terrorists from Hamas murdered her father with 41 blows of an ax."
408,408,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/us/politics/blinken-gaza-palestinian-authority.html,"Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said Wednesday that Gaza should be unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority once the war is over, offering a strong signal about what the United States sees as its preferred endgame in the fight between Israel and Hamas.

The message, delivered during a meeting of foreign ministers in Tokyo, came as President Biden feels growing pressure to use his leverage to push for sustainable, long-term goals in the region and minimize civilian casualties. But increasingly, the United States and Israel are showing signs that their interests are diverging.

The remarks by Mr. Blinken on Wednesday reflect a deep anxiety on the part of Mr. Biden and his aides inside the White House as the conflict enters its second month. What started in the days after Oct. 7 as an unambiguous rush to the defense of an ally has become a much more complicated diplomatic challenge for the president to help define an alternative to open-ended war in the Middle East.

Mr. Biden wields key leverage as a world leader strongly allied with Israel, and his administration has sought to rally Arab nations and others behind a vision that looks beyond the fighting and the deep emotions that have divided the region for years.

On Wednesday, Mr. Blinken said there must be “affirmative elements to get to a sustained peace.”

“These must include the Palestinian people’s voices and aspirations at the center of post-crisis governance in Gaza,” he said. “It must include Palestinian-led governance and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.”

Mr. Blinken offered no details about how such an arrangement might be implemented; it would not be a solution in the near term as the violence continues. But restoring the Palestinian Authority — which administers parts of the West Bank — to power in Gaza would not be easy even if Israel managed to end Hamas’s rule. Its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, is deeply unpopular. Many Palestinians view him as corrupt and say his attempts to win independence through peace talks have failed.

“We don’t have it all figured out right now,” John F. Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said Wednesday on CNN. “And I don’t know that it would be reasonable for us to think that we could, at this particular point, one month into the conflict. But we know that it has to be something different than what it was under Hamas.”

In the immediate hours and days after Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7 and killed more than 1,400 people, Mr. Biden fully embraced Israel’s right to respond, a position that White House officials still repeat frequently.

But as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, Mr. Biden has tried to balance his support for Israel with calls for the protection of Palestinian noncombatants and for “humanitarian pauses” in the fighting.

Another potential split emerged this week, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel suggested that his country could hold a security role in Gaza “for an indefinite period” after the war is over. Mr. Kirby responded by saying that any re-occupation of Gaza by Israeli forces is “not the right thing to do.”

In his comments on Wednesday, Mr. Blinken made no reference to the presence of Israeli forces remaining inside Gaza, home to about 2 million Palestinians.

Mr. Biden has also come under pressure from some in the Democratic Party, which is deeply split on the conflict. On Wednesday, the majority of the Senate Democratic caucus signed a letter asking Mr. Biden to ensure that Israel has a viable plan for defeating Hamas and will use U.S. military assistance in keeping with international law.

Veterans of the often contentious diplomacy between the leaders of Israel and the United States said the willingness of the president and the secretary of state to be critical of Israel in public is a response to that dissatisfaction with Israel’s military campaign in Gaza."
409,409,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/us/politics/israel-college-campuses-hamas.html,"The candidates on the Republican debate stage on Wednesday were largely united in declaring their full-throated support for the Israeli government in its war with Hamas. But on how to grapple with responses to the conflict within the United States, they differed — a little bit.

When asked how they would respond to antisemitism on college campuses, the candidates vowed to crack down on student protesters, suggesting that pro-Palestinian activists were expressing support for Hamas. Only one, Vivek Ramaswamy, said students should not face retribution, defending their right to free speech.

Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina proposed ideological tests for universities to receive federal funding and said that he would deport students on visas who he claimed were “encouraging Jewish genocide.”

Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida played up his role in encouraging the State University System of Florida to ban chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine, saying, “We’re not going to use state tax dollars to fund jihad.” He criticized the Biden administration for initiatives to combat “so-called Islamophobia.”

And Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador and South Carolina governor, suggested that college administrators were more tolerant of antisemitism than they were of racism. “If the K.K.K. were doing this, every college president would be up in arms,” she said. “This is no different. You should treat it exactly the same. Antisemitism is just as awful as racism.”

Mr. Ramaswamy, too, denounced what he called the “scourge of antisemitism” and called students, who he said were “siding with Hamas,” “fools” who “have no idea what the heck they’re even talking about.” But he stopped short of calling for them to face punishment and called Mr. DeSantis and Ms. Haley “pro-censorship.”

“We don’t quash this with censorship, because that creates a worse underbelly,” he said. “We quell it through leadership by calling it out.”

Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor, was the only candidate asked about Islamophobia. He referred to his experiences as a United States attorney after the Sept. 11 attacks and said that he had combated hate crimes against Jewish Americans and Muslim Americans in New Jersey.

“It takes leadership to do this,” he said. “You must work with both sides.”"
410,410,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/middleeast/rashida-tlaib-palestine-israel.html,"The White House on Wednesday condemned Representative Rashida Tlaib for embracing a phrase used by some pro-Palestinian groups, a day after the House censured her for her statements regarding the Israel-Hamas war.

The White House was referring specifically to the phrase “from the river to the sea,” a slogan regarded by supporters of Israel as a rallying cry for the eradication of the country.

Ms. Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, has said the slogan is “an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction or hate.” Pro-Palestinian protesters used the slogan in a video Ms. Tlaib recently posted online that accused President Biden of supporting genocide in the Gaza Strip.

“When it comes to the phrase that was used, ‘from the river to the sea,’ it is divisive, it is hurtful, many find it hurtful and many find it antisemitic,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House spokeswoman, on Wednesday. “We categorically reject applying that term to the conflict.”

The House passed a resolution Tuesday evening to censure Ms. Tlaib, a Democrat from Michigan, for embracing that phrase and “promoting false narratives” surrounding Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed about 1,400 people, mostly civilians.

A video that Ms. Tlaib released Friday said that Mr. Biden “supported the genocide of the Palestinian people,” and she warned the president, who is from her own party, that “we will remember in 2024.”

A genocide is defined as the deliberate and systematic killing of members of a particular ethnic, national, racial or religious group in order to destroy that group. The Israeli military has said it is targeting Hamas, which carried out terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians, not the Palestinian people.

Thousands of people have died in Israeli airstrikes, including many children and other noncombatants, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.

The White House did not comment on the video last week and on Wednesday Ms. Jean-Pierre declined to comment on the House’s censure.

“We respect that there are strong feelings about the war,” Ms. Jean-Pierre said. “We have expressed our views ourselves in public and in private conversations with Israeli officials.”

But, she added, “Remember, Israel is defending itself from terrorists.”

The censure resolution, which passed 234 to 188, with 22 Democrats voting in favor, cited Ms. Tlaib’s use of the phrase “from the river to the sea,” which the Anti-Defamation League deems antisemitic. The resolution called the phrase “a genocidal call to violence to destroy the state of Israel and its people to replace it with a Palestinian state extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.”

Go to the table and, brass tacks here, “How are we going to end this war?” And we don’t support that at this time. A cease-fire right now benefits Hamas. It certainly also legitimizes what Hamas started on Oct. 7. It would give them a propaganda win. “See? Look, now there’s a cease-fire. And so we’re going to be an equal party to this. And we have every right to continue to stay in governance in Gaza.” And they don’t. And they’re not. So a cease-fire not only gives them time to plan and execute, but it legitimizes what they started on Oct. 7. And that’s unacceptable to President Biden. It’s certainly unacceptable, understandably so, to the Israeli people."
412,412,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/us/politics/biden-israel-palestinians-peace.html,"Even as President Biden presses Israel to define clearly the goals of its war against Hamas in Gaza, he is turning his eyes to a much larger endgame: the ever-elusive hope for a lasting peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.

Speaking to reporters last week, Mr. Biden said that “when this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next, and in our view it has to be a two-state solution,” creating a sovereign Palestinian nation alongside the state of Israel.

The question is how hard Mr. Biden intends to work for that outcome.

Until last month, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was not among his top priorities. A president focused on countering China and then Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had little time or inclination for a distant goal that stymied — and politically bruised — several of his predecessors.

Biden administration officials also doubted whether Israel’s increasingly hawkish leadership was interested in any plausible deal. They also wondered whether the Palestinians would trust the United States as a peace broker after four years of the Trump administration’s dramatically pro-Israel tilt and a Trump peace plan that the Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas, excluded from its devising, declared dead on arrival.

Unlike his recent predecessors, Mr. Biden did not appoint a special envoy for Middle East peace or task his secretary of state with trying to forge an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Instead, he focused on mediating a normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, hoping to leverage Israeli concessions to the Palestinians along the way.

“It was not a tier-one policy objective to solve this conflict,” said David Makovsky, a former peace process negotiator in the Obama administration. “The goal was to stabilize, and not trying and failing a fifth time.”"
413,413,https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000009172227/blinken-israel-gaza-west-bank.html,"When it comes to post-conflict governance in Gaza, a few things are clear and necessary. One, Gaza cannot be continued to be run by Hamas. That simply invites a repetition of Oct. 7 and Gaza used as a place from which to launch terrorist attacks. It’s also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza. Now, the reality is that there may be a need for some transition period at the end of the conflict, but it is imperative that the Palestinian people be central to governance in Gaza and in the West Bank as well, and that again, we don’t see a reoccupation. And what I’ve heard from Israeli leaders is that they have no intent to reoccupy Gaza and retake control of Gaza. So the only question is, is there some transition period that might be necessary, and what might be the mechanisms that you could put in place for that to make sure that there is security?"
414,414,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/us/politics/us-iran-airstrikes.html,"For the second time in nearly two weeks, the United States carried out airstrikes against a facility used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and its proxies in eastern Syria early Thursday, ratcheting up retaliation for a steady stream of rocket and drone attacks against American forces in Iraq and Syria.

The strikes by two Air Force F-15E jets against a weapons warehouse in Deir al Zour Province, Syria, came after U.S. airstrikes on Oct. 27 against similar targets in eastern Syria failed to deter Iran or its proxies in Syria and Iraq, which the Biden administration has blamed for the attacks.

Not only have the attacks continued — there have been at least 22 more since the American retaliatory strikes last month — but Pentagon officials said they have become more dangerous. Iran-backed militias have packed even larger loads of explosives — more than 80 pounds — onto drones launched at American bases, U.S. officials said.

“This precision self-defense strike is a response to a series of attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria by I.R.G.C.-Quds Force affiliates,” Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said in a statement. “The president has no higher priority than the safety of U.S. personnel, and he directed today’s action to make clear that the United States will defend itself, its personnel, and its interests.”

“The United States is fully prepared to take further necessary measures to protect our people and our facilities,” he added. “We urge against any escalation.”

The strikes also came after the Pentagon said a U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper surveillance drone was shot down over the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen on Wednesday by Iran-backed Houthi rebels.

The downing of the drone, the mainstay of the American military’s aerial surveillance fleet, was another escalation of violence between the United States and Iran-backed groups in the region. The episode underscored the risks that the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas could spiral into a wider war.

Biden administration officials have been trying to calculate how to deter the Iranian-backed Shiite militias from attacking American troops in the region without sparking that broader conflict, said three administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.

“The attacks, the threats coming from militia that are aligned with Iran, are totally unacceptable,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in Iraq on Sunday.

The Pentagon said on Wednesday that there had been at least 41 attacks on U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq since Oct. 17 and that at least 46 U.S. service members had been injured, 25 of whom had suffered traumatic brain injuries. The United States has 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria, mostly to help local forces fight remnants of the Islamic State.

In meetings to select targets, U.S. officials try to game out what response each strike will bring, one official said. Military officials at the Pentagon’s Central Command and in the American intelligence community have a good idea where many militia leaders are, two officials said, and have, in the past two weeks, considered the possible blowback if targeted airstrikes were to kill those leaders.

The effort to calibrate retaliation is inexact, the officials acknowledged. The strike against the weapons warehouse early Thursday was aimed at “disrupting and degrading” the abilities of the militias to carry out attacks against American troops, a senior Pentagon official told reporters after the strike.

But the strike was carried out late at night in Syria when the chances of hitting any Iranian personnel or militia fighters were small, Pentagon officials said.

The Biden administration also uses a “deconfliction” line with Russia to try to manage escalation in Iraq and Syria, two officials said. Russia has troops in Syria, and American officials say they expect that telling Russia before a strike in Syria, as officials did before the latest U.S. strike, is the same as telling Iran, because Russian officials often inform Tehran of what is coming.

Some congressional Republicans have criticized the administration for what they have said was a weak U.S. response to the steady stream of attacks by Iran-backed militias.

“Pin prick strikes against ammo dumps in the desert won’t do a damn thing to stop Iran from attacking our troops,” Representative Michael Waltz, a Florida Republican and former Army Green Beret, said in a post on X after the latest airstrikes.

The United States has been shifting military assets since Hamas’s surprise attack against Israel on Oct. 7 to try to prevent a regional war.

It has deployed one aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean near Israel and another now in the Red Sea heading south, as well as dozens of additional warplanes to the Persian Gulf region. The Pentagon has also rushed additional Patriot antimissile batteries and other air defenses to several Gulf nations to protect U.S. troops and bases in the region.

Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has repeatedly pledged to destroy Israel and repel U.S. military forces from the region, and the leaders of militant groups in Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Gaza view Mr. Khamenei as a powerful ally, often seeking his advice and consulting with him on strategic issues.

Despite the often fiery rhetoric from Tehran, U.S. officials assess that Israel’s adversaries are not seeking a wider war.

“We assess Iran, Hezbollah and their linked proxies are trying to calibrate their activity, avoiding actions that would open up a concerted second front with the United States or Israel, while still exacting costs in the midst of the current conflict,” Christine S. Abizaid, the leader of the National Counterterrorism Center, told a Senate panel last week. “This is a very fine line to walk.”"
415,415,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/us/politics/israel-gaza-ceasefire-pause.html,"Pause, or cease-fire?

The distinction is crucial to the crisis in Israel and Gaza. But world leaders keep getting confused by it.

During a visit to Washington last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada was asked whether he supported a cease-fire — a phrase generally understood to mean a stop to the fighting that can last for months or even years.

Israel and many Western governments oppose a cease-fire, saying that a long-term break in Israel’s offensive against Hamas would simply give the Palestinian terror group time to refortify and rearm.

The United States and several other nations, including members of the Group of 7 in a joint statement on Wednesday, are instead urging Israel’s government to agree to much shorter “pauses.” Such pauses are widely defined as breaks in the fighting of perhaps hours or days for specific humanitarian missions, such as aid delivery into blockaded Gaza and the potential release of hostages held by Hamas.

In a video that circulated widely online, Mr. Trudeau seemed momentarily unsure of which one he supported. “We need to see a cease — we need to see a humanitarian pause so we can flow — we need ceasing of the levels of violence that we’re seeing,” Mr. Trudeau said.

The distinction may seem minor to some, but not to Israel’s government. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week that “calls for a cease-fire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism.” But he has recently suggested an openness to brief “tactical pauses.”

Experts say neither term is defined under international law.

“The key difference relates to the purpose of the suspension — whether it is to allow a specific humanitarian activity to be conducted without risk of harm from the active fighting, or whether it is a generalized suspension of hostilities,” Emanuela-Chiara Gillard, an associate fellow at Chatham House in London, wrote in an essay on the subject this week.

“Suspensions of hostilities for specific humanitarian purposes tend to be limited in scope — in terms of duration and location,” Ms. Gillard noted. “Although they pause the fighting, this tends to be a brief and localized interruption.” They typically involve a highly specific agreement between the warring parties about matters like the precise time windows and routes granted to aid convoys or refugees.

By contrast, she added, cease-fires unrelated to specific humanitarian goals “can affect the achievement of the strategic military objectives of the hostilities.”

“The use of inconsistent and/or ambiguous terminology has contributed to the confusion,” she noted.

That confusion has even seemed to ensnare President Biden.

Confronted at a campaign event last week by a heckler demanding that he support a cease-fire, Mr. Biden momentarily suggested that he agreed with her position."
416,416,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/middleeast/rishi-sunak-palestinian-protest-london.html,"A pro-Palestinian demonstration planned for Saturday in London has become embroiled in a tense political debate that has put Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at odds with Britain’s most senior police official over whether the event should take place at all.

For the past four Saturdays, tens of thousands of people have marched in London to denounce the rising civilian death toll in Gaza as Israel bombarded the territory in response to the Hamas terror attacks last month.

Another march is planned for this Saturday, but Nov. 11 is also Armistice Day, when Britons remember the end of World War I. Mr. Sunak described the juxtaposition of the protest with some remembrance events as “provocative and disrespectful,” and has called for the pro-Palestinian protest to be banned.

Under British law, the police can apply for a march to be banned if there is a risk of serious public disorder, but the last time this power was used was more than a decade ago for a series of far-right marches.

While the Metropolitan Police Service did ask march organizers earlier in the week to postpone the demonstration, its leadership has so far resisted calls for a ban.

“The laws created by Parliament are clear,” Mark Rowley, the chief of the Metropolitan Police Service in London, said in a statement on Tuesday evening. “There is no absolute power to ban protest, therefore there will be a protest this weekend.”

Mr. Rowley added that while he recognized public and political concern about how the protest would affect a “moment of national reflection,” he was committed to ensuring the march would pass without disruption.

“The reason we have an independent police service is so that among debate, opinion, emotion, and conflict, we stand in the center, focused simply on the law and the facts in front of us,” he said.

Mr. Sunak, in a letter to Mr. Rowley late last week, had said “there is a clear and present risk that the Cenotaph and other war memorials could be desecrated,” although march organizers said they had no plans to march near the Cenotaph or Whitehall, where the remembrance events will take place.

Speaking on Wednesday, Mr. Sunak said Mr. Rowley would answer for his decisions.

“He has said that he can ensure that we safeguard remembrance for the country this weekend as well as keep the public safe,” he told Sky News. “Now, my job is to hold him accountable for that.” The two men were set to meet to discuss the event on Wednesday.

The vast majority of people attending previous Saturday demonstrations have been peaceful. But there have been some fringe elements, the police say, and more than 160 people have been arrested in London for a range of offenses, including racially motivated public offenses, violence and assaulting police officers, since the Hamas attack on Oct. 7."
417,417,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/business/workplace-middle-east.html,"Company executives have, over the past month, faced a dilemma that they’re by now well practiced in confronting: whether to engage with a large humanitarian or social issue, in this case the war between Israel and Hamas. This time, many say, responding — with a public statement, internal discussion, a donation or even social media parameters for staff members — presents complexities that they have not experienced when wading into other recent social crises.

“If you release a statement about the damage of a hurricane, there’s nobody who will say, ‘Actually that area of the country deserved a hurricane,’” said Iliya Rybchin, a partner at the consultancy Elixirr, who has advised dozens of Fortune 500 chief executives.

More than 200 American businesses have issued statements condemning the Hamas attacks in Israel that killed roughly 1,400 people, according to a tracker from Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. Some business leaders made donations to humanitarian organizations and pointed their employees to company-sponsored mental health resources. A smaller number said they also communicated to their staff about the rising death toll of civilians in Gaza.

Adding to the complexities that executives are weighing, many American companies have financial ties to Israel but few have business interests to consider in Gaza, Mr. Sonnenfeld noted.

“No company does business in Gaza — as opposed to, say, in Russia, where there are 1,500 major companies doing business,” he said, comparing this war with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “It’s zero in Gaza.”

Still, there is clear pressure to say something, partly because of the precedent set over the last several years, when many executives established a pattern of weighing in on social and political upheaval. In a Morning Consult poll of more than 2,000 Americans, conducted in mid-October, 58 percent said businesses should make a statement “condemning violence and loss of life” resulting from Hamas’s attacks, and 62 percent said companies should make humanitarian donations.

“It’s unlike any other topic I’ve seen in a decade of advising companies on these themes,” said Joelle Emerson, founder of Paradigm, a firm that has worked with more than 1,000 companies on diversity, equity and inclusion. “A lot of companies might not feel they have the context to comment intelligently on what’s happening.”

Even as the pressure for companies to comment on social issues accelerates, reasons for them to be reticent are also increasingly clear. Andrew Ward, a management professor at Lehigh University’s College of Business, noted that chief executives who were politically vocal sometimes drew negative attention to their businesses, which could affect workers. There are also financial considerations to wading in.

Gabe Zichermann, who runs workshops for companies on discussing contentious issues, said the protest against Bud Light this year after it hired a transgender influencer was “a watershed moment in corporate activism.” He added: “The boycott was able to really impact the company’s earnings very quickly. That’s steering people toward public neutrality.”

A handful of executives who condemned Hamas’s violence did so immediately and forcefully. David Solomon, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, wrote to his staff in Tel Aviv on Oct. 8, the day after the attack. “The dynamics in the Middle East have always been difficult and complex,” he wrote. “But, these attacks are terrorism and violate our most fundamental of values.”

At Warner Bros. Discover, David Zaslav, the chief executive, told his staff that he was “shocked and saddened” by the attacks, which he cited as “the deadliest in Jewish history since the Holocaust.” JPMorgan Chase’s statement called the war “a terrible tragedy.”

David Barrett, who runs the software company Expensify, which has roughly 140 employees, explained that before he issued an internal response to the war, he called meetings for his human resources leaders to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and review its historical and geopolitical context.

“We’re not historians,” Mr. Barrett said. “A lot of us didn’t understand the issue very well, didn’t understand the history, didn’t understand the kind of impact it was having on people.”"
418,418,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/europe/star-david-graffiti-france.html,"French prosecutors are investigating whether a foreign intermediary was behind the painting of more than 200 blue Stars of David on buildings in and around Paris last month amid a surge of antisemitic acts in Europe since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.

Investigators suspect that a man and a woman caught on surveillance footage painting some of the graffiti had communicated in Russian with a person who offered them money to spray the stars on buildings, Laure Beccuau, the Paris prosecutor, said in a statement on Tuesday.

The discovery of the stars — more than 60 were found in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on the morning of Oct. 31, while others have appeared in two suburbs of the capital — shocked many in France, where antisemitism is a longstanding concern. French Jews have also been targeted by terrorist attacks in recent years.

The man and the woman stenciled the stars in one sweep overnight and were accompanied by a third person who took photographs of the graffiti, Ms. Beccuau said, adding that the man and woman subsequently left France on Oct. 31."
419,419,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-gaza-war.html,"Some factions had signed accords with Israel, meant to pave the way for a two-state solution. The Palestinian Authority, envisioned as a Palestinian government in waiting, had limited authority over parts of the West Bank and remained officially committed to negotiating an end to the conflict.

Hamas, meanwhile, effectively sought to undo history, starting with 1948, when more than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes in what would become Israel during the war surrounding the foundation of the Jewish state.

For Hamas, that displacement, along with Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza during the 1967 Mideast war, was a great historical wrong that had to be righted by force of arms. Hamas dismissed peace talks with Israel as a betrayal, viewing them as a capitulation to Israel’s control over what the group considered occupied Palestinian land.

The Palestinian political rift became etched into geography in 2007, when Hamas won a bout of factional fighting in Gaza and took charge of the territory. Suddenly, it was not just fighting Israel, but also governing Gaza. Israel, in tandem with Egypt, imposed a blockade on the strip aimed at weakening Hamas, plunging Gazans into deepening isolation and poverty.

By the time Mr. Sinwar returned to Gaza, Hamas was already entrenched as the de facto government and had settled into what Tareq Baconi, a Hamas expert, has called a “violent equilibrium” with Israel. Deep hostility frequently erupted into deadly exchanges of Hamas rockets and Israeli airstrikes. But most of Gaza’s commercial goods and electricity came from Israel, and Hamas often sought to loosen the blockade during cease-fire talks.

Hamas leaders were ambivalent about the group’s new governing role, with some believing they needed to improve life for Gazans, and others considering governance a distraction from their original, military mission, experts say. Hamas derided the Palestinian Authority for its cooperation with Israel, including the use of Palestinian police to prevent attacks on Israel. Some Hamas leaders feared that their own group, in negotiating daily life issues with Israel, was, in a lesser way, on the same path.

In 2012, Mr. Sinwar became the armed wing’s representative to Hamas’s political leadership, linking him more tightly to the leaders of the military wing, including Mr. Deif, the mysterious head of the Qassam Brigades. The two men were key architects of the Oct. 7 attack, according to Arab and Israeli officials.

When Mr. Sinwar became the overall head of Hamas in Gaza in 2017, he sometimes projected an interest in accommodation with Israel. In 2018, he gave a rare interview to an Italian journalist working for an Israeli newspaper and appealed for a cease-fire to ease the suffering in Gaza.

“I am not saying I won’t fight anymore,” he said. “I am saying that I don’t want war anymore. I want the end of the siege. You walk to the beach at sunset and you see all these teenagers on the shore chatting and wondering what the world looks like across the sea. What life looks like,” he added. “I want them free.”

Hamas also issued a political program in 2017 that allowed for the possibility of a two-state solution, while still not recognizing Israel’s right to exist.

Israel granted some concessions, agreeing in 2018 to allow $30 million per month in aid from Qatar into Gaza and increasing the number of permits for Gazans to work inside Israel, bringing much needed cash into Gaza’s economy.

Violence continued to break out. In 2021, Hamas launched a war to protest Israeli efforts to evict Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem and Israeli police raids of the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem’s Old City.

That was a turning point, Osama Hamdan, a Hamas leader based in Beirut, Lebanon, told The Times. Instead of firing rockets over issues in Gaza, Hamas was fighting for concerns central to all Palestinians, including those outside the enclave. The events also convinced many in Hamas that Israel sought to push the conflict past a point of no return that would ensure the impossibility of Palestinian statehood.

“The Israelis were only concerned with one thing: How do I get rid of the Palestinian cause?” Mr. Hamdan said. “They were heading in that direction and not even thinking about the Palestinians. And if the Palestinians did not resist, all of that could have taken place.”

Building Capabilities

Still, in 2021, Israeli military intelligence and the National Security Council thought that Hamas wanted to avoid another war, according to people familiar with the assessments.

Hamas, too, bolstered the idea that it was prioritizing governing over battle. Twice, the group refrained from joining clashes with Israel started by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militia in Gaza. Hamas’s political leaders were trying through mediators in Qatar to increase the aid going into Gaza and the number of laborers going out to work in Israel, according to diplomats involved in the discussions.

Many in Israel’s security establishment also came to believe that its complex border defenses to shoot down rockets and prevent infiltrations from Gaza were enough to keep Hamas contained.

But inside Gaza, Hamas’s capabilities grew.

By Oct. 7, Hamas was estimated to have 20,000 to 40,000 fighters, with about 15,000 rockets, mainly manufactured in Gaza with components most likely smuggled in through Egypt, according to American and other Western analysts. The group had mortars, anti-tank missiles and portable air-defense systems as well, they said.

Mr. Sinwar had also restored the group’s ties to its longtime backer, Iran, which had frayed in 2012, when Hamas shuttered its office in Syria, a close Iranian ally, amid Syria’s civil war.

That restoration deepened the relationship between Hamas’s military wing in Gaza and the so-called axis of resistance, Iran’s network of regional militias, according to regional diplomats and security officials. In recent years, a stream of Hamas operatives traveled from Gaza to Iran and Lebanon for training by the Iranians or Hezbollah, adding a layer of sophistication to Hamas’s capabilities, the officials said."
420,420,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/opinion/biden-trump-israel-hamas.html,"The Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel and Israel’s retaliatory strikes on Gaza are creating a fissure between Democratic constituencies crucial to President Biden’s campaign for a second term in the White House.

A Nov. 2 Quinnipiac University poll found that half of surveyed voters approved of the way Israel is responding to the Oct. 7 attacks, while 35 percent disapproved. However, one key subgroup dissented — 18-to-34-year-olds — a constituency that provided Biden with enough votes in 2020 to put him over the top. These young voters faulted Israel’s response to the attacks, 52 to 32 percent.

Exit poll data from 2020 showed that Donald Trump beat Biden by small margins among the 60 percent of the electorate that was 45 or older, that Biden won 52 to 46 percent among the 23 percent of voters ages 30 to 44 and that the one bloc decisively in favor of Biden was voters ages 18 to 29, who made up 17 percent of the electorate and backed the Democratic nominee 60 to 36 percent.

Perhaps equally significant, in March 2023, more than six months before Hamas’s attack on Israel, Gallup found that “sympathy toward the Palestinians among U.S. adults is at a new high of 31 percent, while the proportion not favoring either side is at a new low of 15 percent. The 54 percent of Americans sympathizing more with the Israelis is similar to last year’s 55 percent, but it is the lowest since 2005.”

This shift in American public opinion toward Palestinians provides crucial insight into what my Times colleagues Jennifer Medina and Lisa Lerer wrote on Oct. 20:

Progressive Jews who have spent years supporting racial equity, gay and transgender rights, abortion rights and other causes on the American left — including opposing Israeli policies in Gaza and the West Bank — are suddenly feeling abandoned by those who they long thought of as allies. This wartime shift represents a fundamental break within a liberal coalition that has long powered the Democratic Party.

There is, Medina and Lerer added:

a politically engaged swath of American Jewry who are reaching a breaking point. They have long sought an end to the Israeli government’s occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, supported a two-state solution and protested the right-wing government of Benjamin Netanyahu. But in the Hamas attacks, many saw an existential threat, evoking memories of the Holocaust and generations of antisemitism, and provoking anxiety about whether they could face attacks in the United States. And they were taken aback to discover that many of their ideological allies not only failed to perceive the same threats but also saw them as oppressors deserving of blame.

Bruce Cain, a political scientist at Stanford, replied by email to my question on the domestic political consequences of the violence in the Middle East:

For Democrats, the Gaza war exacerbates pre-existing coalitional tensions along age, racial, religious and ideological lines. The pro-Hamas faction is younger, nonwhite, Muslim and secular and more progressive. The pro-Israel faction is older, whiter, Jewish and Christian and more centrist.

Biden cannot afford to lose even thin slices of the Democratic electorate, Cain argued: “As the Siena/NYT poll indicates, small swings in turnout of the Democratic base can doom Biden,” adding that this is what happened to Hillary Clinton “behind the blue curtain in 2016.”

“The longer and bloodier the war,” Cain added, “the harder it will be for the Democratic coalition.”

I asked Norman Ornstein, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, “Do you see the conflict hurting Biden’s prospects or helping them?” He replied by email: “Right now, there is no question it is dividing the Democratic base and hurting Biden’s approval.” But, he quickly added, “the election is a year away, and more important, all will be shaped by the outcome of the conflict.”

Biden’s support of Israel has produced exceptional, if not unprecedented, dissent among party loyalists and government employees.

On Nov. 3, Liz Skalka, Daniel Marans and Akbar Shahid Ahmed reported on HuffPost that more than 50 staff members of the Democratic National Committee had signed a letter calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.

“As strategic partners to the administration … we feel it is the D.N.C.’s moral obligation to urge President Biden to publicly call for a cease-fire,” they wrote. “With the number of civilian deaths growing rapidly each day, we must be clear: The Israeli government’s unrelenting military bombardment and blockading of vital supplies entering Gaza must end.”

Along similar lines, a Nov. 1 Foreign Policy article by Robbie Gramer disclosed that there was a “storm of dissent brewing in the State Department.”

A group of State Department employees opposed to administration policies is gathering signatures for a “dissent cable,” Gramer wrote, a formal procedure created by the State Department “to allow its users the opportunity to bring dissenting or alternative views on substantive foreign policy issues.”

Gramer reported that “many U.S. diplomats were privately angered, shocked and despondent by what they perceived as a de facto blank check from Washington for Israel to launch a massive military operation in Gaza at an immense humanitarian cost for the besieged Palestinian civilians in Gaza.”

In a separate Nov. 3 Foreign Policy article, “More U.S. Officials Are Anonymously Calling for a Gaza Cease-Fire,” Amy Mackinnon and Gramer wrote:

Hundreds of USAID (United States Agency for International Development) officials have reportedly signed a letter calling on the Biden administration to push for “an immediate cease-fire and cessation of hostilities” in the Israel-Hamas war, according to a copy of the petition obtained by Foreign Policy.

On Nov. 3, 56 Democratic members of the House and two senators wrote to Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, demanding that the administration “make clear that Israel must conduct military operations within the scope of international law and minimize civilian harm.”

“We must continue to hold ourselves and our closest allies to the highest standards of conduct,” the authors of the letter went on to say,

even at times of great tragedy and violence. While we firmly believe in Israel’s right to defend itself, we are gravely concerned by Israel’s military operation and conduct that fails to limit harm to noncombatants and vulnerable populations. Nearly 9,000 Palestinians have been killed, including over 3,600 children. Abiding by international law is not only morally imperative, but also legally required per international humanitarian law, and strategically important to prevent regional escalation and to preserve global support for Israel’s response to Hamas’s attack.

One underlying reason the Israel-Hamas conflict — including the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel and the Israeli counterattack on Gaza — is particularly problematic for Democrats is that psychological research shows that liberals are more inclined to feel empathy than conservatives.

In the May 2018 paper “Are Liberals and Conservatives Equally Motivated to Feel Empathy Toward Others?” Yossi Hasson, Maya Tamir, Kea S. Brahms, J. Christopher Cohrs and Eran Halperin reported that “on average and across samples, liberals wanted to feel more empathy and experienced more empathy than conservatives did.”

Their conclusion found support in a paper that was published in May, “Ideological Values Are Parametrically Associated With Empathy Neural Response to Vicarious Suffering,” by Niloufar Zebarjadi, Eliyahu Adler, Annika Kluge, Mikko Sams and Jonathan Levy of Aalto University in Finland. The authors used neuroimaging “to reveal an asymmetry in the neural empathy response as a function of political ideology.”

The research by Zebarjadi and her colleagues “revealed a typical rhythmic alpha-band ‘empathy response’ in the temporal-parietal junction. This neural empathy response was significantly stronger in the leftist than in the rightist group” of those studied.

Jeremy Konyndyk, who served as the director of USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance from 2013 to 2017, gave voice to this empathy in an interview with Politico about the Israel-Hamas conflict:

What the rest of the world sees is that when civilian apartment buildings are bombed by Russia in Ukraine, the U.S. government forcefully condemns this as illegitimate. And when they see similar tactics being used by the I.D.F. in Gaza, they see lock-step support from the U.S. government. This dramatically undermines the credibility of international humanitarian law. The fundamental foundation of international law is that certain things are wrong, full stop, because it happens to humans. That’s why it makes the attacks by Hamas wrong — deeply horrific and a grave violation of international humanitarian law. And that’s why it makes war crimes in response wrong.

One of the striking findings in polling conducted in the aftermath of Oct. 7 is how much more supportive young voters were of Hamas and how much less supportive they were of Israel.

An Oct. 19 Harvard/Harris poll asked 2,116 registered voters, “In general in this conflict do you side more with Israel or Hamas?”

By 84 to 16 percent, voters chose Israel, with everyone 25 or older backing the Jewish state by at least three to one. The one exception was voters 18 to 25, with 52 percent saying they sided with Israel and 48 percent with Hamas.

Asked, “Do you think the Hamas killing of 1,200 Israeli civilians in Israel can be justified by the grievances of Palestinians, or is it not justified?” an overwhelming majority of registered voters surveyed, 76 percent, said it could not be justified; 24 percent said it could be.

Among the youngest voters, however, 51 percent of those 18 to 24 said the killings “can be justified by the grievance of Palestinians,” and 49 percent said they could not be. Voters 25 to 34 were split, with 48 percent saying the killings of Israelis could be justified and 52 percent saying they could not.

In researching their March 2022 article, “The Young American Left and Attitudes About Israel,” Laura Royden and Eitan Hersh, political scientists at Harvard and Tufts, said they “surveyed 3,500 U.S. adults, including oversampling of 2,500 adults aged 18 to 30” to explore why “young people and the ideological far left have developed distinctly negative views toward Israel.”

“In June 2021,” they wrote, “immediately following armed conflict in Israel and Palestine, liberal Democrats were three times more likely than conservative Republicans to say that the U.S.A. was too supportive of Israel. Three in five Republicans, but only one in five Democrats, agreed in May 2021 that it was very important for the U.S.A. to help protect Israel.”

Among Democrats ages 18 to 35, however, they found that “respondents were three times more likely to say the U.S.A. should lean more toward Palestinians than Israel.”

Digging deeper, Royden and Hersh found a clear ideological and age pattern:

On both ideological extremes, more young adults than older adults hold an unfavorable view of Israel. Moderate young adult favorable attitudes toward Israel (58 percent) is indistinguishable from moderate older adults (at 62 percent). The difference is largest on the far left, where Israel favorability is 27 percentage points less among younger very liberal adults (at 33 percent) for young adults compared with older adults (at 60 percent). Young very conservative adults are supportive of Israel (66 percent), but substantially less so than older very conservative adults (82 percent). Clearly, the most left-leaning young adults have the lowest rating of Israel.

If many young people are disaffected with the Biden administration’s handling of the conflict between Hamas and Israel, their discontent pales in comparison with that of Muslim and Arab Americans.

The Arab American Institute commissioned John Zogby Strategies to conduct a survey of 500 Arab Americans from Oct. 23 to Oct. 27. For Biden, the results were striking: “Support for President Biden in the upcoming election has plummeted among Arab Americans voters, dropping from 59 percent in 2020 to 17 percent, a 42-point decrease.”

Two-thirds of Arab Americans had “a negative view of President Biden’s response to the current violence in Palestine and Israel,” according to the poll. “A strong majority of Arab Americans believe the U.S. should call for a cease-fire on the current violence.”

In terms of partisan identification, Zogby wrote in his summary, the survey

marks the first time in our 26 years of polling Arab American voters in which a majority did not claim to prefer the Democratic Party. In 2008 and 2016, Democrats outnumbered Republicans by two to one. In this poll, 32 percent of Arab Americans identified as Republican, as opposed to just 23 percent who identified as Democrats.

In 2020, Biden carried Michigan by 154,181 votes. Arab Americans played a significant role in his victory there.

Farah Pandith, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, pointed out in an email that until recently, Muslim Americans had become a core Biden constituency:

In 2020, American Muslims were involved in fund-raising and volunteering in the Biden campaign. They were mobilizing themselves to get Muslims out to vote, to educate and to — importantly — be publicly seen doing so. With so much hardship in the years post-9/11 and accusations that American Muslims could not be loyal Americans and practicing Muslims, this dedicated effort is compelling. These generations not only wanted to debunk that false narrative, but they wanted to see their candidate win — believing that Biden would understand their lived experience in America in a post-9/11 world and govern accordingly.

Now, Pandith wrote, “it is clear that the hard-won trust and warm relationship Biden enjoyed with the vast number of American Muslims has been diminished. For many, their confidence in and loyalty to Biden has seemed to evaporate.”

I asked a political operative closely tied to the Biden campaign — who insisted on anonymity in order to speak forthrightly — about the ramifications of the struggle between Israel and Hamas. The person responded:

There are open wounds, and we are far from the war’s end. And there are hostages still out there. And Americans both tire and get bored with foreign conflicts after the messy part is done. But I do know one thing: Trump was the president of the Muslim ban, and he called for a Muslim ban 2.0, so I don’t think a lot of Arab Americans are going his way. I think there is time for Biden to get them back. Not all of them.

Julie Wronski, a political scientist at the University of Mississippi, argued by email that concern over Biden’s problems in dealing with the Middle East conflict may be overblown:

Americans traditionally do not hold consistent or well-informed opinions on foreign policy. The further a foreign conflict or global issue is removed from people’s day-to-day lives, the less they are going to hold any meaningful opinion about it or use it to guide their political preferences.

In addition, Wronski continued, “the role of negative partisanship may outweigh Muslim Americans’ criticisms of Biden’s foreign policy.” Some voters may defect to a third-party candidate or abstain from voting, but “a potential second Trump term can be more threatening to Muslim Americans domestically, given Trump’s record and rhetoric toward minority and marginalized groups, than Biden’s foreign policy agenda.”

I asked Stephen Ansolabehere, a professor of government at Harvard, for his perspective. He replied by email:"

I’m David Firestone. I’m a member of the editorial board of The New York Times. I write about politics and government. Mike Johnson was the fifth choice, I believe, of members of the House who went through an agonizing three weeks to try and find a speaker.

He wasn’t going to play games. He wasn’t going to see every bill as a political game. And it’s been a long time since we’ve had leaders like that in the Republican Party. I still held out some hope that maybe they could find someone who would take that role. But it’s pretty clear that that’s not what the party wants right now. That’s not what voters want. The same voters who want Donald Trump to be the leader of their party also want someone who’s not serious to be the speaker of the House. During the three weeks when they were deciding who was going to be the speaker after Kevin McCarthy was deposed, they went through a number of different candidates, a few who were more to the center.

And they finally settled on somebody who really didn’t have much of a record. He’s never been in leadership. And he was considered neutral in the various factions that go on within the House. It later came out, after people started looking at his record, that he was very, very far to the right when it comes to social and cultural issues. He is profoundly anti-abortion. He is against same-sex marriage. He has written about the importance of religion in public life as a guiding factor, which is very disturbing to people who want to see a separation between church and state. So people in the center and people on the left started to get a little nervous about what kind of a speaker he would be. And then some of their worst fears were confirmed about a week later when President Biden’s request came over to provide billions of dollars for Ukraine, for Israel, and for Taiwan. [MUSIC PLAYING] So Mike Johnson proposed a bill, which the House later passed pretty much along party lines, that eliminates all funding for Ukraine, eliminates funding for Taiwan, and only gives money to Israel. The Ukraine money was deleted because there are many on the right wing of the Republican Party who have followed Trump’s lead and decided that Putin’s aggression in Ukraine is not really so bad. If there was any hope that Michael Johnson was going to counter that and take a significant role in restoring the United States to a position where it can support democratic values around the world, that pretty much was lost when he put something incredibly unserious in the bill, the cut to the IRS. He said that in order to get the money for Israel, that President Biden would have to agree to cut the exact same amount out of the budget for the Internal Revenue Service. That money had been designated as part of the Inflation Reduction Act that Biden passed earlier to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. If they insist on that, there’s not going to be a bill that gets passed because the Senate won’t go along with it. That means there won’t be any money, not just for Ukraine, but for Israel either. It will send a message to the rest of the world that the United States will not be there for them, that we just really don’t care about what’s going on in the rest of the world. You’re on your own. The United States is not going to help you. In a few days we’re also going to see another huge issue facing the House. That’s the deadline when the stopgap runs out on November 17. The government is going to shut down if the House and Senate can’t agree on a measure to keep the government open. To make that happen, the House has to have some leadership, has to have a plan that senators agree on. And Mike Johnson is already talking about adding a whole bunch of other conditions to keeping the government open and preventing a shutdown.

422,422,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/opinion/israel-war-colleges.html,"It was a relief to learn of the arrest last week of a 21-year-old Cornell University student for threatening to rape and murder Jews on campus in reaction to the Israel-Hamas war. It was also an easy case: Violent threats against specific people are illegal, and they are dealt with by the justice system, not school administrators.

Easy cases are hard to come by these days, especially at colleges and universities, where the divisions over the Middle East conflict are starker than in any other sector of American society. Examples abound of abhorrent speech by students and faculty members, mostly aimed at Israel, Jews and even Jewish students — and yet abhorrent does not equal criminal. How should a university respond when members of its community express sentiments that are at odds with the values the school is trying to inculcate, not to mention with human decency?

There are answers, and they won’t make everyone happy. They start with a core value that too often gets lost in the heat of these debates: Speech should be presumptively allowed, as a basic principle of free inquiry and academic debate. The details of achieving that may get messy fast, but the goal is fundamental on campuses. While schools have faced challenges like these before, more recent developments in campus politics and civility can help ensure that colleges don’t lose their way or make themselves vulnerable to partisan attacks and regulations.

Unfortunately, the universities themselves have done their part to add to the mess. By taking public positions on some high-profile political issues but not others in recent years, they have exposed themselves to charges of inconsistency and bias. By imposing speech codes that ban what they deem offensive speech without clearly defining it, they have encouraged illiberalism in an environment designed to cultivate the liberal arts. And by relying increasingly on an ever-shrinking number of ultrawealthy donors, they have put themselves at risk of losing huge amounts of money if the donors decide they don’t like what is being said (or not said) in the university’s name.

As a result, many schools have flailed, some more than once, in their attempts to navigate the storms of speech, activism and vitriol that have consumed their communities over the past month. Administrators continue to face intense pressure to make statements and take sides, whether from students, faculty members, donors or lawmakers.

One solution is to say nothing or as little as possible. This is known as the University of Chicago approach, after that school issued a report in 1967 urging neutrality in response to student protests against the Vietnam War.

“The neutrality of the university as an institution arises then not from a lack of courage nor out of indifference and insensitivity,” the university said in the report, named after its principal author, Harry Kalven Jr. “It arises out of respect for free inquiry and the obligation to cherish a diversity of viewpoints.”

That’s easier said than done, as the report admitted. Universities are not sealed off from the wider culture, nor should they be. Still, every institutional foray into politics comes with risks.

“There’s no answer that will please everybody,” Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the Berkeley School of Law and an expert on free speech, told me. “I put out a statement, the first sentence of which said I’m horrified by the terrorism that occurred in Israel. I got called a racist for that statement, because it labels it as terrorism.” He pointed out, however, that silence can speak just as loudly. “I didn’t issue any statement condemning students who defended Hamas. I got criticized for that.”

Mr. Chemerinsky wasn’t complaining about the criticism — he’s heard far worse — but even he was shocked by the degree of antisemitism he has been seeing on campus in recent weeks, much of it without meaningful pushback from university administrators.

At public universities like Berkeley, the First Amendment provides broad speech protections. At private universities, that permissiveness is not constitutionally required, but it is (or should be) part of the academic culture. All schools are obligated to follow Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination based on race, color or national origin. The trick is in balancing a commitment to open, uninhibited debate with ensuring that students do not fear for their physical safety from those who disagree with them.

That’s why a university’s primary role should be to create a haven — a safe space — for open debate that emphasizes listening and mutual respect, if not agreement. “To be open to both all people and all ideas,” as Suzanne Nossel, who leads PEN America, put it. “The imperative is to make room for vigorous debate, airing ideas that are offensive or make people uncomfortable. That’s imperative in a moment like this. The answer can’t be to shut down that debate.”

True, and yet Jewish students can be forgiven for wondering why they must endure their professors referring to a terrorist slaughter of Jews as exhilarating and their fellow students calling to get rid of the Zionists. In an age of heightened sensitivity to the real harm that speech can inflict, it seems Jewish students are expected to take it on the chin.

The bottom line is that universities undermine their basic purpose if their students feel in physical danger. Administrators can and should speak out in defense of the safety of their students and the values of their academic community, even if doing so means weighing in on a larger political debate.

As colleges and universities have been discovering, a culture of basic respect and listening doesn’t appear magically. It is unreasonable to expect that students barely out of high school, not yet fully grown in body or mind, should just know how free-speech culture works, even as they are entering what for many of them is the most pluralistic environment they’ve ever encountered. “It’s work!” Ms. Nossel said. “It’s the work of democratic citizenry, how we live together and make space for one another’s ideas.”

That’s why it’s important to make it a mandatory part of first-year education, at the least, akin to the way students are trained to spot and prevent sexual harassment and assault.

The point isn’t to engender some vague idea of civility but rather to instill the importance of building a pluralistic society.

Obviously there are legal red lines to a culture of free speech: threats, intimidation and harassment, to name the obvious ones. But universities can add their own limits — for instance, no targeting of specific students or of groups because of identity.

The rules and limits are likely to be different based on regions and varying campus cultures, but they should err toward permissiveness, and they should be clear and consistent and be communicated in advance. That will give students the opportunity to learn while at school and to consider the ramifications of their speech not just in the school environment but also in their lives after graduation. (The recent warning by a group of top law firms that they will not tolerate a history of antisemitic or anti-Islamic behavior from applicants for jobs should stand as a reminder to students of the real-world consequences of their campus behavior.)

Schools must also make it clear to donors that their contributions cannot have political strings attached. Two recent cases in which donors or lawmakers objected to the hiring of Black journalists as tenured faculty members — one at the University of North Carolina and the other at Texas A&M — illustrate how corrupting it is to a university’s core mission when outsiders with money or power control academic decisions.

Finally, lawmakers who control the budgets and agendas of state universities need to respect the same educational goals that academic leaders do, especially because these institutions educate far more students than elite private schools do. This year, to cite one prominent example, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida signed three bills that restrict certain topics from being taught — including theories of racial history — and prohibit campuswide diversity statements. Several Republican members of Congress have introduced a misguided bill in the House to cut funding for colleges that allow what is loosely defined as antisemitic speech on campus, including claims that Jews are more loyal to Israel than their own nations.

Lawmakers — no less than donors, administrators, educators and students — have a role to play in fostering the sort of culture that universities are uniquely suited to embody, and that is a building block in the maintenance of a free, pluralistic society."
423,423,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/europe/germany-school-anne-frank.html,"Amid the heightened tensions in Germany, the newspaper’s report prompted Jewish leaders and politicians to speak out.

But on Wednesday, the mayor of Tangerhütte, Andreas Brohm, said in an interview that the day care center had decided to end the discussion about changing its name following the outcry.

He was speaking ahead of a town council meeting Wednesday when the main political parties were expected to put forward a joint position blocking any name change.

“The discussion has stopped,” Mr. Brohm said in a telephone interview.

On Sunday, Christoph Heubner, executive vice president of the International Auschwitz Committee, issued an open letter, in which he said Mr. Brohm and others responsible for the center were consciously turning their backs on Anne Frank.

“When people, especially in these times of renewed antisemitism and far-right extremism, are prepared to nonchalantly clean up their own history and consider the name of Anne Frank to be no longer desirable in the public space, it sets off alarm bells and sends out warnings concerning the fate of remembrance culture in our country,” he said in a statement accompanying the letter.

A nonprofit organization, Miteinander e.V., which supports democratic society in Saxony-Anhalt, warned about right-wing extremists using the debate to criticize immigrants. “We appeal to parents, day care center management and the city parliament to make a prudent and responsible decision in the face of a massive rise in antisemitism,” it said.

On Monday, as criticism mounted, the town issued a statement which said that, in fact, nothing had yet been decided about a new name, which had been under consideration for some months.

As early as July 2023, the town said, the topic of new name arose as the day care center considered other changes. “These discussions are still ongoing without a decision being made at the moment,” the town said

In that statement, Mr. Brohm said, “We have received many constructive suggestions and proposals, for which we are very grateful.”

The statement added, “Tangerhütte, with its educational institutions and all its civic engagement, stands for an open-minded Germany that is at the same time as aware of its historical responsibility as it is of its educational mission.”

Wolfgang Schneiß, an official overseeing issues of Jewish life in the state government, said in an interview Tuesday that he assumed the town would reject the idea.

“I and the government of Saxony-Anhalt have no sympathy for such a renaming,” he said in an email. “It does not fit our times. There are many good ways of communicating the topic of Anne Frank to young children in a contemporary way, especially to people with a migration history.”

Sven Schulze, a government minister in Saxony-Anhalt, said that members of his Christian Democratic Union party serving on Tangerhütte’s town council would not support the renaming. “Not only in today’s world, but in general, such a suggestion is completely absurd, instinctive and small-minded,” he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.

The chairman of the town council told the German news media that he and other council members would put forward a resolution to reject the renaming and would call on the mayor to issue a clear statement against any change.

“On Wednesday, the city council will unanimously take a position against the request to rename the day care center,” the chairman, Werner Jacob, told the Welt newspaper.

Instead, he has called for “humanitarian pauses” to Israel’s bombing campaign — so far rebuffed by Israel — to allow the delivery of aid and movement of civilians. That concept has fallen flat in Arab nations, where many view it as a weak proposal that shows the U.S. is either unwilling or unable to hold Israel back.

“Everyone who supported Israel in this bloody war is its partner — especially those who practice contradiction by calling for a humanitarian truce while at the same time rejecting a cease-fire,” Khalid al-Suleiman, a columnist, wrote in the Saudi newspaper Okaz.

Jordan and Turkey have recalled their ambassadors to Israel in protest over the war, while United Nations officials have implored Israel not to impose “collective punishment” on Gazans for atrocities committed by Hamas.

In the Gulf kingdom of Bahrain, which established relations with Israel in 2020 in an American-brokered deal, the relatively powerless Parliament issued an unusual statement last week declaring that their country had recalled its ambassador to Israel, too. But that was followed by a denial by the Israeli government — and an oblique statement from the Bahraini government saying that its ambassador had “returned to Bahrain some time ago,” without explaining why.

That ambiguous message reflects the challenges Bahrain’s American-allied royal family faces as they balance protecting their ties with the U.S. and Israel with insulating themselves from popular anger.

Bahrainis have taken to the streets repeatedly over the past month, declaring their solidarity with the Palestinians and carrying posters labeling President Biden a “war criminal.” Riot police have confronted the crowds — some of the biggest since the government crushed an Arab Spring revolt a decade ago — and fired tear gas.

“I have not seen such a large number in a spontaneous demonstration in Bahrain for a long time,” said Ibtisam al-Sayegh, a human-rights activist who attended a protest last month. Some Bahrainis carried signs depicting their king holding hands with Mr. Netanyahu — accusing the monarch of complicity in the murder of Palestinians as long as Bahraini relations with Israel continue, she said."
425,425,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/opinion/us-jewish-israel-sept-11.html,"There used to be a sign (which, for all I know, is still there) somewhere in the C.I.A.’s headquarters that read, “Every day is Sept. 12.” It was placed there to remind the agency’s staffers that what they felt right after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 — the sense of outrage and purpose, of favoring initiative over caution, of taking nothing for granted — had to be the mind-set with which they arrived to work every day.

There ought to be a similar sign in every Jewish organization, synagogue and day school, and on the desks of anyone — Jewish or not — for whom the security and well-being of the Jews is a sacred calling: “Every day is Oct. 8.”

What was Oct. 8? It wasn’t just the day after the single greatest atrocity against Jews since the Holocaust, an atrocity whose details were impossible to miss because the perpetrators made sure to film them. It was the day when that atrocity was celebrated. Not just in places like Tehran, but also on the streets of Manhattan and on too many college campuses. And it was the day in which, instead of it being universally denounced by institutional leaders, we began to see it often ignored or addressed in belated and carefully parsed statements of regret.

On Oct. 8, Jews woke up to discover who our friends are not.

Our friends are not those members of the Black Lives Matter movement — whose stickers and lawn signs so many American Jews posted in allyship after George Floyd’s murder — who celebrated Oct. 7 with a post extolling the Hamas paragliders who slaughtered Jews at a music festival. B.L.M. chapters later apologized for the since-deleted post, but the apology isn’t accepted. They knew what they were doing.

Our friends are not those in organizations like Jewish Voice for Peace, which helped organize a much-photographed protest at New York’s Grand Central Terminal, and which could hardly bring itself to say a word of condemnation for Oct. 7 before launching into lengthy justifications. Let’s be clear: They and their sibling groups are being used as Jewish beards for aggressive antisemites."
426,426,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/us/politics/tlaib-censure-house-israel-gaza.html,"The House voted on Tuesday to censure Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, formally rebuking the sole Palestinian American in Congress for her statements regarding the Israel-Hamas war.

Twenty-two Democrats joined most Republicans to pass the resolution, which accuses Ms. Tlaib of “promoting false narratives” surrounding Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel and of “calling for the destruction of the state of Israel.” The vote was 234 to 188. Four Republicans voted against censuring Ms. Tlaib, while one Democrat and three Republicans voted “present,” declining to take a position.

After the gavel fell, Democratic lawmakers, mostly progressives, surrounded Ms. Tlaib on the floor and embraced her.

The Democratic support for reprimanding one of their own reflected an increasingly intense division in the party over the Israel-Hamas war. While many Democrats are staunchly supportive of Israel, there is mounting pressure from the progressive left to call for a cease-fire and focus on the suffering of the Palestinian people in the face of ballooning civilian deaths and a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Ms. Tlaib has been by far the most vocal member of Congress to do so.

The measure, offered by Representative Rich McCormick, Republican of Georgia, argued that a statement Ms. Tlaib made after Hamas’s attack on Israel — calling for the end of “the apartheid system that creates the suffocating, dehumanizing conditions that can lead to resistance” — “defended” terrorism.

It also cited Ms. Tlaib’s embrace of the phrase “from the river to the sea,” a pro-Palestinian rallying cry that many regard as calling for the eradication of Israel and has been deemed antisemitic by the Anti-Defamation League. The resolution called the phrase “a genocidal call to violence to destroy the state of Israel and its people to replace it with a Palestinian state extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.”

Ms. Tlaib has said the slogan, which was used by pro-Palestinian protesters featured in a video she posted accusing President Biden of supporting genocide in Gaza, is “an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction or hate.”

During debate of the resolution, Ms. Tlaib grew emotional on the House floor as she reiterated her calls for a cease-fire, defended her criticism of the Israeli government and pleaded for sympathy for the plight of the Palestinian people.

“I can’t believe I have to say this, but Palestinian people are not disposable,” she said, appearing to choke back tears as Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, stood up to comfort her. “The cries of the Palestinian and Israeli children sound no different to me.”

Ms. Tlaib said her criticism had “always been” of the Israeli government, not the Israeli people, and warned her colleagues that the movement urging a cease-fire was “growing every single day.”

“You can try to censure me, but you can’t silence their voices,” she said.

The debate pitted mainstream Democrats against the most progressive lawmakers in the House, many of them women of color who surrounded Ms. Tlaib on the floor as the censure was considered. Representative Ayanna S. Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, defended Ms. Tlaib and called the resolution “blatantly Islamophobic, anti-democratic and an utter waste of time.” Ms. Pressley, who is Black, argued that the measure was brought by Republicans “obsessed with policing progressive women of color.”

Other Democrats, however, have condemned Ms. Tlaib’s statements.

Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the minority leader, said in a statement before the vote that echoing “slogans that are widely understood as calling for the complete destruction of Israel — such as ‘from the river to the sea’ — does not advance progress toward a two-state solution. Instead, it unacceptably risks further polarization, division and incitement to violence.”

And Representative Brad Schneider of Illinois, the lone Democrat who sided with Republicans in a vote earlier in the day allowing the resolution to move forward, accused Ms. Tlaib of “trying to gaslight the world and give cover” to those using the “river to the sea” slogan.

“I will always defend the right to free speech,” Mr. Schneider said in a statement. “Tlaib has the right to say whatever she wants. But it cannot go unanswered.”

Last week, the House struck down a different censure of Ms. Tlaib offered by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, that accused Ms. Tlaib of “antisemitic activity” and called an Oct. 18 protest in a House office building, at which Ms. Tlaib had accused Israel of genocide, an “insurrection.”

Ms. Greene reintroduced her censure resolution after amending it to refer to the Oct. 18 protest as an “illegal occupation” of a House office building. The House had planned to consider it Tuesday night, but Ms. Greene withdrew the resolution after the House voted to allow Mr. McCormick’s measure to move forward.

Representative Ken Buck, Republican of Colorado, opposed Ms. Greene’s resolution last week and said he would not support the others either.

“It’s not our job to censure somebody because we don’t agree with them,” he said. “Let the Ethics Committee look at it. Let others look at it, but I will not be voting for a motion to censure unless it’s very serious conduct.”

It is rare for a member of Congress to be censured, which amounts to a public reprimand one step below expulsion. Before June, the House had censured its own members just 24 times in the chamber’s history. But censure resolutions increasingly have been used in recent months to trade criticism and partisan blame across the aisle.

In its first week of legislative business after a month of paralysis because of the chaotic speaker’s race, the House considered two censure resolutions back to back. Since then, at least three more censure resolutions have been introduced.

The measures are privileged under House rules, meaning that they take precedence over other legislative business and are not subject to the discretion of congressional leaders.

They hadn’t gone far on Saturday, she said, when they came under fire.

They fled their car before a shell hit it, sending it and their luggage up in flames, Ms. Al Salya, 20, said in a telephone interview. The family returned north on foot, walking between bloody bodies sprawled along the road, she said.

“It was a horror situation,” she said. “I’m in total shock.” Ms. Al Salya said she believed the shell that hit the car had been fired by an Israeli tank; the Israeli military declined to comment on the incident.

Despite intensifying Israeli ground operations, continued air and artillery strikes, a mounting death toll and a critical lack of resources, hundreds of thousands of people remain in northern Gaza. In interviews, some who have chosen to stay say the trip is too dangerous, or the way has been blocked, or that the south, also being bombed, seems no safer, despite Israeli assurances. For some, the indignities of forced displacement are too much to bear.

Even some foreign-passport holders and dual nationals who are being allowed to leave Gaza say they will not take the deadly risks involved in getting to the only exit, the Rafah border crossing into Egypt. That includes Ms. Al Salya and her family, who are British Palestinians living in Jabaliya, a built-up refugee camp just north of Gaza City, where some of the most intense ground combat has taken place. She said they hope to try again.

Ahmed Ferwana, who lives in the Al Shati camp a short distance to the west, is a Swiss national and was on the list of those who could have left the territory last week, but he thought it was too dangerous to venture to Rafah, about 25 miles away.

“I don’t want to walk to death with my own legs,” he said in a telephone interview on Sunday.

Hours later, his neighborhood was hit by heavy airstrikes that he said lasted all night. Videos on social media and verified by The New York Times showed that an entire block was leveled. It was the most difficult night of the war, Mr. Ferwana said later. But still, he felt it was “better to die at home than to die on the street.”

Asked about reports Israeli troops had fired on civilians on the road, the Israeli military said in a statement that it had been targeting Hamas throughout the Gaza Strip and that its strikes on military targets were subject to international law, including taking “feasible precautions to mitigate civilian casualties.”

The Gazan interior minister, Iyad al-Bazam, said on Tuesday that 900,000 people remained in northern Gaza, and that Jabaliya and Al Shati were the most densely populated areas. David Satterfield, U.S. special envoy for Mideast humanitarian issues, estimated on Saturday that at least 350,000 to 400,000 people remained in northern Gaza."
429,429,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/us/politics/house-republicans-spending-shutdown.html,"House Republicans on Tuesday grasped for a way to avert a government shutdown amid deep divides in their ranks over federal spending, debating how to strike a compromise with the Democratic-led Senate and President Biden just 10 days away from the funding deadline.

There was little movement in either the House or the Senate as lawmakers sorted through a litany of possible funding mechanisms, none of which enjoy strong support in either chamber. They found themselves back in the same predicament they confronted in September, when Congress narrowly avoided a shutdown just hours before the deadline.

With the House under the stewardship of a new, untested leader, Speaker Mike Johnson, lawmakers in both parties were uncertain what he might do.

“It’s all as clear as mud,” Representative Drew Ferguson, Republican of Georgia, said as he emerged from a closed-door meeting in the basement of the Capitol where Mr. Johnson briefed his members on a series of potential spending strategies.

Just a month ago, hard-right, anti-spending Republicans ousted Speaker Kevin McCarthy after he narrowly pushed through legislation to avoid a shutdown and extend the federal funding deadline to Nov. 17 using Democratic votes.

With that temporary funding measure set to expire in days, Mr. Johnson appears set on avoiding a repeat of the circumstances that doomed his predecessor. That means he will need to corral nearly all Republicans to pass a government funding measure, a considerable feat given his party’s resistance to federal spending.

“We certainly want to avoid a government shutdown,” Mr. Johnson said. “It’s a dangerous time around the world right now. We recognize that, and we’re doing our job.”

Mr. Johnson said House Republicans would reveal their plan to fund the government “in short order.”

While the hard-right Republicans who ousted Mr. McCarthy say they are willing to give the considerably more conservative Mr. Johnson more latitude than his predecessor, the task in some ways has become more fraught. Now in addition to facing yet another shutdown scenario, Congress is also debating a separate request from Mr. Biden for $105 billion in emergency national security aid for Israel and Ukraine.

At a closed-door meeting underneath the Capitol on Tuesday morning, Mr. Johnson presented a menu of spending strategies to his conference. It included passing a temporary measure that would extend government funding into early 2024 that contains a handful of conservative policies and negotiating a deal directly with the Senate.

Some hard-right conservatives have backed a third option, which Mr. Johnson also discussed, that would fund some government agencies for only a few weeks, and others for a longer period."
430,430,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/world/middleeast/thai-hostages-hamas-gaza-israel.html,"The foreign minister of Thailand said Tuesday that officials he had met in Qatar and Egypt indicated the Thai hostages held by Hamas and other armed groups would be the next to be released because they had nothing to do with the war.

Thai officials working to secure the release of 24 Thai agricultural workers have seen photos of the hostages who were abducted on Oct. 7 in southern Israel, Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara said.

Thai nationals comprise the second largest group of the estimated 240 people taken hostage, after Israelis.

Thailand has been trying to reach Hamas through intermediary governments in Iran, Qatar, Egypt and Malaysia. Officials from Malaysia, which hosts Hamas-linked representatives and does not maintain diplomatic relations with Israel, have told their counterparts in Thailand that the Thai hostages are alive, and the Thai army chief has seen photos of the captives, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin of Thailand said on Monday.

Mr. Srettha did not specify how many hostages were shown in the photos. But he said that he was hopeful that the Thais would be released as soon as there is a lull in the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.

Mr. Parnpree went to the Middle East last week to work on securing their release. On Tuesday, he said that he, too, had seen photos of hostages in “the Gaza area” but that they were blurry and he could not be sure whether the people were Thais."
431,431,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/world/middleeast/netanyahu-dermer-israel-war.html,"Several of Mr. Biden’s top advisers, including Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, worked for Mr. Obama and have vivid memories of Israel’s lobbying campaign against the Iran deal.

Mr. Dermer brushed aside the battles of the past as “totally irrelevant” to his relationships with the administration today. “I don’t see it as a cloud hanging over anything,” he said in a telephone interview on Monday.

Iran, he noted, has receded as a bone of contention between the United States and Israel. Mr. Biden’s attempts to revive the nuclear talks have faded, and Hamas, which led the deadly Oct. 7 assault on Israeli civilians and soldiers, is backed by the Iranians. The president sent aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Iran and its Lebanese proxy group, Hezbollah, from entering the war against Israel.

“I don’t think the coordination and cooperation has ever been better, certainly not in a time of war,” Mr. Dermer said. “They understand where we are; we understand where they are.”

That was not the case during the Obama years. In 2014, during a previous Israeli military operation in Gaza, the State Department said it was “appalled” by what it called a “disgraceful” strike on a U.N. school. Israeli officials seethed at the language, which they felt was wholly unjustified.

White House aides also fumed that Mr. Dermer tilted consistently toward the Republicans, who are more favorable to Mr. Netanyahu and his positions. Mr. Dermer had much warmer relations with President Donald J. Trump, who withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, did not object to the Israeli settlements, proposed Israeli annexation of large parts of the West Bank and moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, as Israel had long requested.

Mr. Dermer, analysts said, has a sophisticated grasp of how the war is complicating domestic politics for Mr. Biden, with progressive Democrats and Muslim and Arab American voters balking at his embrace of Israel. Given Mr. Dermer’s close ties to Mr. Trump, who is running again for president, some question whether he would counsel Mr. Netanyahu to take Mr. Biden’s sensitivities into account.

“The administration has to look at Dermer as a double-edged sword,” Mr. Miller said. “On the one hand, they have a very high-level conduit to the prime minister. On the other hand, he has a demonstrated capacity of behaving in a way that doesn’t acknowledge reciprocity between the United States and Israel.”

At one level, Mr. Dermer’s membership in the war cabinet is surprising. Born and raised in Miami Beach, he moved to Israel after graduate school and did not serve in the Israeli military. Three of the cabinet members are retired generals, while Mr. Netanyahu served in a special forces unit as a young soldier.

But on another level, it is predictable, given Mr. Dermer’s longstanding ties to Mr. Netanyahu, who is widely known as Bibi. He has advised the prime minister since 2000, whether from Washington or Jerusalem, and is viewed as his alter ago — or, as the Jewish online magazine Tablet once memorably put it, “Bibi’s Brain.”

“He made sure Dermer was a part of” the war cabinet, said Anshel Pfeffer, who wrote a biography, “Bibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu.” He added, “It’s telling that the only person he trusts on it is Ron Dermer, who has little or no military experience.”

As ambassador from 2013 to 2021, Mr. Dermer was an influential player in Washington, not only in diplomatic circles but also in political ones. He cultivated lawmakers on Capitol Hill, especially Republicans, working with them to arrange a speech to a joint session of Congress by Mr. Netanyahu in 2015, during which he branded Mr. Obama’s proposed nuclear agreement a “very bad deal.”

Mr. Dermer later worked closely with Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, on the Abraham Accords, which normalized Israeli relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. That deal prioritized Israel’s relations with its Arab neighbors over a two-state settlement with the Palestinians.

“He’s the ultimate plenipotentiary guy,” said Michael B. Oren, who preceded Mr. Dermer as Israel’s ambassador, using the diplomatic term for an envoy invested with full authority to act on his government’s behalf abroad."

Before there can be any kind of stable coexistence of peoples in Israel and Palestine, there’s going to have to be a stable coexistence of narratives. There’s a line I love from Yossi Klein Halevi’s book, “Letters to My Palestinian Neighbor,” where he writes, quote, “We must recognize not only each other’s right to self-determination but also each side’s right to self-definition.” So you can think of the episodes this week as a matched pair. You could think of it as one episode in two parts. But one is going to be on this moment and the background to it through Palestinian eyes and the other on this moment and the background to it through Israeli eyes. Obviously nobody can speak for a whole people. These are just what they claim to be — historically and journalistically informed perspectives. There are many more. I didn’t find everything in these conversations easy to hear. I doubt you will either. I didn’t agree with everything I heard and I doubt you will either. But that’s not the spirit in which I’m trying to do these. The point, at least for me, is to simply try and hold these perspectives at the same time because somehow this land, this cursed, sacred, bloody scar of land, is going to have to hold them and more.

amjad iraqi

Thanks so much for having me.

ezra klein

So I wanted to begin with what Gaza looked like before the attack on Oct. 7. And I want to, I guess, begin with a more simple question, which is, what was Gaza?

amjad iraqi

I mean, Gaza, as we know it today, is almost like an imaginary construct. Historically, there was Gaza City. It wasn’t a strip. It was a part of what was regarded as historical Palestine that, through different empires and rulers over the years was this kind of coastal area, which was also one of the port cities and had these other rural areas around it, and was very much one of the major points of Palestinian Arab history in that land. This all naturally changed in 1948 with regard to the Arab-Israeli war, or what Palestinians refer to as the Nakba, or the catastrophe. And whereby after that war, you had Palestine split apart by armistice lines that were created between the newfound Israeli state and the Arab states around it. And at the time, Gaza was then put onto the Egyptian side. And that formulated that slot of land that we know of today and its shape. Most of the population since 1948 have been refugees or descendants of Palestinian refugees who either fled or were expelled during that 1948 war. And a lot of these people can literally see the lands from which their families came from just a few kilometers or miles away. And even to this day those descendants are still living in what I regard as refugee camps, which now look like permanent settlements in a way, like permanent communities or towns and villages. But they still strongly identify themselves as refugees. I think something like two-thirds of the Gaza Strip’s population are technically not from that area. And Gaza has always been very much at the center of — or one of the pillars of Palestinian identity, of Palestinian memory of the region. And certainly in terms of politics and identity and resistance, Gaza has always been very much at the front in many ways of initiating that, of producing Palestinians who created different kinds of politics and so on. I’m emphasizing this especially because there’s become this tendency to think of the Gaza Strip as something separate from Palestine and something separate from the Palestinian people in history. But it’s really vital to understand how central it is to it. Now, all this has very much been, let’s say, deformed after the 1967 occupation, and even more so since the blockade of the Gaza Strip in 2007, whereby the Gaza that we see today is one that is completely encaged by a blockade that was initiated after the Islamist movement Hamas took over the strip, which itself came after Hamas won Democratic elections to the Palestinian government, which was then met by international sanctions led by the Bush administration and then a Western backed coup by the rival party Fatah, which is led by Mahmoud Abbas and governs the West Bank. And that blockade has basically been de-developed since 2007. So the infrastructure and the towns’ and communities’ access to basic services have been crippling along the way because of the blockade and its restrictions on movement, on people, on goods, and really formulating this cage, and in a very deliberate policy to try to separate Gaza and Hamas, but especially Gaza as a unit, away from the Palestinian people.

ezra klein

So I want to zoom in on two periods here. And the first is when Gaza moves from Egyptian control to Israeli control, because I think it’s also important for people to realize that Gaza is somewhat — it’s almost comanaged between Egypt and Israel, even now. So what happens in that moment? How does Gaza go from being something that Egypt has authority over to something that Israel is now controlling?

amjad iraqi

So in June 1967, you had the Six-Day War between Israel and surrounding Arab states. And within the space of a week, Israel had basically conquered the West Bank from Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and then the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt. And this was quite a shocking victory on Israel’s end. Later on, the Sinai was eventually ceded back in the negotiations with Anwar Sadat, the president of Egypt in the ‘70s. This was the Camp David Accords. And for Egypt and Israel — and there’s been some fantastic research about this — but just explaining how the armistice line was then redrawn to the Gaza Strip. And so this is how you formulated that agreement between Israel and Egypt that Gaza’s future lay with the Palestinian people, not with Egypt.

ezra klein

You mentioned this research about how Gaza becomes seen as something that’s not going to, in some kind of deal, go back to Egypt, but becomes part of Palestine. And so it becomes a sort of — I don’t want to call it unwanted, but Egypt also does not end up wanting to control Gaza. What is that research? What is the narrative of that?

amjad iraqi

I mean, the huge part of the Palestinian question, especially on the Israeli side, is to try to make the Palestinian issue an Arab problem. So it was always about trying to cast it off to the Arab states, even hoping, like in the West Bank, that Jordan would just take all the Palestinians and that would be done with it. But the Palestinians themselves, from the very get-go, have always resisted this kind of geopolitical game that’s been played with them. Even Arab states, which have always had their own agendas and larger visions of the regional architecture, still understood, especially both by the Palestinians who were resisting on the ground, but also a lot of the Arab publics, which to this day are still heavily sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, that the Palestinians needed to be able to assert themselves in their own homeland, that their struggle lay with the future in their land and not just to be dispersed and diluted into this Arab region. So after the trauma of the Nakba, that became, basically from the ‘60s, that Palestinians were really taking a much more concerted, organized agency in order to make the world not forget them, like after 1948. That it wasn’t just a done deal and that Palestinians weren’t going to be silenced in that respect or just melt away into the region. That they still had aspirations for their own homeland. So Palestinians themselves made it impossible for these other Arab capitals and for the Israeli state to completely ignore them. But for a whole host of reasons, it did not go the way that at least Palestinians have been hoping to.

ezra klein

So go back to 2006 here. There are elections held in Gaza. To some degree, one of the big movers here is the Bush administration — over the objections of some, who they really want elections — Hamas wins the election. What is Hamas? And what is Hamas at that point? And why do they win?

amjad iraqi

So Hamas is like a Palestinian Islamist movement. And those two need to be combined because there’s a tendency to just dismiss it as another one of these Islamist groups that has these grand Islamic caliphate visions for the region. But Hamas has always been very concerted about defining itself as a particularly national movement for the Palestinians. And yes, it has connections to other Islamists. It has a history with the Muslim Brotherhood, for example. And obviously tied in with a lot of Arab capitals and even Iran, for example. But its goal is very much focused on Palestine. And so it originated basically almost like a social movement, I think back in the ‘70s or even ‘80s. The early incarnations of it was recognized as an N.G.O. even by the Israeli occupation authorities. And then, through a couple of processes, you end up having Hamas emerging out, especially out of the First Intifada in the late ‘80s, seeing itself as like a religious political model or political Islamist model, and one especially that was grounded in historic Palestine itself, in the occupied territories, which was different from the P.L.O., which was very much born in exile and by the refugees abroad. And in addition to that political Islam, there were also trying to create this challenge to the P.L.O., which they were seeing as shifting its politics as we would eventually see with Yasir Arafat moving towards recognition of the two state solution, the signing of the Oslo Accords, the renouncing of armed struggle. And Hamas has always been very insistent that in addition to its political agenda, that armed struggle needs to be an integral part of Palestinian resistance. So this is what really set it apart or tried to define itself as being set apart from the Fatah party which governed the P.L.O. And it’s evolved over the years. And it’s a very complex organization. And Tareq Baconi wrote a really fantastic book about this, called “Hamas Contained,” where he really provides a very great complex analysis of how it was born and fantastic details. And it’s important not to think of it as a monolith, whether you approve of the movement or not. It has a political bureau. It has armed wings. And it has these debates and these mechanisms that revolve around it. Hamas really defined itself in the ‘90s with this military struggle, especially of the suicide bombings which became notorious, including during the Second Intifada. But then in the 2005, 2006 elections, it became this test to see, OK, what if we try to use these Democratic models? What if we focus on the political rather than the armed struggle and try to really center ourselves at the center of the Palestinian national movement? Not just to have Fatah or the P.L.O. dominate, but to be able to really reflect these other political ideas. So it sees itself as trying to become part of this wider spectrum. But the response has just been complete blockage by Fatah, which still sees itself as almost like the sole leader, the sole monopolist of Palestinian politics, at the time by international actors, which especially under the rubric of the war on terror, was almost refusing to have any conversations with political Islamist movements, let alone ones that maintained an armed struggle. And for Hamas’s experience, the fact that they participated in elections, won the parliament, and then were sanctioned and then basically ousted from government is for them an indication that they cannot let go of armed struggle. And this is why they very much — unlike Fatah and the P.L.O. — they’re still holding on to it. And that’s one of the things that has also helped it to maintain a certain status in Palestinian society, where even those who disagree with Hamas ideologically or in political moves feel that Hamas is still one of the only movements that are still incurring a cost on the Israeli occupation in a way that Fatah no longer is or that the P.L.O. no longer is.

So two things in there that I want to go into in more detail. So one, after Hamas wins, there’s a blockade imposed by Israel. The blockade is also enforced by Egypt, by international actors. And there’s this war that happens with Fatah. Can you talk a bit about both what the blockade is and also why Egypt participates in it. And then also the war with Fatah, what happens there?

amjad iraqi

So you have the 2005 election, which gets Mahmoud Abbas as president and then the 2006 one where Hamas wins the legislature. And it was very clear from the outset that neither Fatah nor its Western sponsors were going to be accepting of this scenario. That even though Hamas was playing the political game as demanded, the very fact that they could have such popular support and win even by the rules of the game was just unacceptable. And so in the months that ensued afterwards, you basically had constant tensions. The sanctions that were imposed by the European Union, by the Bush administration just made it impossible for Hamas to even function in government. It became almost designed to fail. And all this ended up happening whereby both Fatah and Hamas with their different security forces or armed groups ended up almost fighting out into the streets, especially in Gaza, and Hamas won that battle. And then this kind of gave the pretext for Israel to completely enforce this full-on siege. We’re talking about severe restrictions at the border crossings, both in terms of making almost impossible for people to get in and out. And this is in addition to just general goods and just basic trade. Gaza used to be part and parcel of the economy of the West Bank. And also inside Israel, during the Oslo period, people used to be able to go in and out of Gaza. And in the moment that blockade — and even just the months and years before, like when the closure started being in place — it became this highly isolated territorial island in a way. And for Palestinians in Gaza who’ve been experiencing the siege, we’re talking about an entire generation who’ve never been out of that strip and who’ve never seen another Palestinian from the West Bank, who only know Israelis through the tanks and the fighter jets and the Israeli snipers at the border. This is the harrowing reality. And with each passing year, and especially as the military assaults kept bombarding Gaza, it wasn’t able to even reconstruct or even — again, for young Palestinians, especially to even envision a future outside of this cage in which they’re born in. So this is the very harrowing reality that Israel, especially, has specifically designed. And for Egypt, Egypt’s presidency, whether it was Mubarak or Sisi today, and with the gap of the Muslim Brotherhood in the middle, they despise political Islamists. They themselves are trying to fight them back in Egyptian territory, including in the Sinai. So they are no friends of Hamas. And for all the lip service that Egypt also provides for the Palestinian cause, they also have geopolitical interests. And they’re more interested in the alliance with Israel in many respects and especially the backing of the United States compared to really assisting the Palestinian people. And it fluctuates. And sometimes the presidents have — like Sisi now is concerned about how the Egyptian public will respond to what’s happening right now. But these are the complex games where Palestinians are kind of — especially those in Gaza — are really just kept hostage by the geopolitical games.

ezra klein

So one thing I want to be attentive to in this conversation is the way the narratives and the experiences behind those narratives conflict. And so I think the dominant Israeli narrative, it’s fair to say, is something like, in ‘05, Israel withdraws from Gaza. Gazans choose Hamas. Palestinians more broadly in ‘06 choose Hamas for parliament, but it ends up being in Gaza where that is sustained. Hamas is an organization that is an existential security threat to Israel. The organization, as you say, known for the suicide bombings, which are a generational trauma for Israelis. And so Gaza needs to be treated as a kind of hostile space, an existential threat. So that, I think, is the way Israelis see it, or at least Jewish Israelis see it. What is the dominant Palestinian narrative here? I recognize that might overlap with some things you’ve said, but I just want to try to put it in one place.

amjad iraqi

I mean, it’s a convenient narrative for Israelis to center it around Hamas and to center it around terrorism. But the Gaza Strip existed before Hamas was established in the ‘80. Right now in the Israeli mind-set, that conflation or that excuse of using an armed political group to be able to decimate an entire society, I think really needs to be broken down. And a lot of people abroad, sadly, are buying into it. And just to put this into context as well, you have, let’s say, kind of three streams or models in which politics can be waged that we’re seeing right now. So you have Hamas, which is stuck with armed struggle, armed violence, or, quote unquote, “terrorism” as is defined abroad by Israel. You have Fatah, which especially since the Oslo Accords and under Mahmoud Abbas’s reign has focused on leading the political struggle through diplomacy, through going to the U.N., going to the I.C.C., focusing on these international forums, all while still keeping to the provisions of the Oslo Accords, like security coordination with the Israeli military, keeping its end of the bargain by playing that game. But what they’re finding is that even that is now being defined as diplomatic terrorism. That even the P.A.‘s model is actually basically roundly dismissed, is roundly demonized, and you still have the same occupation — not even the same, it’s even an entrenching occupation. And that the P.A. has now become this convenient subcontractor to this regime in the West Bank. And then you have, let’s say, a third model of Palestinian politics of like the boycott divestment and sanctions. Using literally the nonviolent methods that all of us were taught are the best way to go, are very moral and righteous, and that is coercion without the same kind of coercion of armed struggle. And what Palestinians are finding is that when you practice that, you’re demonized also as terrorists and demonized, even worse, as anti-Semites because you’re using a nonviolent method to try to achieve your rights and to try to weaken the structures that allow the Israeli occupation to take place. Now, if all of these are defined as unacceptable, not just by Israel, but by — and especially in a lot of Western countries which are criminalizing boycotts, and they’re not giving Fatah and the P.A. the diplomatic victories or providing them anything beyond just money to supply to the Palestinians, and at the same time they’re violently going against Hamas. Palestinians are saying, so what options do we have left? And the only thing that has actually ever really incurred that cost is Hamas’s armed struggle. This is one of the perspectives that’s very much in the public’s mind. And even though the cost of that is borne on Palestinians, it’s like are we going to wait for a slow annihilation or a quick one? Are we going to put up a fight or are we not going to put up a fight? So these are the kind of debates that are happening right now. And Hamas is very conscious of this. As I said, they tried to play the political game back in 2005 and ‘06. And what they experienced was a complete rebuttal. They even tried, for example, the great March of Return and facilitating this march that happened back in 2018, that went on to 2019, to try to push against the Gaza fence in this massive civil disobedience, in this massive march of really hundreds of thousands of people. And Israeli snipers either killed or maimed hundreds and injured thousands of Palestinians. And the world just sat by and again defined it as terrorists. So Hamas is also navigating all this and examining it. And it’s making its judgments based on that, that nothing is actually working. And for Palestinians now as well, in the wider public, like I said, even those who disagree with the movement or its decisions, but they’re asking themselves, like, well, what do we have left? And what Palestinians are realizing is that it’s not about the method. It is our very existence that is deemed unacceptable by the Israelis, and by a lot of Western powers and people who support them who see us as disposable and Jewish Israelis as the ones who need to be protected and whose rights need to be met first.

ezra klein

There’s also a more complicated reality than emerges than I think in the Israeli narrative between Israel itself and Hamas. You’ve talked about your colleague Tareq Baconi’s idea of the violent equilibrium that emerges. What is the violent equilibrium?

amjad iraqi

The equilibrium as Tareq describes it is this almost de facto arrangement that was established whereby Hamas and Israel understood that they were going to get into regular confrontations, like armed military confrontations. And that this was almost a form of communication. When, for example, the blockade became a bit too untenable, when there were Israeli domestic political issues, that armed violence would be the ways that they renegotiate some of the conditions of the blockade. But that on the whole, the idea was that every now and then they will negotiate in this tactic, but that the, quote unquote, “calm” is what would become the status quo. But this itself was kind of a myth — this idea of calm. Because for the Israelis, they experienced, for the most part, calm. And from the North to the South, most Israelis were able to go about their lives. But in Gaza, the siege is the constant. The structural violence of besiegement is the constant. In the Israeli mind-set, this equilibrium was fantastic because they just almost pretended as if Gaza was just static. And they began to believe that actually this kind of de facto arrangement could last forever, that they didn’t need to come up with some alternative solution, that this itself was a solution. And this is where it’s also very much connected to the way that the occupation is managed in the West Bank where you have this kind of subcontractor in the P.A. that they just govern a few things in the population centers, but it’s the Israeli state that controls everything. So it became like an integral part of this maintenance of an apartheid regime in the same way that we would understand the Bantustans and apartheid in South Africa or elsewhere. But that equilibrium was always very shaky. That equilibrium always came at the cost of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip in their daily life and certainly during those bouts of military violence. And Oct. 7, I think, has very much erased that equilibrium. It’s very much erased that arrangement. That Hamas, for whatever reasons, could no longer hold it up. And it has also shocked the Israeli system to understand that something else has to replace it. But unfortunately, what we’re seeing now is something even worse in that regard.

ezra klein

What I find useful about the idea of the equilibrium is it gets at, I think, a more complicated reality here, which is that the two sides are in relationship, and what they do affects the other. And there are two quotes that stick in my mind here. So Netanyahu is widely reported to have said at a Likud meeting when he is asked about allowing Qatari money to go to Hamas, he says, quote, “Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state must support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas.” He goes on to say it’s part of our strategy. And then Bezalel Smotrich, who is now the finance minister in Netanyahu’s government and has a lot of control over the West Bank, in 2015, he says, “The Palestinian Authority is a burden. Hamas is an asset.” One reason I think that’s important is that the relationship between the Israeli government and Hamas becomes more complicated than simple enmity. Is there a way that both sides are benefiting from each other prior to the major attacks?

amjad iraqi

I think they all benefited in many respects. And even though those benefits came at a massive asymmetry, but everyone had something to gain from the, quote unquote, “status quo.” For someone like Smotrich, the P.A. is this very frustrating partner. The fact that even though they’re almost on an Israeli payroll, but they can still go to these diplomatic forums, et cetera, and say all these things about Israel. And for Smotrich, it’s just infuriating. But especially when he’s come into power, he’s realizing how useful they are because they’re actually keeping a hold, for the most part, on the Palestinian people, such that the Israeli army doesn’t have to do it. It’s like a partner that you need, but one they have to allow to launch these kind of diplomatic offensives against the state. Hamas is just a nice pure and simple in the Israeli establishment. It is the embodiment of an evil. It is a clear cut enemy that you can basically inflict all the violence that you want upon it. You can’t really do that with the P.A. They know that Fatah always needs it. And they just find the right equilibrium in that respect to keep the P.A. alive and to keep it functioning because the P.A. is so dependent. And this is why even to this day, the Fatah leadership can’t exist outside of the structure of the occupation right now. And for Hamas, the Gaza Strip allowed it to become almost like a fiefdom of its own, that it gave it some sense of power. And that it was able to create this kind of more sturdy base for it to establish itself, to establish its armed wing more, and to try to tackle the occupation with more control than it otherwise would have. So that arrangement worked for them in that respect. And this is kind of the irony, again, of even a group like Hamas, which for all its talk of resistance also appreciated the status quo in many respects. And all of this fed into this divide and conquer strategy. It’s your typical story of that for the Israelis this was a great way to keep the Palestinian leadership divided, to have them each have those separate fiefdoms, and to try to entrench the idea that the West Bank is separate from Gaza, even in the minds of Palestinians. And that the Israelis could manage all this from above. So yeah, everyone stood to gain for it. And this is what created the, quote unquote, “calm,” especially for Israeli-Jewish society. And the violence that was inflicted on Palestinians on a regular basis, including against Gaza with massive wars, even despite occasional rocket attacks or even militant attacks in Israeli cities, that was kind of seen as both physically and psychologically distant for the Israeli state and for most Jewish-Israelis. It was very much part of a doctrine, especially led by Netanyahu, to really erase the occupation from the Israeli mind-set. Out of sight and out of mind. And I think a lot of people just assumed that this could be sustainable. But again, what happened on Oct. 7, I think showed the folly of that. And this is never something static. That even though Palestinian elites can sometimes gain from the system, in the end, the Palestinian public, with the pressures that they’re putting on their leaderships, both Hamas and Fatah, and just making the occupation itself untenable, I think is proof that apartheid can’t work forever like this. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

There has been this overwhelming sense that what Israel suffered on Oct. 7, among other things, was an intelligence failure. But the more I see the reporting on this, the more that doesn’t actually seem right to me. They had actually a lot of intelligence. They saw a lot of the training happening in open air. What they had was a political analysis failure. They believed that Hamas was relatively comfortable in the position it was in, that it was not going to want to risk this kind of war with Israel. They did not think Hamas would do something like this. Not that they didn’t see them preparing for it, but they didn’t believe that they would want to upend the equilibrium in the way they did. So at this point, what is your sense of what they wanted? Why didn’t Hamas just want to stay in the position they were in where Israel was not trying to destroy it root and branch?

amjad iraqi

I mean, you hit at something very important here, whereby even beyond political analysis, there’s a deeper psychology that has really taken hold of the Israeli political and military establishment and Israeli society, which, like I said, that they thought that this could keep going forever. They couldn’t imagine that Hamas wanted anything differently. And that, yes, aside from your occasional confrontations, the idea of Gaza being out of sight, out of mind is actually became the norm. And so, yeah, I think for them, as much as it was a military shock, it was a psychological shock, a barrier really being broken by the fact that Hamas told the Israelis, in very violent fashion, we no longer want this to be the case. Now, as to why Hamas decided to pick this moment and even these methods, there are multiple layers of this. In the end, it’s not just about Gaza. It’s about the wider Palestinian question. You’ve been seeing not just in the past years, but even just in the past months, just for a smaller scope, under this Israeli far-right government, which has been very explicit about what it wants to do to the occupied territories, especially in the West Bank, of full-force annexation, a judicial coup which is very much designed and seen as a phase towards the full absorption of the West Bank, a very unabashed envisioning of expelling as many Palestinians as possible, especially by people like Smotrich and Ben-Gvir. They’re seeing — even before this month, you had West Bank communities, rural ones and villages, who are being chased out by escalating settler violence, all backed up by the army. And all this is happening at the same time that you have Arab states, including the expectation that Saudi Arabia was going to be joining on to the Abraham Accords and really taking one of the last pieces of regional leverage that the Palestinian cause still had. And this is in addition to local pressures of Palestinians in Gaza who, especially in the past few months, under this total blockade are still demanding of Hamas as the de facto government to provide more support for basic services, especially with electricity, which is almost impossible to meet in conditions of siege, but that they were still turning to the Hamas government to provide for that in some form or another. So you have these local and national and regional factors, which could not make the status quo last any longer. And even though obviously this military operation, these assaults were planned well in advance and took a lot of intelligence gathering, et cetera, it’s enwrapped very much in the fact that the Palestinian question and Palestinians were under — increasingly under an existential threat. We’re experiencing it in a very expedited form now, but this was happening for months and years on end. And so I think for a group like Hamas — I mean, I can’t speak for it. But I think they made the calculation that something had to give because Hamas could no longer survive as a local government and the Palestinian cause could no longer survive under this far-right government. It could no longer survive if all the Arab governments were turning away from it.

ezra klein

What is Hamas’s sense of Israel’s psychology, and, in particular, its relationship to loss? And I think this is an uncomfortable thing to talk about. But I do think it needs to be part of trying to figure out what happened here. So Nathan Thrall, who was the lead International Crisis Group analyst on the region. He wrote a book some number of years ago, called “The Only Language You Understand,” arguing that both Israelis and Palestinians tend to make their concessions under the threat of force. You’ve done interviews and work around moments when fighting erupts between Hamas and Israel and the sense that Hamas actually often does get concessions in those moments. Hamas got a lot out of a prisoner exchange not too long ago under Netanyahu. And many people think that was part of their incentive to take many more civilian hostages this time, and, of course, military hostages, in the hopes of winning a lot of people back in another prisoner exchange. How much do you think that Hamas thought this would actually get it concessions versus how much do you think it understood that it was going to bring down a hellacious war?

amjad iraqi

To be honest, it’s really hard to say. And I’ve been talking with a lot of people of exactly what Hamas thought It was going to get out of this. And there are two elements to this operation as well. One side of it is the military nature of it, of like breaking out of the fence, of attacking military targets. This was kind of like the first phase of what happened on Oct. 7 in the morning hours of that. And this is what Palestinians really have been mostly looking to as just that the group had the capacity to actually break out of this cage and that they could actually completely humiliate the Israeli military, that it wasn’t as invincible as everyone was making it out to be, and that there was a way to shatter out of it. But then that second side of that, of course, are these horrific massacres that happened in the Southern communities. I mean, I can’t speak to how much they were directed. I can’t speak to how much was not just the question of a fog of war, but also the rage of war that these militants also launched some of the massacres that they did like that. We’ll only get to know this in the coming weeks, months, and years as we investigate this more. But it’s just unclear entirely what it was. Or were they just trying to play a certain card just to say just change something, just change anything out of the equilibrium. Did they have a more concerted plan in coordination with groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon hoping that that would serve enough deterrence? There’s no way Hamas did this thinking that the Israelis were not going to respond so viciously. And we’re not sure how much they thought they could get away with in the military assault in the first place. And so there’s just so much uncertainty. And we’re still in that fog as we speak. So I really can’t speak to it. And even now we’re hearing different conflicting things sometimes from members of the Hamas movement, and from the political bureau, from the armed wing, from the people in Gaza versus people outside. So it’s been very messy to see all this. But in many respects, putting aside all these questions, there’s no doubt that I think Hamas, for the better and the worse, has really thrown everyone in the region back onto the Palestinian question at a time where it was really being marginalized. Hamas has very violently forced all the Arab states to rethink their alliances with Israel and to realize that the Palestinians still have political cards to play even when done in such brutal fashion. And it’s been very complex to navigate their full calculations about this. But I think even just the very idea to show the Israelis that you can no longer go on this, I think for Hamas was also an important message to send.

ezra klein

Yeah, I have really struggled with whether or not I even want to talk about this question. But I feel very uncomfortable, and in some ways, as somebody who covered more in this region 15 years ago, 10 years ago than I do now, somewhat personally ashamed by something that you just gestured at, which is that there were big efforts to draw attention to the conditions that Palestinians would live under, the “March of Return,” various things in the divestment movement. There have been other efforts. Abbas has given big speeches at the U.N. And the savagery of Hamas’s attacks seems to have worked in the sense of focusing a lot more attention on the lived experience of Palestinians. And I think that needs to make a lot of us who care about this conflict wonder about our own behavior over the past 10, 15 years. I don’t think that it absolves or justifies or excuses anything Hamas did, which is why this is difficult to talk about. But I think that it casts a much more negative light on things that we weren’t doing before.

amjad iraqi

Yeah. And this is really an absolutely vital question. And just putting aside even just the questions of the immoralities that we’ve been seeing, not just by Hamas but also what is being inflicted now in Gaza by the Israeli state and the army, I mean this comes back to what I was saying earlier whereby Palestinians have tried everything really. They’ve picked up their guns. They picked up their pens. They picked up their banners. Everything you can think of, Palestines have tried. And it’s not an exaggeration to say how much Palestinians feel that they’ve been duped by the lessons of history, the international community, which even in governments that claim to support their rights and claimed to be on their side in some form or another. And what they’re experiencing is that it doesn’t matter what they do, the very fact that they’re Palestinian, the very fact that they are the biggest thorn in a state that is desperately trying to make itself out as a, quote unquote, “Jewish and democratic state” is in reality not interested in their existence, whether it’s in physical presence, not in their identity, and that their very existence as Palestinian Arabs is itself a threat. And when we look at foreign governments, but also the media and the public and where they’ve all just demonized anything and everything that Palestinians do. And that’s become very clear that Jewish-Israelis matter more in much of the Western world, especially. I think in the global south, there’s a very different understanding of this. But Israel thrives off and is very much propped up by political, military, economic arrangements by what still remains one of the foremost global superpower and European states that have such a hold to enable Israel to do this with such impunity. And so, yeah, I think these questions really need to be asked by the world. How much has, especially Western publics and Western governments facilitated that? Not just facilitated the apartheid on the ground, but the apartheid in the mind. That how much do we actually put Jewish-Israeli rights first before Palestinians? How disposable are Palestinians compared to Jewish-Israelis? I’m not saying just to say flip it. It needs to be rectified to understand Palestinians as humans.

ezra klein

The cost of this attention is that Hamas has incurred an overwhelming Israeli reprisal, and predictably so, against Gazans, and possibly — we’ll see what happens in the West Bank — it could spread from there. Many, many, many people are dying. Many, many, many people are losing their homes. What trends, what tendencies do you see in the way Hamas’s attack is now seen by Palestinians in the Gaza or in the West Bank? How do they understand what Hamas did?

amjad iraqi

I mean, it’s also been hard to gauge. Palestinians, in a way, don’t even have time to reflect on it, especially in Gaza. They’re focused on survival. There was no time to even process what had happened on Oct. 7 before the bombs started falling. And even in the West Bank, you’re seeing a massive escalation in military settler violence. And so they’re seeing the kind of immediate aftermath of that. And even inside Israel, Palestinian citizens, who make up a fifth of the Israeli citizenry, are also just in a total paralyzing fear from Jewish-Israeli society, from the police, from Israeli institutions. And the thing is we’ve seen these trends before. Even those who maybe disagreed with Hamas or even found the massacres to be morally abhorrent, they still understand why Hamas is still keeping to military struggle. And that even if they disagree with it, they understand the context behind it. And this is a big difference between — you don’t have to defend it, but you need to understand why it’s the case. You need to understand why political violence, even murderous violence, is used in such contexts. I know this is a very delicate subject and many people might be immediately outraged by it. But it can’t be that the way we’ve spent trying to understand the logic or even just the ideas behind such political violence in other contexts, somehow all of that is erased when it comes to the Palestinians. And so in the community, I think if there’s ever a space, that there’s going to be huge debates. And there are debates, whether it’s in private living rooms or whether it’s in forums, Palestinian citizens have a bit more of Israel, have a bit more ability to even debate this, about the question, again, of armed struggle and what’s been going on now. But everyone is in such survival mode because the state and society has really turned on them that it’s been hard to really gauge what everyone’s reflecting on this. But what we do know is just the fact that everyone could expect such wanton violence from the Israeli state, especially in regards to Gaza, the fact that everyone could predict that there was Israeli settler and state violence in huge parts of the occupied West Bank, that still needs to be part of the conversation. OK, you were talking about a piece of violence that happened on Oct. 7. What about the daily violence that happened before? What about the daily violence that happened afterwards? And if that’s still being ignored, then for Palestinians it’s that sense that we’re on our own. That at least someone is exposing to people that the violence is there, whether or not you’re actually attentive to it. The violence is there even when Jewish-Israelis are not being killed or massacred. So this for Palestinians is still that dominant thought.

ezra klein

There’s a tendency when you want to talk about how this could be better to move to the question of state-based frameworks — two states, one states, big picture settlements. You’ve been pretty critical of the tendency to talk about this in terms of state-based solutions. Tell me why.

amjad iraqi

I think one of the biggest lessons I take from the height of the decolonization of the era over the past century is how much the state, first of all, it entraps political struggles in many respects, or how much of a fake identity it is in many respects, that it really limits and disrupts our understanding of history, of how societies live and exist, and can organize themselves outside of these very arbitrary borders. And they are, in the end, arbitrary. Even historical Palestine was once integrated into the region. And yes, you had the idea of provinces and you had different kind of regional identities. There was a much more fluid construct of identity that existed. But then I think also the part of the era of the anticolonial period was that for them nationalism became the engine for your liberation. And that itself is still very exclusionary. The idea that you need to have these very rigid borders is still very exclusionary. And I think we can be better than that. And it’s a bit of a tragedy that Palestine is still one of those kind of — it’s a struggle that’s very much out of its place. It’s like 19th century ideologies and a 20th century conflict in a 21st century world. And even though we’re seeing these kind of resurgences of nationalisms and state borders and all these aspects, there are ways to imagine something differently. And I worry that the Palestinian struggle and Palestinianess and Palestinian identity has been so enwrapped in Arab nationalism that I think we can look back to our own history and our own literature to remind ourselves that there’s something broader. What are local identities? Like in Palestine, whether you’re from Nablus, or from Gaza, or from Haifa, the local identities were a huge part of our daily existence. And so there’s something about statehood and nationalism which kind of erases that a lot of times. And people know this in America. People know this all over the world. It misguides us by just asserting ourselves in the national state identity. And this for me is also the case in Israel and Palestine. And Zionism in that respect — political Zionism — is also for me that kind of archaic idea whereby they can only envision Jewish safety with this hypermilitarized powerful state. And that it needs to be exclusionary. And that Palestine needs to be only for one people, for the Jewish people. And that itself is ethnocentric. That itself is what facilitates apartheid. And so I don’t think the answer to imagining something outside of Zionism, as manifested today, needs to be another kind of nationalism. It could be a state that could be broken down more. What is Jewish existence outside of the state of Israel? Outside in terms of the land, but away from those constructs. And to reorganize ourselves and rethink our identities in different ways. So how do you reflect the people on the ground? Israeli society itself — Jewish-Israelis will tell you first and foremost that they can hardly sometimes find the things that really unite them. Jewish-Israeli society is just as diverse as any other. Life in Tel Aviv is nothing like life in Jerusalem or life in the South or in the North, in the same way that for Palestinians as well. It’s a massive diversity. So how do you reflect that diversity by actually reflecting the people on the ground and not some political idea that tries to pretend that we’re on the same page in this one single territory that needs to be cut off from everybody else? How do we envision a more decentralized model of existence? How do we think about regions? How do we think about cities as leading our political and economic ways of life? I’m only vaguely scratching the surfaces and there are people who have done a lot of amazing work on this. But I just don’t want us to be trapped by these ideas which we can see in every part of the world it ended up becoming its own oppressive system on its own people. So I want us to break out of that. But if the answer to that is not only that we get attacked for doing so, we’re even called anti-Semites because we’re actually envisioning something that’s not a Jewish state. But especially in the Western world, where if I say I want a state for all its citizens or I want a land for all its inhabitants and the response is that you’re asking for the destruction of the Jewish people, I don’t have the space to even imagine that. And I’m being demonized for doing so. So I think trying to provide the legitimate spaces for Palestinians to think about that, and to say why Zionism is a problem, and to say that we can imagine something outside of nationalism and statehood, I think is much more realistic to who we are, much more realistic to the future that we want and to create something much better. [MUSIC PLAYING]

I want to go back to the question of equilibriums, because I found that idea holding in my own mind recently. And I think the reason it has attained a power for me is that what I’m seeing in the media coverage of what’s happening in Israel and Gaza right now, what I’m seeing in my own community, in my own life is the tendency to think in terms of sides when everything is actually an equilibrium. I’ll give an example that’s maybe a little bit personal. I’m Jewish. My natural identification is with Israel. A lot of the people around me are that way too. But the thing that I see happening is that as people experience more anti-Semitism on the left or they see it on social media, it pushes them to a more closed off, scared, and in some ways brutal space. The more scared people get, the more they are willing to countenance in order to restore security. The idea that there’s a static choice — I mean, where they were a month ago is not where they are now. They have changed. The equilibrium has shifted. So you have to think in terms of the ways in which what one side is doing changes the other. And to me what’s true here, or what seems true, is that the thing that is the dominant value on the Israeli side is security. And the dominant demand on the Palestinian side is freedom. Now, it’s not the only demand of either side. But one of the big questions for me in how to think about this as an equilibrium, about how to think about a better equilibrium, is how do you get more security and more freedom as opposed to seeing those two things as zero sum, which is I think how they’re often seen. Where more freedom for Palestinians would mean less security for Israelis because Hamas could plan more attacks. More security for Israelis would mean less freedom for Palestinians because Israel would clamp down on control and surveillance and drones. How do you find more positive sum equilibriums as opposed to thinking about this in terms of which side do you end up on, because it’s not going to be just one side at the end of it all? You have to find some kind of dynamic balance.

amjad iraqi

That’s a tough question. It starts by recognizing that the — you describe as the equilibrium on the larger scale for the better part of the past century has existed and been legitimated on a asymmetric plane. So the equilibrium that we’ve known since Zionism came about is that Zionism got the better part of the equilibrium, where there was great power backing, and being able to fulfill that vision, and even being able to use violence and even international support to legitimate that vision at the expense of Palestinians. And even as we were talking about the idea that the two-state solution is somehow the equilibrium for how to resolve this conflict is it’s not. The two state solution, as we envision it in the past 30 years, especially, is telling Palestinians to accept maybe about a quarter or a fifth of their homeland as their state, not their belonging and their connections, their identity to the wider region. And for Israelis, yes, the idea of security and freedom must come through a powerful state. And not just through a powerful state. It requires ethnoracial supremacy. The tragedy of the Palestinian struggle is that there were a lot of debates and visions to put something different from the ethnocentric model for the future. That our struggle itself also began to think that the equilibrium point is through that. And this is why the P.L.O. acquiesced to the two state solution, acquiesced to Oslo. But I think this young generation of Palestinians are saying — they’re not interested in having just a state with a capital to play the same international game like everyone else. The conversation for them is, am I getting my equal rights? Am I getting the right to return to my homeland? Am I able to live in my land without another society determining how many rights I get to have? As much as we want to try also think about how do we lead this in a positive way, it also requires negative force in a way. That we need to bring the Israeli parameters down and to elevate the Palestinian parameters up in order to create a different kind of equilibrium. That’s the power asymmetry that needs to be dealt with. And I know we’re speaking in a bit of meta and conceptual, but this really manifests in everything. As long as that power asymmetry is still in place, you won’t get a meaningful equilibrium. And Palestinians will always be worse off on it. And so I think this is why Palestinians are so strident about it, whereby the lip service to equality, to human rights, international law, to the self-determination of people, to even refugees being allowed to return, that somehow Palestinians are being asked to waive all that because Jews need their own state with laws and policies that enable Jewish privilege above everybody else. That’s the equilibrium that needs to be shifted. It needs to be redrawn entirely. And I think American Jews and Jews in the diaspora and people abroad have a huge role to play in this. And to not only tell Israelis why an apartheid regime is not the guarantee of your survival, and also to enable Palestinians to say that a vision of real equality and full restoration of everyone’s rights and belonging to the land is what is supported.

ezra klein

Well, I’m an American Jew and a Jew of the diaspora, and the thing that I see when I have this conversation with Israeli friends or sources or people in Israel, the thing that I’m asked, and that I don’t honestly have a good answer to, is that all sounds nice. That all would be great. But that isn’t what Palestinians want. They want us gone. And at times when our politics have been softer, and the peaceniks stronger, and labor stronger, and maybe it wasn’t perfect, and obviously there are claims and counterclaims about every single negotiation that has happened, but there were suicide bombings in cafes and discothèques. And there is no safety for us in equality. That equality can only take place in a context of safety. But when Hamas is a strong force, when there are polls that say armed resistance is the preferred path forward, that there’s no way to move towards that because we will die. And I mean, the fear of annihilation, the fear of eradication lurks deep in the Jewish soul. And that’s not going away and for real reason. And so I’m curious what — not that this is on you to answer, but I’m curious what you would tell me to answer. When they say, that all sounds nice, but the first thing we need to be able to guarantee is that our children aren’t killed. What inequality in a movement towards equality given stated positions and given factions that we really do see allows for that to be also something that makes Jewish-Israelis safer, not less safe?

amjad iraqi

As much as myself and my people come with the cost of this, I understand why Jewish-Israelis have — the way that Zionism has manifested itself, I understand why that’s come about, just psychologically speaking. But if that’s the case, then it begins with being a little bit honest exactly about what the political project is in Israel. That if the lesson of Jewish history, of anti-Semitism, very violent anti-Semitism all the way up to the Holocaust, if the lesson of that — and this is what Zionism kind of began to take hold, especially — that the lesson is to become powerful overlords, then we need to be a bit blunt about that. Beginning with that, Israel actually is not a Democratic state. Israel is not a light unto the nations. Israel is an ethnonationalist colonial project who can only see survival by being ethnonationalist colonial project. And if that’s their decision, that’s their decision. But one of the most infuriating things that everyone’s pretending that Israel is something that it’s not. And what’s been darkly refreshing about this far-right government is that they’ve also been very unapologetic, saying we don’t need to apologize. We do want laws and policies that weed out Palestinians. We do want laws and policies that kick them out of their land. We do want a purely Jewish supremacist state regardless of democracy or vote. The democracy does not matter. And this has been the practice. This has been the experience of Palestinians. If that’s the case, then I think for American Jews, they need to come face to face with that reality and stop kidding themselves that Israel is that democratic model of Jewish self-determination. It’s an apartheid model. And American Jews then need to ask themselves, are those really where their values align? They talk about equality in the United States, but ethnonationalism in Israel-Palestine is that consistent with your values? But if American Jews can’t square that circle, then they need to ask exactly, well, yes, sometimes there is a side. It’s not about being with the Palestinians versus Israelis. It’s about am I on the side of genuine equality for everyone or am I on the side of supremacy?

ezra klein

But see, in a way, I think that was the easy question. And I’ll use myself as the example here. Over the last 10 years, Israel became something that many American Jews could not support. And I think you see that in polling of younger American Jews. I mean, the number who would say that what we were seeing in Israel as an apartheid had gone to levels that would have been unimaginable in the ‘90s. And for a lot of us, as Israeli society chose people like Ben Gvir, as the Netanyahu government moved further and further right, a lot of us disengaged. I mean, it wasn’t a society listening to us. Being Jewish gives me no traction on Israeli politics. And so to say that I don’t support this project, I don’t support what this has become, I mean that in a way was easy. I don’t want to in any way be trying to draw some kind of hopeful picture in the sky here, because I don’t feel hopeful. I do think, though, that there is at least some chance that the failure of that far-right project, the failure of Israel completely embracing an oppressive ethnonationalism, to even provide the one thing that it promised, which was security, possibly reopens the door to something else. Now, that thing could be worse. That thing could be no different. Again, I’m not — I don’t come to politics with a teleological belief that it bends towards justice. Certainly I don’t come to this conflict with that. But I think the question within the question of re-engagement that a lot of us are trying to struggle and understand is that you do need to be able to speak of security. Equality needs to come alongside security, not as a deal — again, this is why I’ve become interested in the language of equilibriums as something that emerges organically from shifting factions, shifting power, shifting ways people relate to each other. Different leaders, right? I mean, it has happened in other conflicts and societies. I mean, things end and things change. And so I think a lot of what you’re saying, certainly prior to 10/7, was right. And I think, again, the kind of shame that I alluded to earlier is that for a lot of us the decision was to just kind stop paying attention to it. Because I don’t live in Israel. And I don’t support what Israel has been doing. And I don’t support what their government has become. And I don’t have to live under it. If that is not sustainable, and I think a lot of us have had the experience that there is a deep tie here and so tragedy and trauma, both in Israel and in Gaza and in Palestine, watching this become everybody’s horror forces a kind of re-engagement. And I don’t have an answer on this. I am genuinely struggling with it. I opened the inbox of the show all the time and I get flooded by Israeli emails saying, yeah, look, this is all nice, but we need to be safe and you have no answer for that. And so that I think is a thing that I’m struggling to even explore on this show, which is forget a deal. Just are there factions, are there possibilities that begin to move towards positive sum? I mean, it seems to me that it should be possible that equality should bring security. That’s been true in many other places. It doesn’t seem impossible here. But I don’t know how to convince anyone of that. And of course, it’s all easy to say from a podcast studio in New York.

amjad iraqi

I mean, I can give a real example to show that there’s a different model that’s being practiced as we speak. And it’s a model that’s very imperfect for a host of reasons. And that is the experience of Palestinian citizens of Israel or Arab citizens of Israel, who, like I said, make up 20 percent of the citizenry. I’m one of them. So I mean, for people who maybe are not so familiar, basically after the Nakba of ‘48, you still had about 150,000 Palestinians on the Israeli side of the border of the armistice lines. And the state, for a host of complex reasons, gave them Israeli citizenship. And we’ve had the right to vote since 1948, 1950. And in theory, we’re supposed to be given equal rights. But in reality, since day one, there’s a massive legal, political policy infrastructure that makes us second class citizens, to put it nicely. And that discrimination, that inequality is not just something about historical gaps. It’s an act of constant, especially in the past couple of years. I mean, there’s a lot to unpack in this, but this community identifies itself as Palestinian Arab that was able to stay in their historical homeland even as their historical homeland was completely usurped and transformed. But this community knows Hebrew. They’ve been exposed to Jewish society as a civilian society, differently from Palestinians in the occupied territories who mostly see Israelis as settlers and soldiers up front. We’re exposed to their language, to their culture, to their religion, to their ideas. And despite our inequality, and despite the discrimination, and despite the demonization, and despite being described as demographic threats and enemies, and what have you, and even in our second class status, we can still understand Jewish-Israeli society and come to a different kinds of arrangements and terms, whereby we’re even working in the same socioeconomic centers. Palestinian citizens vote in the same parliament, the Knesset. There are models and methods to this. We’re a community that really defies the green line. Even before Gaza was under blockade, Palestinian citizens, to this day, we still have family and national connections to people in Gaza, in the West Bank, even in refugees in exile. The West Bank is part and parcel of daily life of Palestinian citizens. The border does not operate on us. And it doesn’t operate on anyone with an Israeli license plate or a blue ID card. But we’re actually showing that there’s a life that actually can go between the river and the sea, that can actually be inside the homeland. And to go about politics and a way of life, which isn’t just as demonized idea that, oh, the Palestinians are going to come to kill us. And that I think is a very useful model in the community that for all its flaws and imperfections and all these internal issues and it’s still operating in a state that still wants to see them gone for the most part. But that we still have this space to provide something different. I should also just add that Palestinian citizens have a lot of diversity, even politically from your secular to your Islamists, and from your nationalists to your Communist, and what have you. But the underlying core of all their political ideas is centered around what they describe as like national equality or a state for all its citizens. But that experience, again, it’s almost like a leading model for what the Palestinian struggle could be and what a real future vision can be. But it’s also evidence that for most Jewish-Israelis, they cannot accept that. They see the idea of full equality as a threat to the Jewish state. And it’s not just something about in theory. In practice, from the Knesset all the way down, when Palestinian citizens even try to practice that, let alone even propose as a political idea, it’s roundly rejected. And even in spite of everything, Palestinian citizens, even now after Oct. 7, their leaders in the public are still coming out to say that there’s a different way around this. But here, again, and with its American Jews or even Jewish-Israelis, if they can’t even tolerate the idea that we need to break down the, quote unquote, “Jewish state” in order to create a state for all its citizens, a place of real equality, then it’s on others to meet us and to meet our equilibrium point. But in search of any kind of optimistic light, I think that community is an important place to start.

ezra klein

I think I’ll leave it there. Always our final question, what are three books you would recommend to the audience?

amjad iraqi

One that has been very much on my mind since I read it was actually “East West Street” by Philippe Sands. It’s an amazing book, which I read a couple of years ago, and has really just stuck in my mind day in and day out, and even more so over these past weeks. For those who haven’t read it, it beautifully traces both the personal family history and also the history of anti-Semitism and the Jewish experience in Europe and how people thought about these things. But basically how it was also enwrapped with two of the kind of architects of the idea of genocide, Raphael Lemkin and Hersch Lauterpacht. That genocide is also about the idea of erasing the essence of a community, of destroying them even in part, and that death is a means for something almost more nefarious. And it’s been ringing in my head a lot because of — even if people think that’s somehow extreme, what we’re seeing in Gaza just kept bringing me back to that. And how even a lot of the psychology that played in with the characters of this book. How it still resonates even for me and how it resonates for Palestinians. And that even if people who seem like this is kind of unacceptable to even begin to compare, I urge you to read or reread that book. And for those who haven’t read it, I mean, I would always recommend “Orientalism” by Edward Said, which is so formative for me, but really helps you to also understand even some of the premises of why Palestinians and the Arab world, how they understand the way that the West has looked at them, and the structures of power, and how ideas can manifest themselves, and just the history of colonialism and how that still operates to this day. And the third book is “The Fire Next Time” by James Baldwin. Anything by Baldwin, to be honest. The way that he just captures the experience of racism just resonates so much for Palestinians. And just his command of the language is just so gripping. And the ferocity with which every line that he writes just carries. I’m really not kidding when I say Palestinians really look to him in many respects of just being able to articulate that. And I would highly recommend reading him at this moment to understand what it means to be a community that’s so heavily discriminated and marginalized. Even though it’s different context, Palestinians can see all that Baldwin wrote kind of word for word and feel what he wrote word for word. So yeah, those would be my three.

sabrina tavernise

From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise, and this is “The Daily.” [MUSIC PLAYING] It’s been one month since the attack on Israel, but Washington has yet to deliver an aid package to its closest ally. The reason has to do with a different ally in a different war. Today, my colleague, Catie Edmundson on the battle within the Republican Party over whether to keep funding Ukraine. It’s Tuesday, November 7. Catie, nice to see you.

catie edmondson

Good to see you, Sabrina.

sabrina tavernise

Where am I catching you? I see some very ornate mirrors in the background.

catie edmondson

Yeah, it’s my house, actually. No, I’m in the Senate Press Gallery, which also, I apologize for any noise in the background.

sabrina tavernise

So Catie, OK, we’re going to ignore the noise, and we’re going to just dive into it here. We spend a lot of time over the past year talking about the many battles playing out on Capitol Hill. Of course, the most recent one was the fight among House Republicans over who would become Speaker. But the war between Hamas and Israel has created a whole new battle in Congress. And that’s over the question of funding foreign wars. Israel is, of course, a very close ally of the United States. And as you know, normally, we throw tons of money at our close ally, and no one would really question it. But it sounds like that’s not what’s happening right now. So tell me what’s going on.

catie edmondson

That’s right. I mean, we’re in kind of a striking moment where we’re about a month in after the war broke out. And Congress has yet to send any emergency aid to Israel and actually at the moment is not close to doing so. The House introduced this sharply partisan bill for Israel funding last week, one that basically was dead on arrival in the Senate. And so they’re kind of back to square one on this.

sabrina tavernise

And why is that?

catie edmondson

I mean, it’s extremely unusual for Congress to be having these types of partisan fights over emergency aid, especially to an ally like Israel, but what I think what we’re seeing play out really reflects that it’s a very fraught moment politically on Capitol Hill when it comes to funding, actually, a different conflict, which is the war in Ukraine.

sabrina tavernise

The war in Ukraine?

catie edmondson

Yeah, that’s right. So I think to really understand the dynamic of what’s going on here, you have to look back to a couple of weeks ago when President Biden gave an address in the Oval Office —

archived recording (joe biden) Good evening, my fellow Americans. We’re facing an inflection point in history, one of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come.

catie edmondson

— making the case, essentially, that it is imperative that America sends aid to Israel and continues to send aid to Ukraine as well.

archived recording (joe biden) The assault on Israel echoes nearly 20 months of war, tragedy, and brutality inflicted on the people of Ukraine.

catie edmondson

And so in that address, he’s really linking these two conflicts together. He’s linking together the importance of aiding both Israel and Ukraine.

archived recording (joe biden) Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common. They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy, completely annihilate it.

catie edmondson

And tying those two together is a really important piece of his pitch.

archived recording (joe biden) American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with. To put all that at risk, if we walk away from Ukraine, if we turn our backs on Israel, it’s just not worth it.

catie edmondson

The case he is really making in that speech was that this is an important moment for America to lead, to show that we support our allies, and that we support our allies crucially in standing up to tyrants and terrorists abroad.

archived recording (joe biden) That’s why tomorrow, I’m going to send to Congress an urgent budget request to fund America’s national security needs to support our critical partners, including Israel and Ukraine.

sabrina tavernise

I remember that speech. I remember watching it. And the idea was kind of American leadership is what holds the world together. If Putin wins, that will only embolden Hamas. These things are all connected. But why did Biden feel the need to tie the two together? Like, why was that important to do in the speech?

catie edmondson

Well, it’s two things, Sabrina. One is exactly the ideology that you just articulated. That is something that the White House truly believes. But it is also nodding to a political reality on the Hill that has really complicated efforts to continue sending aid to Ukraine. And that is among House Republicans, funding Ukraine, continuing to send military aid to Kyiv has become a politically toxic issue for a sizable number of lawmakers and their voters. And so from the White House’s perspective, by linking together funding for Israel, which has strong support in Washington right now, along with funding for Ukraine, the hope in the Biden administration is that they can get more of these Ukraine skeptics on board.

sabrina tavernise

OK. So Catie, let’s dig into that. So you’ve just told me a growing number of House Republicans no longer want to fund Ukraine. So break that down for me.

catie edmondson

Well, I think that this is part of a larger trend that we started to see honestly when former President Donald Trump came into office, which was really the idea among Republicans that the idea of American leadership around the globe when it comes to foreign wars was actually not a positive thing, that if the US is spending money, it should be benefiting Americans, rather than people abroad. But I think we really saw this crystallize when it comes to the war in Ukraine over the past year or two. And you know, Sabrina, I travel across the country a fair amount to go to congressional town halls, town halls that lawmakers have. And almost every single time I have been to a town Hall in a deeply conservative district, congressional district, without fail, you will hear constituents extremely angry at the idea of if I’m having trouble paying for my medication, if I’m having trouble putting dinner on the table for my family, why are we sending all of this money over to another country? And so that is something that lawmakers, Republican lawmakers tell me that they hear all of the time that they have really metabolized. And at the beginning of the war, we heard a lot of rhetoric from House Republicans saying Putin is a tyrant. We can’t allow this to happen. We’re praying for those in Ukraine. But the longer that this war has dragged out, we’ve heard less and less of that, and we’ve heard more and more questions about, what’s the end game here? How much money can we really be expected to send over there? And a lot of it is really motivated by what they’re hearing from their constituents.

sabrina tavernise

I mean, it makes sense to some extent because the counteroffensive in Ukraine has been going on for months. The Ukrainians haven’t taken much territory. And it’s hard to get people excited about dumping a lot more money into what is, from their perspective, a losing battle.

catie edmondson

Yeah, I think there’s also a lot of PTSD among voters with respect to the wars in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Iraq. I talked to some Republican pollsters who have looked at this issue. And what we also see in the polls is that funding Ukraine with every month essentially becomes a little less popular among Republican voters. And of course Republican lawmakers, particularly, those up for re-election every two years, want to be extremely responsive to that and increasingly do not want to be seen taking an up or down vote on the House floor sending billions of dollars to another country.

sabrina tavernise

And Catie, just to be clear, this logic of not wanting to send foreign aid to Ukraine that the constituents are talking about, why doesn’t it apply to sending foreign aid to Israel in this moment for House Republicans?

catie edmondson

Yeah, it’s a really complicated answer, but the bottom line for a lot of these Republican lawmakers who are against continuing to send money to Kyiv, but feel comfortable, or in fact, support sending money to Israel is that they simply see Israel as being different. They see it as a long time ally of the United States, one that because of historical background is important to support. And so when they think about their support for Israel, it’s a completely different calculation than when they’re thinking about Ukraine.

sabrina tavernise

So basically, this Biden measure was kind of his way of trying to salvage funding for Ukraine by riding on the coattails of this sky high support that Israel has in Washington, basically saying to Republicans, you guys, I know a lot of you aren’t really sure about supporting Ukraine anymore, but you can’t say no to Israel, right?

catie edmondson

Yeah, that’s right. But what you see from Speaker Johnson is that not only does he defy that request by deciding that he is going to put just a standalone Israel bill on the floor, but he actually moves to further spite Democrats on this vote. And what we see in this bill is that he adds a provision to the bill that says, in order to pay for $14 billion of new spending and emergency aid for Israel, that they are going to take back $14 billion that Congress previously had passed to help bulk up the IRS, so that it could recoup more tax money. And that has the added benefit of being good politics for the Republican conference because Republicans hated that landmark bill that President Biden passed, the Inflation Reduction Act. And while Speaker Johnson says that he added this provision simply as a nod to fiscal responsibility, we actually see him in interviews sort of dare Democrats, wink at Democrats and say, you’re going to have to show us who you’d rather support, Israel or IRS agents. So this move right off the bat infuriates Democrats. And that anger only grows when the Congressional Budget Office, which is a nonpartisan budget office comes out and says, actually, this bill, this offset that Speaker Johnson has been touting actually is going to grow the deficit. It’s actually not financially responsible at all because the government is going to lose so much money from tax revenue.

sabrina tavernise

So Democrats are basically like, no way.

catie edmondson

I mean, look, it’s a tough vote for a lot of them because a lot of them do not want to be seen as doing anything to undermine Israel particularly at this fraught moment. But essentially, the bill that Speaker Johnson created for them to vote on ends up becoming toxic for most of them.

sabrina tavernise

And of course, as you said, that bill was dead on arrival in the Senate, which is, of course, controlled by Democrats.

catie edmondson

That’s right. Hours before the House even took its vote, Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, said that the Senate wouldn’t even entertain the House passed bill, that the Senate wouldn’t even try to amend it somehow, and that senators would instead craft their own legislation to fund both Ukraine and Israel. [MUSIC PLAYING] And the interesting twist here really is that while over in the House, we saw Republicans and Democrats bitterly divided over this bill crafted by Speaker Johnson. Over in the Senate, there’s actually kind of a rare meeting of the minds among Senate Republicans, Senate Democrats, and the White House when it comes to Ukraine funding, which is they want to keep helping our allies in Kyiv. And that sets up what is likely to be a bitter rift within the Republican Party in the weeks to come. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. So Catie, you said that there’s a split among Republicans in Congress on this question of war funding for Ukraine. The House Republicans oppose it, but the Senate Republicans actually support it. So tell me about that.

catie edmondson

Yeah, that’s right. Obviously, there are a handful of exceptions. But largely what we’ve seen is that House Republicans view this issue as being fairly toxic for them among their voters, whereas Senate Republicans, many of them are really more sort of in the old school style of establishment Republican who believes in a muscular US military presence abroad, believes in the idea of the US being a leader on the global stage. And really, sort of all of those viewpoints are most clearly personified in the leader of the Senate Republican conference Mitch McConnell, who has been really the most vocal Republican on the issue of the importance of continuing to send aid to Ukraine.

sabrina tavernise

So Mitch McConnell is tying the two together in the same way that Biden is, right? Israel, and Ukraine, and funding for them. That’s a real contrast with the new guard in the House that’s pretty opposed to US interventionism and kind of less interested overall in foreign policy and in foreign wars.

catie edmondson

Absolutely. McConnell sees this as being, I think, one of the most important political fights that is currently on the world stage. He has really taken it upon himself. And I think he sees this partially as something that he wants to build into his own legacy as someone who may retire in the years to come simply because of his age. And so he has really been traveling across the United States, across the globe to try to make the case to Republican politicians and Republican voters that sending aid to Ukraine is a worthwhile investment. And he has also been remarkably candid about how he is concerned by this sort of rising wave of isolationist feeling in his own party. I went in and talked with him in his office May of last year. And essentially, what he said to me was — not exactly in these words was, I wanted to show the world that the Republican conference, the Senate Republican conference does not adhere to the isolationist viewpoints of former President Donald Trump. And for anyone who covers McConnell, those were such strikingly candid words coming from him. I honestly nearly fell out of my chair when he said that. But I think this all points to the idea that he views this as an existential battle that he is willing to lay his own personal capital down on the line for. And so this campaign from McConnell really picks up in the last couple of weeks.

archived recording (mitch mcconnell) Some say our support for Ukraine comes at the expense of more important priorities. But as I said every time I got the chance, this is a false choice.

catie edmondson

He speaks in Kentucky, his home state, of course, with the Ukrainian ambassador to make the case of why we should send more aid to Kyiv.

archived recording (mitch mcconnell) The path toward greater security for all of us is simple. Help Ukraine win the war. [APPLAUSE]

And pretty much every single day on the Senate floor, he uses his daily speech —

— to again, make the argument that in fact, the fight in Israel is intertwined with the fight in Ukraine and we have to fund both, that it would be folly to think that somehow, they’re not connected —

OK, but he can’t tell the House Republicans what to do, right? I mean, after all, he is a senator. How much does his position actually matter, given the fact that the GOP in the House does what it wants and really has been kind of its own chaos agent of late?

catie edmondson

Well, look, I think that he sees and accurately so that he does have a bully pulpit as the Republican leader in the Senate. And it is clear that he is trying to use that to advance this argument that America should continue helping our allies in Kyiv. That being said, I think you’re right, Sabrina, that there are a number of House Republicans who view him as being insufficiently conservative who don’t necessarily want to take his advice for that reason on what legislation are they should pass. A number of House Republicans and the ascendant far right of the Republican House Republican conference view him as a rhino, which is Republican in name only. Exactly, sort of the most derisive label you can slap on another Republican. And so what that means is that McConnell’s leverage really stays in the Senate. It is about keeping his own conference of Senate Republicans united around this idea of funding both Ukraine and Israel. And this matters because eventually, these two chambers are going to have to negotiate, or compromise, or come to some sort of version of legislation that they both can agree on passing. And look, when it comes to negotiations, the Senate will build up a lot of leverage if they have a big block of bipartisan votes for one bill to fund both Ukraine and Israel.

sabrina tavernise

So then how likely is it that this effort to get the House behind funding for Ukraine will actually succeed?

catie edmondson

Well, there are a number of different strategies. I think that both Senate Democrats, and the White House, and maybe even Senate Republicans are eyeing in an attempt to get House Republicans to just swallow this bill that they really would prefer not to. One is that we are coming up against a government funding deadline at the end of next week. So I think there’s one school of thought that maybe you try to just roll all of this up into one big bill, a bill that keeps the government open, that funds Israel, and that also funds Ukraine. It’s the idea of sugar to make the medicine go down. But in this time, it’s also keeping the government open, which Republicans don’t really want a shutdown right now, so that is one option.

sabrina tavernise

And of course, all roads lead back through Speaker Mike Johnson, right? So what does that mean for the fate of all of this?

catie edmondson

Well, there are a couple of different dynamics at play here. One is that you have to remember that he is the very freshly elected speaker and that the speaker before him, Kevin McCarthy was pushed out of the speaker’s office because he put two critical bills on the House floor for a vote and used Democratic votes to push them through. You have to imagine those are two lessons that he’s thinking a lot about right now. Now, at the same time in some of the public comments he has made, he has expressed openness to maybe trying to pair Ukraine funding with border security funding, so he’s showing some signs of flexibility there. But again, it is a potentially very treacherous path that he is about to walk down with really no experience. So look, I mean, this has been a crazy Congress with a lot of twists and turns. I don’t want to predict how this is going to end. I do think at the end of the day, this is an issue that is so important for the White House, for Schumer, for McConnell. Even for a handful of Republicans over in the House, I have to believe that they find some way to pass this to get this aid for Ukraine through and across the finish line. But I think it’s going to be a pretty bitter and messy battle.

sabrina tavernise

And of course, aid to Ukraine is about a lot more than just another fight in Congress, right? It’s about the biggest war in Europe since World War II that was started by Russia and preventing a critical US ally Ukraine from losing it. And we’re coming to a moment in the war where it looks like there’s actually a danger of that. The top commander there, General Zaluzhny, he told “The Economist” magazine last week that his army was at a stalemate. Like, he actually used that word. He said there’d be no, quote, “deep and beautiful breakthrough like he’d been hoping.” And the reality is American funding has been keeping Ukraine afloat in a pretty significant way. So if the US doesn’t continue it, Ukraine’s fight against Russia could actually collapse, I mean, not immediately, but it would happen.

catie edmondson

Well, you’re right, Sabrina. And it’s not only operationally important, but it’s symbolically important, right? If the US pulls its support, then potentially, you have other European countries saying, well, if the US isn’t chipping in, why should we chip in? I was actually reporting in Germany for a few months over the summer. And at the end of interviews with German politicians I would say, is there anything about US politics that I can tell you about or that you’re interested in? And without fail, people would ask me about the fate of funding for Ukraine if Republicans were to take the White House in 2024, if a Republican was to come into the White House in 2025? And in a lot of their minds, I think that was going to be the moment where they had to fear that maybe the plug would be pulled on Ukraine funding. I think a lot of them have been surprised now to see that that debate actually has come far earlier than they anticipated.

sabrina tavernise

Right, that patience for Ukraine and funding Ukraine could be running out sooner than European allies expected. And of course, that’s exactly what Putin was counting on, right? Our colleagues have reported multiple times this is a leader who understands that his competitive advantage is waiting out the West, that he will always care more than the West about Ukraine. And the West eventually will lose interest. And it looks like maybe that’s what’s starting to happen.

catie edmondson

Yeah, that’s right. And that is really the challenge for McConnell and other Republican members of Congress who want to sustain the flow of aid to Kyiv. [MUSIC PLAYING] And look, it’s something that I’m sure they are hearing from their European counterparts all the time, which is the idea of the US choosing to now choke off the aid that it sends to Kyiv is simply a frightening prospect.

sabrina tavernise

And would in some ways prove Vladimir Putin right.

catie edmondson

That’s right.

434,434,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/world/middleeast/gaza-death-toll-israel-hamas-war.html,"In just under a month, Israeli strikes have killed more than 10,000 people in Gaza and injured more than 25,000 others, the Gaza Health Ministry said on Monday.

The soaring death toll from Israel’s bombardment includes more than 4,100 children, according to the ministry, which operates under the political arm of Hamas. The ministry’s figures could not be independently verified, but a Pentagon spokesman, Brig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, acknowledged on Monday that “we know the numbers are in the thousands.”

Last month, President Biden cast doubt on death toll numbers coming from the Health Ministry, without offering an explanation. However, its statistics were considered credible enough for the U.S. State Department to cite them in a report released this year that covered previous conflicts.

After Mr. Biden’s remarks, the Health Ministry released a list with the names, ages, genders and ID numbers of all those it counted in its death toll, except for 281 whose remains were unidentifiable. The list included multiple members of numerous families, including 88 from one extended family.

Even before the latest hostilities, more than two million people in Gaza, about half of them children, were trapped by a 16-year Israeli blockade of the territory. After Hamas launched terrorist attacks on Oct. 7 in which, Israeli officials say, more than 1,400 people were killed and more than 240 abducted, Israel began a military campaign it said was aimed at destroying the group.

The grim update on civilian deaths came as Gaza was emerging from a third communications blackout, which coincided with heavy Israeli attacks.

On Monday, the head of the United Nations again urged an immediate humanitarian cease-fire, painting a dire picture. “Gaza is becoming a graveyard for children,” Secretary General António Guterres told reporters.

“Hundreds of girls and boys are reportedly being killed or injured every day,” Mr. Guterres said. “More journalists have reportedly been killed over a four-week period than in any conflict in at least three decades. More United Nations aid workers have been killed than in every comparable period in the history of our organization.”

In the first days of its strikes, the Israeli Air Force said it had dropped more than 6,000 bombs on the Gaza Strip, which covers an area roughly half the size of New York City.

On Monday, Mr. Guterres said the bombardment had struck “civilians, hospitals, refugee camps, mosques, churches, and U.N. facilities, including shelters.”

Israeli officials have so far resisted calls from the United Nations, international aid groups and protesters in Israel and around the world for a humanitarian pause. But the need for a cease-fire is becoming more urgent by the hour, said the secretary general, pointing to what he said were “clear violations” of international law in the conflict.

“No one is safe,” he said."
435,435,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/us/california-jewish-man-paul-kessler-israel-protests.html,"As a fatal clash between suburban protesters in Southern California threatened to become an international incident on Tuesday, the authorities said that it wasn’t “exactly crystal clear” how a 69-year-old Jewish man died from an altercation with a pro-Palestinian demonstrator over the weekend.

At a packed news conference, Jim Fryhoff, the Ventura County sheriff, called for calm and said his office was investigating whether the death should be criminally charged as a homicide and hate crime.

But his office had not made an arrest in the case, which stemmed from a dispute on Sunday afternoon amid dueling demonstrations at an intersection in Thousand Oaks, Calif., a suburb about 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles.

Sheriff Fryhoff said investigators had questioned a 50-year-old man from the nearby suburb of Moorpark who was protesting on Sunday in support of Palestinians and whose house they searched on Monday. But, he added, the authorities were still trying to sort out the events that led up to the death of the Jewish protester, Paul Kessler.

Witnesses said Mr. Kessler got into an argument with the pro-Palestinian demonstrator on Sunday and had fallen during the altercation, sustaining a head injury, according to the sheriff. He added that Mr. Kessler was conscious and responsive when law enforcement officers arrived at the scene, and at the hospital when they spoke to him again.

Mr. Kessler died early Monday, and an autopsy by the Ventura County Medical Examiner’s Office determined the cause to be a blunt force injury to the back of his head.

Sheriff Fryhoff said that surveillance footage and other video obtained at the scene did not provide a clear view of the encounter, and that witnesses interviewed in the immediate aftermath gave “conflicting statements” — disagreeing, for example, on what had caused Mr. Kessler to fall and who had instigated the conflict. One of the 911 calls for help after the altercation was made by the pro-Palestinian demonstrator, who remained at the scene, the sheriff added.

At Temple Etz Chaim in Thousand Oaks, the Conservative synagogue where Mr. Kessler and his wife were members, Senior Rabbi Ari Averbach said that the victim, a father of two grown children, “was not there as, like, some ongoing counterprotester looking for trouble,” but had accompanied a neighbor to the rally of about 100 people, at a local intersection anchored by a gas station and an office park.

“It’s the big intersection in our town, and it was one of those places where people go to protest, and other people roll their eyes as they drive by,” Rabbi Averbach said, noting that the synagogues and mosques in the community generally had cordial relations.

Jonathan Oswaks, 69, said in a phone interview on Monday night that he first met Mr. Kessler a week before the incident when they went to observe a similar pro-Palestinian protest. They resolved to counterprotest the next week at the intersection in Thousand Oaks, Mr. Oswaks said.

“We’ve been here, we’ve seen what this is all about,” Mr. Oswaks said of their decision. “We need to show up with people and Israeli flags.”

The pair met again on Sunday around 2 p.m., an hour before the pro-Palestinian rally was scheduled to begin, Mr. Oswaks said. He and Mr. Kessler then split up and stood on opposite sides of Westlake Boulevard, intending to “occupy space,” he said, with Mr. Kessler holding an Israeli flag.

As the pro-Palestinian demonstrators began to gather, a man whom Mr. Oswaks believed he recognized from the previous week’s protest began yelling into his ear with a megaphone, Mr. Oswaks said. The man then crossed the road and approached Mr. Kessler. Mr. Oswaks said that he saw the man swing his megaphone toward Mr. Kessler but was not sure if Mr. Kessler had been struck.

Dr. Chris R. Young, the Ventura County medical examiner, said on Tuesday that his autopsy had determined that Mr. Kessler suffered “nonlethal injuries” to the left side of his face, as well as blunt force trauma to the back of his head consistent with a fall. He said that he had deemed it a homicide — meaning that another individual contributed to Mr. Kessler’s death or was directly responsible — but that his medical determination was different from the criminal definition of homicide.

“We’re still waiting to see evidence of what occurred in that interaction and whether or not there was a blow to the face that caused the fall, or if Mr. Kessler fell without that being the precipitating event,” Sheriff Fryhoff said.

Word of Mr. Kessler’s fall ricocheted quickly across communities that were already on edge. Several mourners brought flowers and lit candles on Monday night on a ledge outside the Shell gas station near where the altercation occurred.

Rabbi Michael Barclay, of the nearby Temple Ner Simcha, said on Monday evening that he had been urging congregants not to share rumors and that he had previously discouraged community members from counterprotesting at pro-Palestinian demonstrations to avoid confrontations.

Hussam Ayloush, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations office in Los Angeles, denounced all violence and urged people to avoid “sensationalizing such a tragedy for political gains or spreading rumors that could unnecessarily escalate tensions that are already at an all-time high.”

“We urge everyone to wait for the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office to complete its investigation before drawing any conclusions,” Mr. Ayloush said in a statement. “Our thoughts are with the family and the Jewish community during this difficult time.”

The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles pointed to recent instances of antisemitic crimes in the region, which have rattled Jewish residents in Southern California.

“The fact of the matter is there is now a Jewish man who is dead,” said Rabbi Noah Farkas, the president and chief executive of the federation. “And here we are again as a Jewish community, frightened, terrified to express ourselves, to be ourselves.”

436,436,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/us/politics/biden-israel-gaza-ukraine.html,"After four weeks of terror and retaliation in Israel and Gaza, and 20 months of war in Ukraine, President Biden is confronting the limits of his leverage in the two international conflicts defining his presidency.

For 10 days, the Biden administration has been urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allow for “humanitarian pauses” in the bombing of Gaza, hoping that the $3.8 billion a year in American security assistance would carry with it enough influence over the Israeli leader’s tactics.

It has not. Mr. Netanyahu rebuffed Mr. Biden’s push for greater efforts to avoid civilian casualties in a phone call on Monday. And he has pushed ahead with what he has called “mighty vengeance” for the Oct. 7 attacks, using huge bombs to collapse Hamas’s network of tunnels, even if they also collapse whole neighborhoods in Gaza.

In Ukraine, the country’s most senior military commander, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, uttered the word last week that American officials carefully avoided for the better part of a year: stalemate. Many of Mr. Biden’s aides agree that Ukraine and Russia are dug in, unable to move the front lines of the battle in any significant way.

But they fear that General Zaluzhny’s candor will make it harder to get Republicans to vote for aggressive funding for the war — and may encourage President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to dig in, hoping former President Donald J. Trump or a Republican with similar views will be elected next year and pull back American support.

In both cases, Mr. Biden’s influence over how his allies prosecute those wars seems far more constrained than expected, given his central role as the supplier of arms and intelligence. But because the United States is so tied to both struggles, as Israel’s most powerful ally and Ukraine’s best hope of remaining a free and independent nation, the president’s legacy is tied to how those countries act, and how the wars end."
437,437,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/us/politics/democrats-cease-fire-israel-gaza.html,"Democrats in Congress, torn between their support for Israel in its war with Hamas and concern about civilian suffering in Gaza, are struggling with how far to go in calling for measures to mitigate civilian casualties as the left wing of the party escalates pressure for a cease-fire.

In recent days, several House and Senate Democrats have urged temporary humanitarian pauses to facilitate aid deliveries of food, water and fuel to the Gaza Strip, echoing the Biden administration. They have argued that the pauses are necessary to keep an already dire humanitarian crisis from worsening, and to negotiate the release of more than 200 hostages, including Americans, being held in Gaza since Hamas waged a bloody attack on civilians and soldiers in southern Israel on Oct. 7.

But few have embraced progressive Democrats’ demands for a complete and lasting cease-fire, even as pro-Palestinian protesters took to the streets over the weekend to demand a total cessation of hostilities. Most Democrats, including some of Congress’s most influential liberal leaders, have argued that a full cease-fire would give Hamas time to regroup and launch another assault on Israel.

“You’ve got to have a pause in the bombing. You’ve got to take care of the immediate disaster. Israel’s got to change its strategy,” Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and a prominent Jewish progressive, said in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “I don’t know how you can have a cease-fire — permanent cease-fire — with an organization like Hamas, which is dedicated to turmoil and chaos and destroying the state of Israel.”

The comments drew a backlash from some progressive activists that highlighted the cross pressures Democrats are dealing with on the issue. Their dilemma, which mirrors the one President Biden has been facing as he confronts growing hostility on the left to his backing of Israel, could carry political consequences for the party overall. Democrats will be heavily reliant on strong support and turnout among their liberal core supporters in their push to hold the White House and the Senate, and win control of the House, in the 2024 elections.

Richard J. Durbin of Illinois last week became the first Democratic senator to call for a cease-fire, which he said he would support under certain conditions, including Hamas first agreeing to release hostages. His decision reflected a shift underway on Capitol Hill that has coincided with changes in Mr. Biden’s public messaging on Israel.

Mr. Biden has been resolute about declaring that the United States stands in solidarity with Israel. But in the last several days, he and top administration officials have emphasized their efforts to persuade Israeli officials of the need for humanitarian pauses to allow the United Nations to deliver aid to civilians.

The change in tone comes as progressive polls indicate that a majority of Democratic voters favor a cease-fire, as well as evidence that younger people and people of color are critical of the Biden administration’s stance on the war.

Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan and the only Palestinian American in Congress, put a sharp point on the disconnect last week in a video that accused Mr. Biden of supporting a genocide in Gaza and threatened him with electoral consequences in 2024 if he failed to call for a cease-fire.

“Mr. President, the American people are not with you on this one,” Ms. Tlaib said.

International law defines genocide as a crime committed with the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, in times of war or peace. Top Israeli officials have said they are targeting Hamas, not the Palestinian people.

The video also featured pro-Palestinian protesters in Michigan chanting “from the river to the sea,” a rallying cry referring to the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea that many regard as calling for the eradication of Israel.

The backlash from other Democrats to the slogan, which the Anti-Defamation League considers antisemitic, was severe.

Representative Elissa Slotkin, also a Michigan Democrat, insisted in a series of posts on the social media platform X that Ms. Tlaib apologize.

“None of us, especially elected leaders, should amplify language that inflames a tense situation & makes it harder for our communities to find common ground,” wrote Ms. Slotkin, a centrist who is Jewish. “If I knew that a phrase I’d used had hurt any of my constituents, I would apologize & retract it, no matter its origin. I’d ask the same from you.”

Mr. Biden has requested that humanitarian aid for Palestinians be part of any package to send military assistance to Israel.

Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, also criticized Ms. Tlaib’s use of the slogan, as well as her calls for a cease-fire.

“This phrase means eradicating Israel and Jews. Period,” she wrote in a post on X. “Only a return of hostages, eliminating Hamas and liberating Gaza from oppressive terror will save civilian lives and secure the peace, justice and dignity you seek.”

Ms. Tlaib defended the slogan as “an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.” In a statement, she also accused her colleagues of focusing on pillorying her at the expense of saving lives."
438,438,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/world/middleeast/israel-jordan-aid.html,"King Abdullah II of Jordan said on Monday that his country’s air force had airdropped “urgent medical aid” to a field hospital operated by the kingdom in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military confirmed the unusual move and said in a statement that it had been a coordinated effort between the neighboring nations.

In a post on social media, the king said it was “our duty to aid our brothers and sisters injured in the war on Gaza.” Photographs shared in his post showed soldiers loading a large wooden crate bearing a Jordanian flag onto a military aircraft with a forklift.

Israel’s blockade and recent siege of Gaza have put some hospitals out of service, and aid deliveries through the Rafah crossing with Egypt have been inadequate, humanitarian groups say. This appeared to be the first time in this war that aid was dropped into Gaza from the air.

The Israeli military said the shipment included medical supplies and food that would “be used by the medical staff for patients.”

Dropping aid from a plane required a “complex logistical operation,” Jordan’s communications minister, Muhannad Mubaideen, said on Monday in a television interview.

The move comes amid growing condemnation by Jordanian leaders of Israel since it began its bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip and largely prevented food, water and electricity from entering the besieged enclave, in response to Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7.

On Wednesday the kingdom ordered the immediate recall of its ambassador to Israel over the war. Similarly, Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, ordered Israel’s ambassador in Amman — who had already left the country — not to return.

“The return of the ambassadors will be tied to Israel stopping its war on Gaza and stopping the humanitarian disaster,” the foreign ministry said.

Mr. Safadi also bluntly told Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken in a news conference in Amman, the Jordanian capital, on Saturday to “stop this madness.”

Israel and Jordan maintain a crucial regional alliance, and the kingdom is the custodian of the Aqsa compound in Jerusalem, a key holy site that is often a source of disputes and conflict with Palestinians.

At the same time, large crowds have been protesting across the kingdom, where many are of Palestinian origin, for the past month demanding a humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza. Some have demonstrated daily in front of the Israeli Embassy in Amman.

439,439,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/world/middleeast/antisemitic-islamophobic-incidents-australia-israel-war.html,"Posters plastered across Sydney portraying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel as Adolf Hitler in disguise. A record increase in reports of Islamophobia, including threats to Muslim community organizations. Antisemitic chants at a pro-Palestinian rally and charges that Nazi salutes were performed outside a Jewish museum.

Australia has experienced a flurry of incidents targeting Muslims and Jews, making it one of many countries reporting a rise in such cases since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks on Israel.

Reports to the Islamophobia Register Australia, an independent organization that tracks anti-Muslim sentiment, have increased tenfold since the start of the war, Sharara Attai, the executive director of the group, told an Australian news service, adding that many more incidents have likely gone unreported.

Interfaith relations have become strained, with at least two Australian rabbis resigning last month from the Jewish Muslim Christian Association, a group that works to promote religious harmony, after some faith leaders failed to condemn the Hamas attacks, which killed some 1,400 people in Israel. Members of the country’s roughly 100,000-strong Jewish community have been left feeling isolated, representatives said, over a perceived absence of sympathy for the suffering caused by the attacks.

Lee Kofman, a writer in Melbourne, organized an open letter that was signed by hundreds of Australian Jewish scholars, journalists and workers in creative industries who said they felt unsafe in their workplaces and abandoned by colleagues.

“It really shook us to the core of our identity,” Ms. Kofman said. “We belong to this progressive tribe, but the progressive tribe doesn’t seem to have very progressive values when it comes to us Jews.”

Signatories of the letter expressed “our dismay and shock at the lack of public understanding and empathy shown towards Jewish people,” as well as what they described as little acknowledgment of the suffering the attacks in Israel have caused.

Australia has the highest concentration of Holocaust survivors of any nation outside Israel, and many Australian Jews have deep and longstanding ties with Israel. A poll in June of the Australian Jewish community found that 77 percent of respondents identified as Zionist, and 88 percent said they felt a “high level of personal connectedness” with Israel.

Shows of support for Palestinians, including from elected representatives, have been criticized by some in the Jewish community over what they said was a lack of understanding of Hamas, which has stated that it wants to destroy Israel.

Tens of thousands of Australians have marched at rallies in cities including Adelaide, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney in support of the Palestinians. Protesters called for a cease-fire, denounced deadly Israeli strikes on civilians in Gaza as “genocide” and chanted, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” — a popular pro-Palestinian slogan that some view as a call for Israel’s destruction.

On Monday, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, an umbrella organization for hundreds of Australian Jewish groups, condemned a decision by 11 national lawmakers from the Australian Green Party to walk out of Parliament because the Labor government had not called for a cease-fire in Gaza. A spokesman for the organization said the lawmakers’ stance “endangered Australian Jews and our society.”"

They make snap decisions amid the screams of small children undergoing amputations or brain surgeries without anesthesia or clean water to wash their wounds.

Some veterans of wartime medicine in the Gaza Strip say conditions inside the overcrowded and impoverished territory are the worst they have ever seen, as entire apartment blocks, schools and hospitals crumble under an Israeli bombardment that has meted out a devastating civilian toll.

“Our teams are physically and psychologically exhausted,” said Basem al Najjar, the deputy of the head of Al Aqsa Hospital in the city of Deir al Balah in central Gaza."
442,442,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/opinion/jewish-palestine-literature.html,"Last May, my husband and I invited a Palestinian friend for Shabbat dinner, and when he asked what to bring, I requested a book about his homeland for our 7-year-old son. Because this friend is lavishly generous and wasn’t sure of our child’s reading level, he showed up with a gift bag of titles about Palestinian children and their experiences, ranging from picture books to a four-volume series of middle-grade novels.

In the wake of the devastating atrocities committed by Hamas on Oct. 7 and the subsequent weeks of violence in Gaza, I have found myself reaching for those books.

Children’s books, which present subtle truths in simple terms, offer a valuable tool in retaining our moral bearings, especially amid a maelstrom of grief and rage. These books, in their simplicity and brevity, can grant polarized communities access to each other’s stories, reminding us of our shared humanity and common interest in finding a way toward peaceful coexistence.

In the books I read with my son, I saw the Palestinian children’s authors of today doing something I recognize from my research on the Yiddish children’s literature of the previous century: striving to help children make sense of the world they stand to inherit while writing a better world into being.

The canon of Yiddish literature that I’ve studied draws on books and periodicals created from 1900 to 1970 on four continents under a range of political auspices — including socialism, communism, labor Zionism and just plain Yiddishism — by an array of educators, high-culture authors and specialized children’s writers. These writers built exciting fictive worlds for their readers to escape to and aspire to — while urging them to endure and redress persistent, real-world social problems, such as income inequality and perennial antisemitic violence.

The Yiddish writers of a century ago described magical Sabbaths and capricious rulers, the distinctive joys and sorrows that inflected Ashkenazi Jewish history and identity, without losing sight of ice skating and schoolroom dramas — in other words, the sorts of frolics and fears that pertain to childhood all over.

Yiddish stories emphasize the ways children can act ethically and carry their culture forward. Instead of reinforcing conventional nationalism, these works followed the general tendency of Yiddish literature, art and film to explore how culture might define a nation. Keenly interested in faraway civilizations, Yiddish children’s literature sought to offer its readers what the educator Emily Style calls window and mirror: reflections of their own experiences and apertures onto the experiences of others. Over decades and across oceans, these writers counted on their stories to turn vilde khayes (the ungovernable “wild things” that Maurice Sendak imported into the English lexicon) into specimens of ethical humanity capable of mitlayd (compassion, literally, “suffering with”).

Narrative fiction is an exceptionally potent means for conveying others’ suffering and cultivating empathy, and children’s literature is no exception; adults who fail to appreciate the seriousness of this literary enterprise, or worse, attempt to restrict or ban it, trivialize the processes whereby children learn to think and feel — and so alienate themselves from influencing the future.

An entire generation of Israelis and Palestinians, as well as those abroad who care about their fate, are now at risk of further losing faith in the possibility of peace. At this critical moment, children’s books can help in two important ways: First, they establish a realm where we can bear witness to one another’s pain, fear and joy. In “Sitti’s Secrets” by Naomi Shihab Nye — a gentle, poetic evocation of a Palestinian American girl’s visit to her grandmother and cousins who live “on the other side of the earth” — the sustained note of exilic longing is tempered by joyful connection. In Hannah Moushabeck’s “Homeland: My Father Dreams of Palestine,” a Palestinian father refashions memories of his youth in the Old City of Jerusalem into bedtime stories for his daughters. Amahl Bishara’s 2005 “The Boy and the Wall” is set closer geographically to the conflict and offers a child’s-eye view of the separation barrier erected in the West Bank. A colorful book in English and Arabic, it was created with children living in the Aida refugee camp near Bethlehem and, naturally, reflects their confusion and pain at life under unending occupation — and communicates that to its readers.

These are titles I want my own child exposed to. And I want non-Jewish families to read books that represent our full humanity, in all our particular Jewish vulnerability and joy. As the cultural critic Marjorie Ingall has noted, Holocaust themes are overrepresented among titles about Jews from American mainstream publishers, while many Jewish children’s authors and librarians feel that everyday Jewish life in Israel is underrepresented. I’d like for American readers to have broader access to depictions of Jewish flourishing, including in Israel, as in Janice Hechter’s “Adventure Girl: Dabi Digs in Israel.” To be seen in our wholeness and complexity and to see others in the same way — this is part of what these books can offer.

But children’s literature fosters more than just basic awareness of the similarities and differences in our shared humanity: It conjures a realm where we can imagine — together — something better than what is. “Daniel and Ismail” by Juan Pablo Iglesias is pitched to children ages 3 to 6 and tells the story of two boys, one Palestinian and one Jewish, who overcome their parents’ objections to form a friendship on the soccer field. The plot subtly acknowledges that a new generation will have to figure out how to make peace and that it is possible for children to lead us.

The books are plentiful and inviting. They were created to write a better world into being: Now we must use them to read a better world into being. While these tales are important for the sake of young readers, they are just as critical for us adults to share. Those of us watching the news with a sense of despair need these stories, both their gentleness and their moral fierceness. The reasons for anguish pile up in body bags. Our souls are crushed by the seeming impossibility of democratic majorities to hold their leaders to account — to demand dignity, safety and peace for all throughout the region.

Children’s literature can’t solve these problems. But it creates an arena in which to dream, an essential redoubt for rational hope. And without hope, nothing good will come."
443,443,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/opinion/joe-biden-polling.html,"The savage terrorist attack on Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza are spurring many young Americans to engage with the political moment at a heightened intensity that could, ultimately, influence the 2024 presidential race. President Biden is offering plentiful support to Israel, though with more words of caution recently. Yet according to multiple recent polls, fewer than a quarter of young voters — who were crucial to Democratic victories in 2020 and overperformance in 2022 — approve of the way that the president is handling the response to the war between Israel and Hamas.

In an Economist/YouGov survey of U.S. adults, more than a third of respondents ages 18 to 29 reported that the Israeli government’s response to the Oct. 7 attacks that claimed 1,400 lives is “too harsh.” Each day Israel bombards Gazans and the United States is not viewed as a peacemaker, Mr. Biden’s political position takes a hit with younger voters who see the war largely through the life-or-death prism of human rights.

To be clear, most 20- and 30-somethings agree that Hamas committed war crimes in Israel. Most do not look at this as an either/or situation: They want America to help both the Israeli and the Palestinian people. But young progressives remain unconvinced of their government’s commitment to safeguarding the innocent. If that continues, the winning Biden 2020 coalition is at greater risk of fracturing — and in the process, making Donald Trump’s return to the White House more likely.

Many young voters have been reluctant to back Mr. Biden for some time now, despite record-setting levels of support from Gen Zers and millennials in 2020. The latest battleground state polls by The New York Times and Siena College show Mr. Biden holding a one-point lead over Mr. Trump among registered voters under 30 and a six-point lead among likely voters in the same age category. In 2020, exit polls showed Mr. Biden winning the youth vote cohort, 60 to 36 percent."
444,444,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/opinion/biden-trump-times-siena.html,"Gail Collins: Bret, I know you’re busy writing about your reporting trip to Israel, and I am looking forward to reading all your thoughts. But, gee, can we talk about the Times/Siena poll on the presidential race that came out on Sunday? Donald Trump is ahead in almost all the critical states.

Yow. Pardon me while I pour myself a drink.

Bret Stephens: Nice to be home. Please pour me one while you’re at it.

For readers who don’t know the gory details of the poll, here they are: Across six battleground states, Trump leads President Biden 48 percent to 44 percent among registered voters. In the crucial swing states that Biden won last time, Trump is ahead in five — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania — while Biden leads only in Wisconsin. Biden is losing support from young voters, Hispanic voters, Black voters — constituencies Democrats have depended on for decades to overcome the longstanding Republican advantage among whites.

Women voters favor Biden by eight percentage points, 50 percent to 42 percent, but men favor Trump by a far wider 18-point spread: 55 percent to 37 percent. (I guess that’s another definition for the term “manspreading.”) On the economy, voters prefer Trump over Biden by a 22-point margin. And a whopping 71 percent think Biden is too old to be president, as opposed to just 39 percent for Trump."
445,445,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/05/us/stanford-hit-and-run-hate-crime.html,"The authorities have opened a hate crime investigation into the report of a hit-and-run on Friday that left an Arab Muslim student injured at Stanford University.

According to the university, a black S.U.V. hit the student on the campus in Stanford, Calif., just before 2 p.m. The driver left the scene, and the student was being treated for injuries that were not life-threatening.

The student told university officials that the driver, whom he described as a white man in his mid-20s driving a Toyota 4Runner, made eye contact with him before accelerating and striking him, according to an advisory shared by the public safety department at Stanford on Saturday. The student told officials that the man then drove away while shouting an expletive and referring to “you and your people.”

The Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office said that it had opened a hate crime investigation based on preliminary information from the California Highway Patrol. Neither the Sheriff’s Office nor the Highway Patrol commented further on the investigation. The authorities did not release the driver’s name.

In a statement shared by a student group that has been organizing sit-ins on campus to protest Israel’s actions in Gaza amid its war with Hamas, the student who reported being struck said that he recognized the driver as someone “who had previously shown animosity” toward his community and that he was disappointed in what he described as a slow and inadequate response by the university.

A spokeswoman for Stanford University said in an email that campus authorities issued information to the campus community as soon as they had enough details to do so.

In a statement shared with the Stanford community on Friday, the university’s president, Richard Saller, and its provost, Jenny Martinez, said that they were “profoundly disturbed to hear this report of potentially hate-based physical violence on our campus.” Such violence, they added, is “morally reprehensible, and we condemn it in the strongest terms.”

The hate crime investigation comes as tensions over the Israel-Hamas war have roiled university campuses. Last month, the personal information of Harvard students was published online after they signed a letter, published on the night of the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, saying that Israel was responsible for the violence. Columbia recently closed its campus to the public amid tensions between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian protesters, and Cornell canceled classes last week after antisemitic threats.

In the wake of the hit-and-run report, Stanford’s public safety department said that it was deploying additional security at “key locations” on campus."
446,446,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/05/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-blinken-iraq.html,"Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, in visits to both the West Bank and Iraq, sought to reassure Palestinian leaders on Sunday that the United States was committed to minimizing harm to civilians under fire in the Gaza Strip from Israel and to warn Iran not to jump into the conflict.

Mr. Blinken, who has been in the Middle East since Friday, early in the day held an unannounced meeting in the Israeli-occupied West Bank with the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. Then, in another surprise visit, he traveled to Baghdad, reinforcing a signal to Iran that the United States is prepared to defend its allies in the region against aggression by Iran or its proxies.

“It was very important to send a very clear message to anyone who might seek to take advantage of the conflict in Gaza to threaten our personnel here or anywhere else in the region: Don’t do it,” Mr. Blinken said in a brief address at the Baghdad airport.

During his visit to the West Bank city of Ramallah earlier in the day, Mr. Blinken spoke to Mr. Abbas about U.S. efforts to get Israeli leaders to “minimize civilian harm” in Gaza, a senior State Department official said.

The Health Ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip says more than 9,700 people in the territory have been killed in the Israeli campaign.

Mr. Abbas called for “an immediate halt” to the war in Gaza and an end to Israeli attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank, which he described as “no less horrific,” according to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency.

Civilians in Gaza were continuing to pay a heavy toll on Sunday.

An explosion overnight in a densely populated residential area in the central Gaza Strip destroyed several buildings and appeared to have killed and wounded many people, photos and videos from the scene showed."

The Gazan Health Ministry said an Israeli airstrike had hit Al Maghazi — a community built up from a refugee camp established decades ago — killing at least 47 people and wounding dozens of others. It warned that the toll was expected to rise, saying that many bodies remained buried under the rubble.

Casualties were taken to nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where a photographer for The New York Times saw the injured crowding the hallways and the lifeless being prepared for burial.

A spokesperson for the Israeli military said it was looking into reports of the strike.

Israel struck an area near Gaza City last week, Jabaliya, that had also its origins as a refugee camp. Hamas, the armed group that controls Gaza, and local doctors said that hundreds of people had been wounded or killed. Israel said the strike had killed a Hamas leader and other operatives and hit a network of Hamas tunnels that it said lay below the residential buildings. The reports of many deaths and the level of destruction provoked international outrage."
448,448,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/05/opinion/israel-palestinians-hostage-silence.html,"On Oct. 24 my brother and I went to the United Nations to watch an emergency Security Council meeting in response to the war in Israel and Gaza. As the Israeli minister of foreign affairs listed the names and held up photos of some of the Israeli children who were taken hostage by Hamas, a white woman in her 30s stood up near us in the gallery to protest. She held up a handmade “Free Palestine” sign.

The disruption should have been jarring, but by this point in the war, I am accustomed to this response from those I once regarded as my liberal peers. I’ve seen too often the hijacking of the cause of Palestinian liberation to stand against the lives of Israeli children who have been in captivity for four weeks. Three of them are my little cousins.

On Oct. 7 I spent the day waiting for news from my family in Israel. My cousin Sharon Cunio; her husband, David; their 3-year-old twins, Emma and Yuli; my cousin Danielle Alony; and her 5-year-old daughter, Amelia, were hiding together in their bomb shelter while Hamas went on a murderous rampage through their kibbutz. The last contact my family has had from them is a WhatsApp message simply saying, “Help, we’re dying.” By evening, my aunt had confirmed our fears: My six relatives were missing from Kibbutz Nir Oz, a community in the south of Israel about three miles from Gaza now known as a scene of brutality and destruction.

An hour after discovering they were missing, I spotted some of my family on a TikTok video. They were being carted away, surrounded by machine-gun-carrying terrorists shouting “Allahu akbar.” The pain I experienced in that moment and in so many after has been so sharp, it follows my every breath. I wake up each morning only to remember again my family is being held hostage by terrorists.

Recently, my brother and I hung “kidnapped” posters of our family around Williamsburg in Brooklyn, a famously liberal community I’ve been part of for over a decade. Within a day, almost all of them had been ripped down. Some were replaced with posters reading, “Honor the martyr.” The behavior feels so senseless, even hateful, but it is not these overt acts that make me feel isolated.

Instead I feel loneliest when I scroll through Instagram and see friends and acquaintances, Jews and non-Jews alike, reposting a protest image calling for a cease-fire from Jewish Voice for Peace in between their fall foliage photos. These are the same people who watch my stories but who have not once shared the faces of my 3-year-old cousins or demanded the release of the hostages, despite my increasingly desperate cries for help and humanity. The silence is suffocating. What I wouldn’t give to not know this pain, to have a different truth from the one I am carrying.

All around me I have witnessed a silence so enormous, it feels cacophonous; I have seen former co-workers be so quick to share unverified headlines fed by Hamas yet say only a few private words of sympathy to me. It would appear they believe my suffering to be collateral damage in service of some universal truth they hold higher. Is it really impossible to hold these two truths at the same time — that both Israeli and Palestinian civilians are suffering at great cost? Or are they simply unwilling to express that publicly? I’m not sure which is worse.

I have felt lost watching progressive friends, women’s rights activists, influencers and celebrities I admire stumble to find the words to condemn the atrocities committed by Hamas against Israeli civilians, among them six of the human beings I love most in the world. Even as I sit here thinking of my family and some 240 other Israeli hostages, I scroll through my news feed and cry for the innocent Palestinian children and lives lost in Gaza. I look at the face of Mohammed Abujayyab, a man in Los Angeles who was trying to save his grandmother in Gaza, and I see my own pain reflected in his expression.

Again and again I hear that Israel is a country of white colonizers and oppressors. So some of my bewilderment is in my very skin. My maternal grandparents, Avraham and Sara, grew up in a tiny rural village in central Yemen. Like other Jews in the Arabian Peninsula, Yemenite Jews were persecuted as second-class citizens through what are known as dhimmi laws — the denigration of non-Muslims before the law. In 1949, after pogroms against Jews in Yemen, my grandparents set out by foot and donkey on an arduous journey to the capital, Sana. From there, they were airlifted during Operation Magic Carpet to the newly formed state of Israel. As refugees fleeing oppression in their birth country, they began their lives in Israel in poverty. Slowly they built a humble but comfortable life and raised five children, among them my mother.

So maybe you can imagine my surprise the first time I heard my Israeli family called “white colonizers.” When did we become white? And how could a family fleeing persecution be perceived as colonizers? I have heard this description for years; perhaps I shrugged it off too easily. But it’s not the catchphrases or even the loudest and most inflammatory voices that have made me feel so betrayed. Rather, it’s those who have remained silent when they otherwise would never be, like the women who lifted up the #MeToo movement alongside me yet now refuse to cry out against even the violence against women or rape reported by an Israeli military forensics team.

New reports about the sickening crimes committed at the hands of Hamas continue to come out of Israel, but the left seems to be focused only on the response from Israel, undeniably a devastating one. I never imagined that the left — my own world — would not be able to at least hold space for both Israeli and Palestinian civilians.

I haven’t had much strength to take on this silence. Since Oct. 7, I have focused all of my energy on taking action to urge my family’s immediate and safe release. I spoke at the U.N. I’ve been on endless broadcasts and been forced to recount my cousin’s harrowing last voice message too many times to count. I have poured myself into this all while struggling with almost indescribable grief. Outside of the Jewish community, it has proved to be a lonely struggle. There were no apolitical spaces created to help the hostage families hold the weight of this pain.

At the beginning of all this, I promised I would scream to the ends of the earth for my family, and that’s exactly what I’m doing. Everyone in my large extended family has mobilized alongside me, demanding the safe return of our loved ones and of all the hostages. We’ve been told by the Israel Defense Forces that my family is alive in Gaza, and for now, this gives us a glimmer of hope. In Israel my aunt Riki, whose core family of 10 has been reduced to four around her Shabbat table, is trying to stay upright while bearing a mother’s anguish. People come by daily and bring food as if they were sitting shiva.

I am grateful she is being held up by her community. Here, in my home, I no longer know to whom I can turn in my grief."

450,450,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/05/us/politics/israel-hamas-war-palestinians-conversation.html,"The women agreed to meet at a school Ms. Oliver founded three years ago.

When the pandemic hit, Ms. Oliver grew frustrated watching wealthy, largely white, parents pay teachers for private learning “pods,” exacerbating inequities. In the fall of 2020, she opened a small “holistic, anti-racist and dual-language” school in a neighborhood that once served as the redlined demarcation for Black and white residents.

After a tour of the four-room school, the women sat in an office Ms. Oliver rents from a neighboring church. (Ms. Oliver, when asked about her religion, described herself as secular.) They sat facing each other in faux leather chairs, their knees nearly touching. A large piece of paper tacked to the wall outlined Ms. Oliver’s strategies and plans for the school. Framed photos of young Black girls engrossed in studies sat on the mantel.

Neither came with an organized set of questions, but each had goals. Ms. Minkin said she partly wanted Ms. Oliver to understand the justification of existence of the state of Israel and to recognize the role of antisemitism. Ms. Oliver was focused on U.S. support for the Israeli government’s policies and how her views on racism and oppression in the United States related to the Palestinians.

“I have a very strong affiliation with marginalized people — brown, displaced, refugees, Black,” Ms. Oliver recalled saying at the beginning of the conversation. “We usually hear the perspective of those in power, and our school is about amplifying the voices of the disempowered.”

Ms. Oliver then asked Ms. Minkin about “settler colonialism” and the Palestinians forced out of their homes after the creation of the state of Israel. She recalled expressing disbelief that the displacement “felt OK to Jewish people.”

“How could people accept that and how could that be a just thing?” she wondered.

Ms. Minkin thought that question was an oversimplification. Jews also have historical ties to the land, she said, describing the region as having “two indigenous people,” Arabs and Jews. She talked about decades of violent attacks against Jews in Israel.

“We have to acknowledge that the policies that have been applied this far have failed,” she recalled saying, expressing her hope for both groups to live in peace. “I hope that maybe at the end of this, there is some sort of large policy cracked open by the people who are supposed to be leading us.”

But why, Ms. Oliver asked, could Israelis simply not allow Palestinians to leave Gaza and the West Bank to live alongside them?

Ms. Minkin, thinking back to decades of collapsed peace talks, thought that idea was unlikely. “Do you really think they want to live peacefully in Israel?,” she remembered responding.

Amid all the suffering in Gaza, Ms. Oliver said, why wouldn’t they?

Things Left Unsaid

Ms. Minkin tried to steer the conversation away from political history. She is no apologist for the current right-wing government and has always supported a two-state solution, she said.

But she wanted Ms. Oliver to understand how it felt to be Jewish in this moment. After centuries of antisemitism, many Jews like her feel existentially worried, afraid that the world could turn on them in a moment. The way Ms. Oliver described the Hamas attack read to Ms. Minkin like a justification for the murder of Jews.

“It was a massacre, and it’s hurtful to see anyone dismissive of it,” Ms. Minkin recalled saying, noting the deep connections between American Jews and Israel. “We’re all related to Israel in some way, first degree, second degree. We are one people, and we’re in pain.”

Ms. Minkin did not mention her own experience in Israel. She lived in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for years in her 20s, as bus lines were bombed and cafes were attacked. She attended the rally where Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister who led peace negotiations with Palestinians and shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994, was assassinated by an Israeli extremist. Israel, Ms. Minkin later thought, is a central part of her identity, a place that shaped her, a Jewish homeland she returns to frequently.

Both women left things unsaid.

Ms. Oliver did not speak about the personal history influencing her views. Her brother, Morgan, served for years in the Army in Afghanistan and struggled with post-traumatic stress before he died by suicide in 2017. She created the Morgan Oliver School to help honor him. The people who suffer most in wars, Ms. Oliver said later, are the poor and powerless — the soldiers who volunteer and the civilians who are considered collateral damage.

Feeling Seen

As she searched for ways to describe her own views, Ms. Minkin tried to emphasize her empathy for Palestinians. She noted that her sisters were both experts on the Middle East with close relationships with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.

Ms. Oliver nodded, but privately she recoiled. The comment reminded her of hearing white people say that they have a Black friend. “That doesn’t mean you are oppressed in any way at all,” she thought.

Both women agreed that the conversation became most fraught when it veered into the complexities of race in America."

It is important to reaffirm Israel’s right to defend itself, indeed its obligation to do so, and to take necessary steps so that Oct. 7 can never happen again. But it’s also very important the way Israel does that.” “It is our position that a cease-fire is imperative to deal with the consequences, the humanitarian consequences of this conflict. And we believe that dealing with the various components of this crisis should be dealt with as well in an appropriate manner. But it is the international community’s responsibility always to seek the cessation of hostilities and not to promote the continuance of violence and military activity that has a very dire impact on the well-being of the civilian population in a very restricted area.” “This is not a religious war. It’s not a war between Muslims and Jews. This is defined in its context and all our values — Muslim, Christian, Jewish. All other human values dictate that we work for peace and we stop this madness, and we do not allow for the very dangerous dehumanization that we see.”"
452,452,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/04/us/protests-israels-gaza.html,"Bearing flags and united in fury, tens of thousands of demonstrators crowded the streets of American cities on Saturday to denounce the scope and scale of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in response to last month’s terrorist assault by Hamas.

The day’s protests, within sight of the seats of American power in Washington but also in places like New York, Nashville, Cincinnati, Las Vegas and even Orono, Maine, extended and amplified demands for a cease-fire and an end to the siege in Gaza. The demonstrations came a week after vast protests in Asian and European capitals, and a day after the Israeli government appeared to rebuff the United States’ call for “humanitarian pauses” in the bombardment.

But Saturday’s demonstrators demanded far more than that, their chants in Washington thundering along Pennsylvania Avenue, their protest signs filled with messages like “Mourn the dead, fight like hell for the living” and “Let Gaza live!” Beyond a swift end to the siege that is exacting a swelling human toll, they also sought a shutdown of American aid to Israel, blending policy demands with anguish and ambition.

Some of the chants, most especially “From the river to the sea!” have been condemned as an antisemitic call for Israel’s destruction, though many protesters have defended the slogan as a cry for freedom.

The protests in the capital and elsewhere unfolded as public opinion surveys show support for Israel in its military campaign against Hamas, which the United States government considers a terrorist organization, but rising concern for Palestinian civilians. Roughly 1,400 Israelis were killed in the attack by Hamas, and more than 9,000 Gazans have been killed in Israel’s bombing campaign.

Saturday’s demonstrations also reflected the constellation of causes and groups that have long connected themselves to the Palestinian cause, including Black activists, student organizations, labor unions and antiwar and environmental groups.

Here is a snapshot of who took to the streets in four cities.

— Alan Blinder and Kayla Guo, in Washington

Cincinnati

The city’s Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, settled by German immigrants in the 1800s, was transformed into a swath of Palestinian support, with several hundred marchers clogging roads, shutting down intersections and chanting pro-Palestinian slogans under the watchful eye of a heavy police presence.

The rally and march brought together a disparate group of people. The event was organized by the Cincinnati Socialists, but it was heavily attended by Muslims, Black activists, college students and peace advocates.

Yasmeen Allen, 49, a Muslim who moved to Cincinnati from Iraq 26 years ago, said that the city’s Muslim population represented a diverse cross-section of countries, but there was one thing that united them: support for Palestinians. “The Muslim population has grown significantly in the 26 years I’ve been here, and it has grown more diverse,” Ms. Allen said."
453,453,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/04/opinion/sunday/palestinians-west-bank-israel.html,"When I was a law student backpacking through the Middle East in 1982, I met two Palestinian university students on a local bus in the West Bank. We got to chatting and they invited me to their homes, so I jumped off the bus and spent a day with them in the jumbled alleys of the densely populated Dheisheh Refugee Camp.

We had a good time together, for they told me about their Arabic studies at Bethlehem University, and I was then hatching a scheme to study Arabic myself in Cairo. We were all excited by education and full of youth and dreams. I wrote their names in my address book, but we never made contact again — until now.

After 41 years, I dug up my old address book and found their names. I wondered: Are they still alive? Have they moved abroad? At this grim moment, what do they think of Israel, Hamas and America?

With the help of a local reporter who called around at the Dheisheh camp, I was able to locate them: Saleh Molhem, now 63 and graying, and Mahmoud Qaraqei, now 60. One reason it was possible to track them down is that Palestinian refugees aren’t very mobile. Both were still living in the same refugee camp. They remembered me and invited me to pay another visit."
455,455,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/world/middleeast/rashida-tlaib-biden-israel-palestinians.html,"Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan and an outspoken voice for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, released a video on Friday that accused President Biden of supporting the genocide of Palestinians.

“Mr. President, the American people are not with you on this one,” Ms. Tlaib says in the video. “We will remember in 2024.”

After she speaks, the screen goes dark and a message appears in white lettering stating: “Joe Biden supported the genocide of the Palestinian people. The American people won’t forget. Biden, support a cease-fire now. Or don’t count on us in 2024.”

Ms. Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, has been on the leading edge of a group of progressive lawmakers criticizing Mr. Biden’s embrace of Israel since the attack by Hamas on Oct. 7, saying his actions have helped enable the deaths of Palestinian civilians in Israel’s response. She already beat back an attempt to censure her in the House this week over her comments on the war and is facing attack ads from a Democratic pro-Israel group.

But accusing Mr. Biden of supporting genocide marks an extraordinary broadside against the president by a lawmaker from his own party.

A genocide is defined as the deliberate and systematic killing of members of a particular ethnic, national, racial or religious group in order to annihilate that group. The Israeli military has said it is targeting Hamas, which carried out terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians, not the Palestinian people.

The language in the video threatens to widen an already tense fissure within the Democratic Party on the conflict, with pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli members of the party trading accusations of bigotry.

A White House spokesman declined to comment on the video.

Mr. Biden faces enormous pressure from those crosscurrents in the party as he has sought to stand with Israel — the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East, which last month saw the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust — and to help ease the suffering of Palestinian civilians as Israel pummels the Gaza Strip with airstrikes and a ground invasion.

The Biden administration has called for “humanitarian pauses” to allow aid to get to civilians and for more people to leave the Gaza Strip. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to have rejected that plea, saying any end to Israel’s military campaign would be contingent on the release of over 200 hostages Hamas abducted in the Oct. 7 attack.

Mr. Biden has also grown more critical of the Israeli government’s response as the death toll in Gaza has ballooned and the humanitarian crisis has deepened, even while declaring unambiguous support for Israel and its right to defend itself.

The video posted by Ms. Tlaib opens with a clip of Mr. Biden stating that the United States stands with Israel, before cutting to videos of Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip, children bleeding in medical tents, bodies lying in rubble and protests around the United States calling for a cease-fire.

One clip features a demonstration in Michigan in which protesters chanted “from the river to the sea” — a phrase used by pro-Palestinian groups that many regard as calling for the eradication of Israel.

The phrase, which the Anti-Defamation League calls an antisemitic slogan, refers to Palestinians reclaiming the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, which includes the state of Israel.

In a follow-up post on X, formerly Twitter, Ms. Tlaib wrote, “From the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.”

The video contained just the latest in a series of statements that have put Ms. Tlaib at odds with many in her party.

“As the Israeli government carries out ethnic cleansing in Gaza, President Biden is cheering on Netanyahu, whose own citizens are protesting his refusal to support a cease-fire,” Ms. Tlaib said on Thursday. “We must be laser focused on saving lives, no matter their faith or ethnicity.”

The House struck down a resolution on Thursday to formally rebuke Ms. Tlaib, with about two dozen Republicans joining Democrats in opposition. The resolution, which was brought by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, accused Ms. Tlaib of “antisemitic activity” and referred to an Oct. 18 protest in a House office building, in which Ms. Tlaib accused Israel of genocide, as an “insurrection.”

The explanation offered the first window into the kinds of details that were being negotiated with the leadership of Hamas, even as Israel began a campaign of airstrikes in response to the slaughter of 1,400 people and the taking of more than 200 hostages by Hamas terrorists in attacks on Israel on Oct. 7 launched from Gaza. Hamas rules Gaza politically and also has an armed wing whose fighters are embedded within the enclave’s civilian population.

People holding dual, U.S. or other foreign citizenship repeatedly gathered at the gate, at Gaza’s southern border, starting shortly after Oct. 7. But for weeks, the Rafah crossing remained closed. For most of that time, American officials said only that Hamas was preventing the departure of foreign nationals, and that the group was making unreasonable demands.

On Friday, a senior administration official provided more detail about those demands, speaking with reporters on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations. The official said that Hamas had repeatedly provided to Israel, the United States and Egypt lists of Palestinians who were wounded and should be allowed to depart with the Americans and others. But vetting showed that many of them, the official said, were Hamas fighters.

The official said that about a third of the wounded Palestinians on the first list were Hamas fighters and that allowing them to exit Gaza was unacceptable to officials in Egypt, the United States and Israel. The delays continued for some time, the official said, because Hamas kept offering lists that turned out to include its members.

Biden administration officials have said that the negotiations with Hamas for the release of Americans and other foreign nationals was indirect, and undertaken with the help of representatives of the government of Qatar, which has long maintained lines of communications with Hamas.

The official who spoke to reporters on Friday said that Hamas had eventually relented in its demands for the passage of its fighters. The prospect of Hamas fighters leaving Gaza was especially troubling for Egypt, which remains concerned about the possibility of terrorists flowing into its country.

Eventually, the official said, the parties settled on a list of wounded Palestinians who were not Hamas fighters. Those Palestinians who did leave were legitimately caught in the middle of the fighting, the official said.

The official said that negotiations with Hamas and Israel over the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza had also been difficult, but that it was now expected that about 100 trucks with aid would be entering Gaza each day."

Palestine TV, where Mr. Abu Hatab worked and which is run by The Palestinian Authority, said they were killed at home by an Israeli airstrike. On Friday night, the Israeli military said that after a review, it was “not aware of any military activity conducted by our forces in the vicinity of the location in question.”

Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, said that Mr. Abu Hatab’s wife, son and brother were among the dead.

The Committee to Protect Journalists said that more media workers have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war than in any other conflict in the area since it started tracking the data in 1992. As of Friday, 36 media workers — 31 Palestinians, four Israelis and one Lebanese — have been killed since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, the group said.

Photographs showed people searching through the rubble of the home on Thursday and Friday, unearthing relics of the family’s everyday life. At Mr. Abu Hatab’s funeral on Friday, dozens of relatives, friends and fellow journalists wept and prayed above his shrouded body. Atop it rested a blue flak jacket and a microphone."
458,458,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/opinion/gaza-israel-humanitarian-pause-ceasefire.html,"Four weeks ago, Israel began its military campaign to defeat Hamas, in retaliation for the attack on Oct. 7 that killed more than 1,400 people, kidnapped some 240 others and destroyed a fundamental sense of security for all Israelis. Israel has a right to defend itself against this threat at its border, and the United States, its closest ally, has rightly pledged to stand by its side until that sense of security is restored.

But the fight against Hamas is not a war against another nation, one that respects international law or the laws of war. Hamas is a terrorist group, one whose founding charter called for nothing less than the destruction of the Jewish state. “Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it,” the group’s founding charter says in its preface, quoting Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood. And while it may cling to the idea that it represents Palestinians, Hamas has shown that it has little regard for the lives of civilians in Gaza: Hamas militants have long hidden themselves in mosques and schools and hospitals, intentionally placing civilians in harm’s way.

People around the world, including in the United States, who have justified the attacks by Hamas would do well to understand exactly what this group continues to stand for.

This situation makes Israel’s fight against Hamas exceptionally difficult. As a liberal democracy, the only one in the Middle East, Israel has made a commitment under international law to protect Palestinian civilians while pursuing its military objectives. While it is true that Hamas has made no such commitment, Israel holds itself to a different, higher standard. It cannot allow anger and the desire for vengeance to undermine its moral obligations.

After weeks of airstrikes by Israel and the continued firing of rockets by Hamas, civilians in Gaza have paid a grave price. Thousands have lost their lives or suffered serious injuries. As reporters for The Times detailed, Gazans under siege “say there is a surge of severely injured children entering hospitals, doctors operating without anesthesia and morgues overflowing with bodies.” There are shortages of food, water and fuel needed to power everything from desalination plants to generators.

That is why so many of Israel’s allies, including President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have called for a humanitarian pause to see to the urgent and immediate needs of civilians. Restoring access to food and safe drinking water should be first priorities, as well as delivering medical supplies and other essential aid. Israel has expressed concern that aid will only be diverted to support Hamas, but it is worth trying to get it to the civilians who desperately require it.

While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far resisted them, those calls have grown louder and more insistent after Israel’s recent bombardment of the Jabaliya neighborhood in Gaza, which Israel said targeted Hamas militants located there. UNICEF, a children’s aid organization, described the damage as “horrific and appalling,” and it said in a statement that the attacks follow weeks of bombardment “that have reportedly resulted in more than 3,500 children killed.”

A pause in hostilities between Hamas and the Israel Defense Forces would not be, as Mr. Netanyahu declared recently, a surrender to terrorism, nor is a pause the equivalent of a cease-fire, as a White House official noted. Israel has warned that a blanket cease-fire would accomplish little at this point other than allowing Hamas time to regroup.

A humanitarian pause, in contrast, would give some relief to Gazan civilians and allow Israel to make progress on another key part of its objectives: the release of hostages. Two American hostages were freed during an earlier brief pause in shelling, and another pause, or a series of them, could allow more of the hostages still believed to be held by Hamas a chance at being returned to their families.

A humanitarian pause would also allow more of the millions of civilians who remain in Gaza an opportunity to move to relative safety until the hostilities end. The Rafah border crossing was opened earlier this week, allowing hundreds of foreigners, including dozens of Americans, to leave Gaza and enter Egypt.

For any such measure to be effective, both sides in this conflict must abide by it. Hamas would have to agree, through its interlocutors, to stop launching rockets at Israel. Arab countries in the region should also put pressure on Hamas to release all of its hostages, which include many women and children.

There is no guarantee that a humanitarian pause, particularly in a conflict with a terrorist group, will ensure the safe return of hostages or end the suffering of civilians. It is certain, however, that inaction will lead to more civilian suffering and may increase the risk that this conflict will spark a regional conflagration. Already, supporters of Hamas in the region and elsewhere are using the deaths of Palestinians to urge Hezbollah and other armed groups to join the fight against Israel — while absolving Hamas for its role in Gaza’s suffering.

Israel’s leaders have tried from the outset of this conflict to prepare their country for a long war, and a humanitarian pause is unlikely to change that fact. But it is a vital step to ease the burden on civilians in Gaza, and to allow international aid agencies, which are essential to life in Gaza, to keep functioning. Israeli officials have so far been willing to hear the concerns of allies who have pressed Israel to live up to its commitments to the laws governing conflict. Those laws are designed both to regulate conduct during hostilities and also to create a baseline of humanity for what follows."

463,463,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/israel-hamas-information-war.html,"The conflict between Israel and Hamas is fast becoming a world war online.

Iran, Russia and, to a lesser degree, China have used state media and the world’s major social networking platforms to support Hamas and undercut Israel, while denigrating Israel’s principal ally, the United States.

Iran’s proxies in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq have also joined the fight online, along with extremist groups, like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, that were previously at odds with Hamas.

The deluge of online propaganda and disinformation is larger than anything seen before, according to government officials and independent researchers — a reflection of the world’s geopolitical division.

“It is being seen by millions, hundreds of millions of people around the world,” said Rafi Mendelsohn, vice president at Cyabra, a social media intelligence company in Tel Aviv, “and it’s impacting the war in a way that is probably just as effective as any other tactic on the ground.” Cyabra has documented at least 40,000 bots or inauthentic accounts online since Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza on Oct. 7.

The content — visceral, emotionally charged, politically slanted and often false — has stoked anger and even violence far beyond Gaza, raising fears that it could inflame a wider conflict. Iran, though it has denied any involvement in the attack by Hamas, has threatened as much, with its foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, warning of retaliation on “multiple fronts” if Israeli forces persisted in Gaza.

“It’s just like everyone is involved,” said Moustafa Ayad, executive director for Africa, the Middle East and Asia at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. The institute, a nonprofit research organization in London, last week detailed influence campaigns by Iran, Russia and China.

The campaigns do not appear to be coordinated, American and other government officials and experts said, though they did not rule out cooperation.

While Iran, Russia and China each have different motivations in backing Hamas over Israel, they have pushed the same themes since the war began. They are not simply providing moral support, the officials and experts said, but also mounting overt and covert information campaigns to amplify one another and expand the global reach of their views across multiple platforms in multiple languages.

The Spanish arm of RT, the global Russian television network, for example, recently reposted a statement by the Iranian president calling the explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza on Oct. 17 an Israeli war crime, even though Western intelligence agencies and independent analysts have since said a missile misfired from Gaza was a more likely cause of the blast.

Another Russian overseas news outlet, Sputnik India, quoted a “military expert” saying, without evidence, that the United States provided the bomb that destroyed the hospital. Posts like these have garnered tens of thousands of views.

“We’re in an undeclared information war with authoritarian countries,” James P. Rubin, the head of the State Department’s Global Engagement Center, said in a recent interview.

From the first hours of its attack, Hamas has employed a broad, sophisticated media strategy, inspired by groups like the Islamic State. Its operatives spread graphic imagery through bot accounts originating in places like Pakistan, sidestepping bans of Hamas on Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter, according to Cyabra’s researchers.

A profile on X that bore the characteristics of an inauthentic account — @RebelTaha — posted 616 times in the first two days of the conflict, though it had previously featured content mostly about cricket, they said. One post featured a cartoon claiming a double standard in how Palestinian resistance toward Israel was cast as terrorism while Ukraine’s fight against Russia was self-defense.

Officials and experts who track disinformation and extremism have been struck by how quickly and extensively Hamas’s message has spread online. That feat was almost certainly fueled by the emotional intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian issue and by the graphic images of the violence, captured virtually in real time with cameras carried by Hamas gunmen. It was also boosted by extensive networks of bots and, soon afterward, official accounts belonging to governments and state media in Iran, Russia and China — amplified by social media platforms."
464,464,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/nyregion/mount-sinai-beth-israel-lower-manhattan-hospital.html,"If it goes through, the hospital’s disappearance would leave the residents of Lower Manhattan with few major medical institutions. The largest hospital that would remain to serve that area would be NewYork-Presbyterian/Lower Manhattan hospital, a small institution that has fewer than 200 beds. Beth Israel, by contrast, officially has some 696 beds, although far fewer are staffed and some days only a quarter of them are filled with patients.

Most of the large hospitals serving neighborhoods that include Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, Little Italy and Chinatown have been shuttered. In the last 20 years alone, Cabrini Hospital in the Gramercy Park neighborhood and St. Vincent’s Hospital in Greenwich Village have both closed.

“Lower Manhattan already has too few hospital beds, and the closure of Beth Israel will make that situation even worse,” said Lois Uttley, a longtime health care researcher and consultant who has tracked hospital consolidation and closures.

Just three years ago some hospitals were overwhelmed by a surge of patients during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. That was especially the case in Queens, where years of hospital closures left the few remaining hospitals, including Elmhurst, overwhelmed.

During the first deadly phase of the pandemic, Beth Israel cared for more than 1,700 Covid patients — 165 of whom died, according to state statistics."
465,465,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/world/middleeast/hezbollah-leader-address-israel-hamas-war-gaza.html,"Since the war in Gaza began after Hamas’s surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, people across the Middle East have feared it could set off a second war between Israel and Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia, and ignite a broader regional conflagration.

That is not Hezbollah’s plan, the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a widely anticipated address to his followers on Friday, his first public remarks since the start of the war. He warned, however, that Hezbollah’s forces were ready for anything.

Hezbollah, he said, was already doing what it set out to do: exchanging fire with a portion of Israel’s military to keep it tied up along the northern border with Lebanon, reducing the burden on Hamas.

“The Lebanese front has lessened a large part of the forces that were going to escalate the attack on Gaza,” Mr. Nasrallah said. “Some in Lebanon say that we are taking a risk, it’s true. But this risk is part of a beneficial, correct calculation.”

But he added that he was keeping Hezbollah’s forces prepared should hostilities with Israel escalate. “All the possibilities on our Lebanese front are open,” he said. “All the choices are available and we could resort to them at any time.”

Israel and Hezbollah have clashed repeatedly along the Israel-Lebanon border since the war began, targeting each other’s positions and killing combatants on both sides. Mr. Nasrallah’s address, which lasted more than an hour and repeatedly erupted into fiery crescendos, was far from a call for peace.

But it fit with analysts’ assessment that Israel and Hezbollah appeared to be calibrating their actions to avoid setting off a broader war. Mr. Nasrallah described Hezbollah’s objective as a controlled battle along the border aimed at sapping Israel's morale and resources.

That message was most likely a disappointment to Hamas, a Hezbollah ally that is also supported by Iran, some of whose leaders have called on their regional partners to do more in the fight against Israel. Israel, the United States and other countries consider both groups terrorist organizations.

During one of the most tense periods in the Middle East in recent years, though, Mr. Nasrallah’s speech offered a small measure of relief for many, that at least one powerful force was not seeking to plunge the region into even greater violence.

Hezbollah is a more powerful and sophisticated military force than Hamas, with tens of thousands of trained fighters, an arsenal of more than 100,000 rockets and a stock of precision-guided missiles that can strike sensitive targets deep inside Israel. Military analysts believe that the group may also have other military capabilities that it has yet to unveil.

Mr. Nasrallah is a highly respected figure inside a group that calls itself the “axis of resistance,” a network of Iranian-backed militias in several Arab countries that share an anti-American and anti-Israeli ideology and have come to coordinate their operations more closely in recent years. A decision by Hezbollah to launch a full-on war with Israel would most likely encourage attacks by an assortment of allied militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen.

During his address, which was live-streamed to large gatherings of Hezbollah supporters around Lebanon, Mr. Nasrallah lashed out at the United States for its staunch support for Israel, accusing President Biden of dishonesty in telling Israel that it had the right to defend itself but that it had to respect human rights.

“Empty talk! Hypocrisy!” Mr. Nasrallah boomed.

He also said the group was not intimidated by the two aircraft carriers that the United States had dispatched to the eastern Mediterranean, which could strike Hezbollah targets.

“Your fleets in the Mediterranean do not scare us and will never scare us,” Mr. Nasrallah said. “Your fleets that you threaten us with, we are prepared for them as well.”

Should the United States intervene directly in the war, Mr. Nasrallah said, it could expect attacks by Hezbollah’s allies on its military bases and other targets in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.

The U.S. military has said the carriers were sent to deter a wider regional war — a fear that has grown alongside mounting anger in Arab countries over the crisis facing Gazan civilians and the death toll in the strip, which has risen into the many thousands since Israel’s bombardment began. Israel has faced increasing international criticism over the dire conditions in Gaza, but has so far resisted calls for either a cease-fire or humanitarian “pauses” to help deliver aid.

Mr. Nasrallah praised the fighters from his and other armed groups in Lebanon, saying they were launching daily attacks on Israeli military positions and destroying communications infrastructure. Those attacks had forced Israeli civilians to flee and drawn Israeli military resources to the north so that they could not contribute to attacks on Gaza.

He acknowledged that the possibility of a regional war still existed, but said that it could be avoided if Israel halted its attacks on Gaza.

Thousands of Hezbollah supporters gathered to watch the speech on giant screens in locations throughout Lebanon. The largest site, in Beirut’s southern suburbs, was decorated with Hezbollah and Palestinian flags. Celebratory gunfire rang out when he appeared onscreen, and supporters chanted, “We are here for you, Nasrallah.”

Early in the speech, Mr. Nasrallah praised Hamas for carrying out the Oct. 7 attack, which included assaults on large groups of civilians and killed more than 1,400 people in Israel. The Hezbollah leader said that no battle was more justified from a religious, moral or humanitarian perspective than “the battle with these Zionists.”

He said that Israeli treatment of the Palestinians had gotten so bad that a “great event” had been required to restore the Palestinian cause as “the No. 1 issue in the world.”

In Beirut, Mohamad Sbeti, 40, fired a volley of celebratory gunshots into the air with a pistol after Mr. Nasrallah finished speaking. He said he would answer any call by Hezbollah to fight Israel.

“We don’t want war,” he said. “But if war comes, me, my two boys and my wife will go and fight.”

A driver who had grown poorer during Lebanon’s deep economic crisis in recent years, Mr. Sbeti was not overly worried about the vast damage that Israel could do to Lebanon in a new war.

“Why should I be afraid?” he said. “We have nothing to lose.”

466,466,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/opinion/israel-gaza-mass-migration.html,"In my Wednesday column, I wrote about the various unveilings and intimations of new alignments that have accompanied the Israel-Gaza crisis — with one reveal being the extent to which immigration is transforming European politics, forging a mass movement of Arab-Muslim protest that in turn may be driving European voters and even European elites toward the anti-immigration right.

However you react to that description, whether it inspires anxiety about assimilation or anxiety about xenophobia, it should be accompanied by a large reminding asterisk: This is only the beginning. That is to say, whatever you see happening in Europe now is just the initial stage of the defining world revolution of the 21st century — the rapid graying of rich countries (and soon, not-so-rich ones) joined to the great migrations from the more youthful regions of the world.

I want to recommend two windows into this incipient revolution. One is the first installment of a series from my newsroom colleague Declan Walsh about Africa’s “youthquake,” the surge in population growth that’s going to give the continent the world’s largest work force within the next decade — two out of every five babies born worldwide by the 2040s, at least a third of the globe’s 15- to 24-year-olds by 2050.

Along with Walsh’s reportage on the promise and peril of this boom for Africa itself, and some amazing photos from Hannah Reyes Morales, the piece is worth reading if you still need to be disabused of the notion that the 21st century will exactly resemble the prophecies of overpopulated doom from the 1970s, with teeming masses overwhelming resource-strapped countries everywhere. In fact, Africa with its youthquake is increasingly a global outlier; much of East Asia, Latin America and the Middle East have a median age that’s rising and converging with Europe’s and North America’s. And what’s most striking about Africa’s situation is not some general Malthusian crisis, but the geographic-demographic imbalance, the deep and inherently unstable divide between the African continent’s youth and poverty and the rich and aging European continent to the north.

That means the dilemma of the 21st century isn’t how Earth will feed an ever-growing population, but how the world will deal with a potential mass rebalancing of population via migration, an altered wealth-and-people equilibrium, in a world where technology is making the movement of peoples easier than ever. The hopeful way to view this transformation is as a win-win: “African countries have a vital resource that aging societies are losing: a youthful population,” is how Walsh puts it, and you can imagine the future as an acceleration in the exchange of resources, with younger African workers going north and sending remittances south to help boost the developing economies they leave behind.

But it won’t be that simple. For one thing, as you see already in European migrant preferences, migrants don’t necessarily want to go to every aging country; they want to get to the richest or most dynamic or most generous ones — better Italy and Spain than Bulgaria or Romania, better Germany and Sweden than Italy or Spain. So some aging countries, the not-as-rich ones, are likely to see continued emigration by their own young people (this is Ukraine’s dilemma, accelerated by war), rather than a simple replenishment by immigrants from Nigeria or Morocco or anywhere else. This may also be true in the Americas: As demographic decline sets in across Latin America (birthrates are well below replacement in several Latin American countries) you won’t necessarily see an end to northward migration; rather, the driven and ambitious will continue to try to reach the United States, and stagnation may set in or deepen in the countries that they leave behind.

Clearly, the richest countries will be able to replenish their populations with immigration across the 21st century — if they choose. But the anxiety of Europeans right now over their existing minority populations taking to the streets to protest for Palestine (or, it’s feared, for Hamas), and the punitive measures, like literal neighborhood demolitions, already being taken in countries like Denmark to try to break up immigrant enclaves, are just a foretaste of the political turbulence inherent in that kind of transformation.

Because, again, the scale of what we’re talking about, the interaction between migration pressures and low birthrates, is not mass immigration as we knew it 50 years ago. Here it’s worth reading a new paper by Paul Morland and Philip Pilkington, respectively a demographer and an economist, modeling Britain’s economic and demographic future. Britain had below-replacement fertility for about half a century, and it’s been relying on unprecedented immigration rates to supply younger workers — “by a very long way the fastest ethnic change the country has seen, not since the Norman conquests of the 11th century, but rather since the Anglo-Saxons arrived in the 5th century, or maybe earlier still.”

That’s what happened already, and it hasn’t prevented Britain from already slipping a bit into economic stagnation. (Here it’s also important to stress that when you rely on immigration for younger workers, it’s not a one-off solution: If your birthrates stay low, you have to keep finding new immigrants, because immigrants don’t all come as 18-year-olds; they themselves age and become retirees, their own birthrates converge with natives’, and they often bring their older relatives after them.)

What will happen, though, is something much more dramatic. According to Morland and Pilkington’s projections, if current birthrates hold in Britain, within 50 years, more than a third of the country’s population would need to be first-generation immigrants to keep the old-age dependency ratio around 40 percent. (A 25 percent ratio means there are four workers for every retiree; a 50 percent ratio, just two.) If birthrates slump much further, toward the dire level seen in a country like South Korea, to maintain a sustainable dependency ratio in the late 21st century, more than half of Britain’s population would need to be first-generation immigrants.

I don’t think you need to be especially pessimistic to regard that kind of transformation as incompatible with stable democratic governance. It’s among the reasons you already have the rightward shift in European politics and why immigration restriction will be a winning issue for the foreseeable future in many European countries.

But a rightward and anti-immigration shift without some novel source of people, Morland and Pilkington point out, yields the European equivalent of what we see already in Japan — a cultural preservationism linked to steady economic decline.

This is an alternative that some on the de-growth left and nativist right might explicitly favor. But I am very skeptical that simply choosing a stagnant preservationism will be sustainable for rich countries that aren’t islands off the northeast coast of Asia (and even Japan may yet be transformed). Europe is geographically adjacent to the African youthquake; it already has many channels for migrants to enter, along with substantial existing immigrant communities to help welcome them and immediate economic opportunities for new arrivals. Whatever migration’s potentially destabilizing effects in the longer term, there’s a reason even right-wing governments in places like Italy and Poland have struggled to make restriction stick.

It’s not that I think borders inherently can’t be enforced or that immigration can’t be restricted and redirected; clearly policy matters, as you can see just in the differences between the Biden administration and the Trump administration. But the circumstances of the 21st century are going to be highly unusual by historical standards, Europe’s situation is different from America’s, and I think conservatives and immigration restrictionists who imagine that it’s simply a matter of will are going find that even a much more right-wing continent will end up looking more like Morland and Pilkington’s scenario of rapid and destabilizing demographic transformation than like contemporary Japan.

There is, of course, another possibility, which is that dynamism could be restored by higher birthrates, a “more children” option, which would render immigration less economically necessary while perhaps also making substantial immigrant populations less threatening to natives and more easily assimilated.

The question of how you raise birthrates is one I’ve taken up before and will doubtless take up again (after I figure out how to increase the marriage rate, of course). But to bring this newsletter back, in a sense, to where it began, I’ll end here by quoting Morland and Pilkington: “The only country in the O.E.C.D. that has chosen the ‘more children’ option is Israel.”

This Week in Anti-Decadence

Despite the widely held belief that dementia is destined to rise exponentially as global populations age, experts believe that, in the developed world at least, the prospects of avoiding dementia are stronger than they were a generation ago. A study published in 2020, which drew together multiple pieces of research to track the health of almost 50,000 over-65s, showed the incidence rate of new cases of dementia in Europe and North America had dropped 13 percent per decade over the past 25 years — a decline that was consistent across all the studies. … Now, there are early signs that the same phenomenon may be emerging in Japan, a striking development in one of the world’s most aged populations, suggesting that the downward trend is becoming more widespread.

— Sarah Neville, “What Is Behind the Unexpected Decline in Dementia?” The Financial Times (Oct. 30)"
467,467,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/briefing/gaza-hospital-explosion.html,"Last month, a few days after the explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, I walked you through the debate over who was responsible. At the time, there wasn’t much evidence that outsiders could assess on their own. The dispute revolved around competing claims from Israel and Hamas.

But more evidence has since emerged. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain it.

The hospital explosion is important in its own right: It was the biggest news story in the world for days and sparked protests across the Middle East. The explosion also has a larger significance: It offers clues about how to judge the claims about civilian casualties that are central to Hamas’s war message.

My colleague Julian Barnes, who covers intelligence from Washington, describes the explosion evidence as falling into four categories — akin to four legs of a stool. Let’s look at each of them:

1. Videos of the air

The most complicated part of the evidence involves the various cameras that captured the sky above Gaza on the night of Oct. 17.

The Associated Press, CNN and The Wall Street Journal each analyzed one set of footage and concluded that a malfunctioning rocket from Gaza — presumably from Palestinian fighters — caused the explosion. Israeli and U.S. intelligence officials have made the same argument.

But an examination by The New York Times’s Visual Investigations team exposed flaws in the footage analysis. Times reporters used additional cameras to conclude that the projectile actually came from Israel — and did not land near the hospital, which means it couldn’t have caused the explosion. At least two independent analysts, as well as The Washington Post, agree. CNN, similarly, has since published a new article withdrawing and updating its original finding.

The Post’s analysis also explains that a separate video does show a barrage of rockets from Gaza, headed toward the hospital, just before the explosion. One of them could have been “a stray rocket launched by a Palestinian armed group,” The Post wrote. The Times analysis notes that Palestinian and Israeli forces were each firing weapons in the area around the time of the explosion.

Bottom line: The video evidence remains murky."

From “The New York Times,” I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict enters its darkest chapter in decades, both sides are evoking the same foundational moment in their past, the events of 1948. Today, I speak with David Shipler, the author of a book about the conflict and a Jerusalem Bureau Chief for “The Times” at a crucial moment in our understanding of 1948 about the meaning and the reality of what happened that year. It’s Friday, November 3. David.

david shipler

Hi, Michael.

michael barbaro

I really want to thank you for making time for us.

david shipler

My pleasure.

michael barbaro

So David, in this war between Hamas and Israel, it’s feeling extremely important to understand the meaning of 1948, the year when Israel declared itself a nation, was attacked by its Arab neighbors, and waged a war of independence that displaced Palestinians on a large scale. Right now, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is describing this current war as a second Israeli war of independence, a second 1948.

david shipler

Right.

michael barbaro

Palestinians in Gaza are invoking 1948 themselves to describe this current conflict, because of the potential for another massive dislocation from their homes.

david shipler

That’s right. Yes.

michael barbaro

But it feels like for any of these references, these claims and counter-claims, to really make sense, we need to understand why Palestinians, why Israelis, are invoking this year and what stories they tell themselves about what 1948 means. And then, of course, we need to understand what actually happened that year. And David, you arrived in Israel as the bureau chief there in the late 1970s. And so I’m curious, when you took this job, what were the ways that both Israelis and Palestinians talked about 1948?

david shipler

Well, when I arrived, there were two clashing narratives, not overlapping at all. And when you go to the Middle East, you see immediately how people are imprisoned by history, especially in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And I kind think of it as an arsenal of memory, that historical events that happen — and we’re in the middle of one right now — they get really chiseled in stone, in terms of the way people think about themselves and about their adversaries. And the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is full of these markers of history. 1948 is one of the most important ones — and what Israel calls its war of independence and what the Palestinians call Nakba, the catastrophe. I mean, the thumbnail sketch of what happened is that in May of 1948, Israel declared itself a sovereign state and immediately was attacked by a crescent of five Arab countries, which erupted into that war of independence, as Israel calls it. And that war created the kinds of upheavals that wars do. And every year, we can see the clash of historical narratives about this particular event vividly. Because Israel celebrates a double holiday, and Palestinians mark the event in a different way. So Israel has, first, a day of remembrance or a memorial day. And it is a somber day. A siren sounds. People pull over to the side of the road. People stop walking in the street, and they stand for a minute or so in honor of the fallen soldiers and those who died in terrorist attacks. And then, the next day is a day of celebration, the celebration of Israel’s independence. But on May 15 every year, the Palestinians do what Israelis do on their memorial day. They stand in mourning, silently, to remember that event. So that is the sort of graphic, dramatic illustration of how the two peoples remember that war of 1948.

michael barbaro

Well, describe the two conflicting, contrasting narratives.

david shipler

Well, the key of the Palestinian narrative is the idea that all of the Arabs who left what is now Israel during the 1948 fighting were deliberately expelled by Israeli forces. The numbers are roughly 700,000, and they fled into neighboring countries. The Israeli narrative, for many years, and certainly at the time I arrived, was that no Arabs were actually expelled by the Israeli forces. They left of their own accord, either to flee fighting, as people do in wars, or because Arab leaders advised them to leave, pending an Arab victory, after which they could return home. So the Israeli narrative is one of moral purity, because they were fighting for their existence as an independent state against Arab armies. And the Palestinian narrative was also one of moral purity and that they saw themselves as purely victims, being expelled deliberately by Israel from land they felt was rightfully theirs.

michael barbaro

And this is no small dispute — the narrative conflict that you have just described.

david shipler

No, it goes right into the present. In fact, right now, you see many Palestinians who have been urged by Israel to retreat south from northern Gaza to southern Gaza, summoning up this idea of displacement and worrying that they’re not going to be allowed to come back. It’s a current issue. And it translates into a yearning to return on the part of Palestinians.

michael barbaro

Right, a sentiment that we have heard over and over in talking to Palestinians in Gaza over the past few weeks.

david shipler

Yes. And I came across this years ago, when I was in the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza, a place which is being pummeled now by Israeli bombing. And I was sitting around with a few guys who were in their 20s, and a kid came in. He was a lanky boy of 12. And somebody asked him where he was from. Now, he had been born in the Jabaliya refugee camp, but he didn’t say that he was from there. He said, Barbarit, Barbarit. I said, I never heard of Barbarit. Well, hm, a couple of these guys kind of smiled and explained that it had been an Arab village up the coast that had been demolished, really, during the ‘48 war. And his parents and grandparents, as it turned out as we talked more, had left that village more than 30 years before at that point. And yet, this kid said that that was where he was from. That brought home to me how alive the yearning to return was and how Palestinian children were being taught that they were from Arab towns that had been emptied, or almost emptied. Some had been destroyed. Some had been converted into Jewish towns, places that now, given the circumstance, they could not return, because Israel would not let them. And yet, that was the dream — to go back to those places someday and live there again, perhaps in the beautiful way that their nostalgia and the family lore described where the orchards were more fruitful than, probably, in reality, where life was more peaceful than anything they had experienced and more prosperous. So that was the dream, and it still is. It still is.

michael barbaro

So what this boy’s answer to your very simple question tells us is not just how ingrained these narratives have become but how they are passed down, generation to generation. Like you said, this boy was not born in that town in Israel. He’s probably never even been there. But in his mind, that is the only conceivable answer to the question of what is home.

david shipler

That’s right. It’s an idea, and the idea is alive and well and very motivating for many Palestinians.

michael barbaro

When you arrive in Israel, are you finding comparable versions of an ingrained narrative there around what 1948 and the birth of Israel looks like?

david shipler

Absolutely. The narrative of the ‘48 war was a very noble story from the Israeli standpoint. Jews were refugees from pogroms and the Holocaust in Europe. They had come to their biblical land, where there had been a Jewish presence for thousands of years. And they had created a state. And their victory was to be celebrated and to be kept in their history and their memory as a time of great accomplishment, with all the moral purity that you could imagine. So there was no real questioning, in most of the population, about the virtue of the 1948 War. And the details of it were all kind of good. I mean, they treated the Arabs well. They were nice to them. They didn’t force them out. Some places, they even urged them to stay. In Haifa, there’s a story about that — that Arabs in Haifa were urged to stay, not to flee. And all of that — I mean, that’s all part of the Israeli narrative. I remember vividly a convention, a meeting, that was in Jerusalem — the first gathering of Holocaust survivors. They’ve had more since. And the theme was to pass the torch of memory to their children. Many of the Holocaust survivors had not talked about their experiences. The memories were too painful and too ugly to share with their children. And so they came, and their children came. And they did talk with them, and they wanted to talk about all their experiences with me, too. As I walked with a tape recorder through the convention hall they would flock around me, and they would pull me aside. And you know what the theme was that many of them wanted to strike in their accounts? The theme was resistance. We did not just go willingly like lambs to the slaughter. We resisted. And here’s how we did it. We carved out our zones of agency, so to speak. And that conformed with the Israeli idea.

michael barbaro

Of 1948?

david shipler

Of 1948. To create the state and to resist and to be strong. Jews were no longer going to be massacred, and they were no longer going to be slaughtered. They were no longer going to be gassed and imprisoned. They were going to fight back. They had the weapons. They had the will. They had the strength. We are here. This is where we will stay. We are not going anywhere. So this, to me, represents the core of the Israeli Jewish attachment to that history.

michael barbaro

OK, so these are the two very ingrained, seemingly immovable narratives that you’re absorbing in your time in Israel.

david shipler

Yes. That’s right. And when I first got there in 1979, I came with a sensitivity to how people can manipulate history. I had been in Moscow for four years, where I saw Soviet authorities do that distort history to suit their ideological preferences, their political ideas. And I got really interested in that whole subject how kids learned history in their schools, how the media portrayed it. So I was tuned in on that. And soon after I arrived in Israel, I got a call from a guy who said he wanted to meet me and talk to me about something. I said, who is this? He said, I can’t say. I said, well, what’s it about? He said, I can’t say. I said, I thought I’d left Moscow, where this kind of thing happened all the time. But I did meet with him. His name was Peretz Kidron, and he turned out to be the translator of Yitzhak Rabin’s memoir from Hebrew to English. And the translator gave me the manuscript. And he was very upset that the censorship committee, to which all former officials had to submit manuscripts, had deleted several paragraphs, which completely changed the Israeli narrative of the ‘48 war.

michael barbaro

Huh. Explain that. And just put into context who Rabin is.

david shipler

Well, Itzhak Rabin had been prime minister. But at the time, he was in the opposition. He had a lot of time on his hands, I think, and he wrote this memoir. And it was very detailed. It was a good memoir. And Rabin was commander of the Harel brigade of the Haganah. That is the Jewish forces in the ‘48 war. And as commander of the Harel brigade, in his description, he and Yigal Allon, who was later to become foreign minister, wanted to know what they should do about the civilian population in these two Arab towns near Tel Aviv — Lod and Ramle. They asked David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister of Israel, what should they do? And Ben-Gurion didn’t answer. Didn’t answer. And then, he finally took them outside and made a gesture with his hand as if to say, drive them out.

michael barbaro

In other words, drive them out. Expel them. Kick them off the land.

david shipler

That’s right. And here’s what Rabin wrote. “Driving out is a term with a harsh ring. Psychologically, this was one of the most difficult actions we undertook. The population of Lod did not leave willingly. There was no way of avoiding the use of force and warning shots in order to make the inhabitants march the 10-to-15 miles to the point where they met up with the Legion, meaning the Arab Legion.” And then, he goes on, and he says, “The inhabitants of Ramle watched and learned the lesson. Their leaders agreed to be evacuated voluntarily on condition that the evacuation was carried out by vehicles. Buses took them to Latrun, and from there, they were evacuated by the Legion.” And Rabin writes that some of the Israeli soldiers refused to do it and that psychological counseling had to be done for the Israeli soldiers afterwards. Because it was such a traumatic experience for them, not to mention for the Palestinians. Now, that was a complete reversal of the standard Israeli narrative, which was that at the time, no Arabs were deliberately expelled by the Israelis.

michael barbaro

Right. And this is a disruption of a very popular, widely held narrative, not just by some random soldier, but by Yitzhak Rabin.

david shipler

Yes. By Yitzhak Rabin.

michael barbaro

But of course, from what you’re saying, this translator tells you that that has been censored out.

david shipler

He says it’s been censored out. He gave me the manuscript. And of course, I didn’t the translator and how honest he was. So I figured I needed to confirm this. And so I called Rabin, and I went to see him. I had never met him before. This was the first time. I hadn’t been in Israel long. And I put a tape recorder on his desk. And he said, well, let’s do this on background. And I said, fine. But I do have one on-the-record question I have to ask you. And I told him about this account that I’d seen in the manuscript. And he said, well, I can’t talk about it. And I said, well, why do you think they cut it out? He said, I don’t know. I was surprised. Bingo. I had my confirmation. And then, he went on to say, with a little sardonic grin, I gave the censors things to do. I wrote about Israel’s nuclear weapons, for example. And I knew they’d cut that out. But I was surprised they cut this out.

michael barbaro

So in a somewhat roundabout way, Rabin confirms to you that he did write this account of expelling Palestinians in the 1948 War, that it was true, but that the Israeli government censored it out, which makes sense, given what you just said about how powerful these narratives are.

david shipler

Yes, that’s right.

michael barbaro

So what did you do with this information?

david shipler

Well, I wrote a story for “The Times,” and included in it the entire section of the manuscript that had been deleted by the censor.

michael barbaro

Huh.

david shipler

And I thought, well, this is going to make a big splash in Israel. There’s going to be a lot of comment on this. And Israelis are very introspective, and they’ll look at this and say to themselves, wow, this is quite something. I didn’t know this.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

david shipler

But instead, what happened was, it was a kind of muffled response. It was an effort to minimize the possibility that this really happened or to diminish its significance in terms of scope. That is, oh, a couple of towns —

michael barbaro

What you’re saying is, narratives don’t easily crumble.

david shipler

Narratives are very, very firmly embedded in people’s need to believe things. But what happened a couple of years later was that the foreign ministry declassified documents from the 1948 War. And an Israeli journalist-turned-historian, Benny Morris, mined those declassified documents in a thorough way and wrote a very significant book detailing the towns and villages from which Arabs were expelled, those from which people just fled of their own accord, perhaps, or to get out of the way of the fighting — all of that. So he managed to take the Israeli narrative and inject it with all of the complications and nuances that every war contains. But even though the fact that there were expulsions has been now documented, that doesn’t mean that the clash of historical narratives has been resolved. Not at all. Not at all. And so I became very interested in exploring what actually happened during that war.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. David, once the door opens to a reinterpretation of the narratives around 1948, and we get all this reporting and declassification of documents, and a kind of truer version of events emerges, what do you actually understand to have been the accurate story of 1948?

david shipler

Well, to go back a little bit before 1948, to set the stage, it’s important to understand, as Israelis will point out, that there was, basically, an unbroken Jewish presence in the Holy Land from biblical times. There were very intense religious communities in Jerusalem, in Hebron, now in the West Bank, in Safed in the Galilee. And in the 19th century, late-19th century, more Jews began to come from both Arab countries and from Europe, and also in accordance with a movement, a cause, an idea called Zionism, which was developed as the notion that there should be a Jewish state, independent, strong, on that ancient land. And at that time, that area of Palestine, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean, which is the land in dispute, was ruled by the British under a mandate that had been decided on by the League of Nations in the wake of World War I, when the Ottoman Empire was defeated.

michael barbaro

The predecessor to the United Nations.

david shipler

That’s right, the precursor to the United Nations — the League of Nations. So the British-ruled Palestine under that mandate. The Jews who came to live in that area in those years, before World War II even, encountered a mixture of reception by Arabs who had lived on that land for generations. They were not newcomers. And they were a mixed group, so to speak. I mean, there were Muslims. There were Christians. There were Druze, a religion that keeps its tenets secret. There were Bedouins, who are semi-nomadic. So it was a mixture of Arabs of different affinities and different family lines and not necessarily identifying themselves with the word, Palestinian. That identity, that label, developed later. But nevertheless, they were attached to their land — I mean, their birthplaces, their families’ birthplaces. And when Jews came in from Europe, many of the Arabs saw them as interlopers, aliens, colonialists, as they had seen the British — even though, for Israeli Jews, the notion that they’re colonialists, or were at that time, is very odd and foreign. Because it wasn’t that there were French who were in Algeria who could just go home, or Brits in India who could just go home. That was their home. That was their new home. They had no other place. And some of the Jews were mostly farmers at that point. I mean, they were forming kibbutzim, you know, were trying to find places on what they consider to be empty land. But in some cases, the land was grazing land. It might not have been cultivated, but it was used for grazing for goats and so forth. So the very presence was considered somewhat aggravating to some of the local Arabs, and that was not a welcome development from the point of view of many of the Arabs.

michael barbaro

So there was a Zionist movement, a push for a Jewish State, long before World War II and the Holocaust.

david shipler

Yes, that’s right. You know, World War II ended in 1945. 6 million Jews had been slaughtered by the Nazis. Many, many others had feared for their lives and become refugees. And internationally, there was a great sympathy for the Jews and for the idea that they ought to have a refuge, a homeland. And a natural homeland, according to the Zionists, was in the biblical lands. So in 1947, the United Nations passed a partition plan dividing that land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River into two states, an Arab state and a Jewish state.

michael barbaro

Take this British-controlled land, and basically give some to these Jews who were there and some to the Arab population that was there.

david shipler

That’s right, exactly. And if you look at the boundaries of that partition plan in 1947, it looks like a gerrymandered congressional district. But they basically followed the lines of the Jewish population in the area, and they left out of the Jewish state areas that were mostly Arab. But there was mixture on both sides. I mean, there were certainly Arabs in the parts that were designated as a Jewish state. What happened then was that the Jewish forces accepted the partition plan, and the Arabs did not. The Arabs within the area rejected it, and Arab countries rejected it. The Jews accepted this partition, from what I’ve read in history, because they felt fairly weak, militarily, and figured this was as good as they could get. And they were going to get a state. And I think there was a sense that the Arab countries thought that they were superior militarily and could easily defeat this ragtag army that was getting its weapons from Czechoslovakia, mostly. They did not get any weapons from the United States, by the way, at that time. The US was trying to stay out of it. You know, it had a little kind of skeleton of an air force, but it wasn’t going to be much of a foe, a real opponent. I mean, they could get rolled over. And I think that was probably the assumption at the time. And also, there was just, from inside, to the — local Arabs didn’t want this Jewish state either, because they were interlopers. They were Europeans coming in, foreigners, not indigenous to the land, and therefore, had no real right there. They were not accepting of that. And in May of 1948, the time at which the mandate by the British was to end, the British withdrew, and Israel declared its independence, and then was attacked.

michael barbaro

Instantly.

david shipler

Yes, that’s correct. Arab armies from Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, too, which sent a unit under Egyptian control, attacked. And the 1948 War began.

michael barbaro

And what happens once the Arab neighbors of this new nation of Israel attack?

david shipler

There was a lot of fighting, and the fight went on from May of 1948 until early in 1949. And the Israelis turned out to be stronger than the Arabs thought they would be. And they were effective enough to defeat the Arab armies and roll them back and actually expand the boundaries of what became Israel beyond what the partition plan had provided. Now, what they didn’t get at that time was the Gaza Strip, which was in the hands of Egypt. That remained in Egyptian hands. And they didn’t get the West Bank of the Jordan River, which was in the hands of Jordan and remained so until the 1967 war. And they also didn’t get all of Jerusalem.

michael barbaro

And David, now that we’re not just speaking about narratives but about established historical facts, what happens to the Arabs on the lands that are in question during this period when Israel is achieving these victories against these Arab countries?

david shipler

So it’s true that an estimated 700,000 Arabs left what is now Israel. And they did so for a variety of reasons. Some fled the way people do in war, which is just to avoid the fighting. And some fled because Arab leaders told them to get out, pending a victory by the Arab forces, after which they could come back. Some were expelled deliberately, as we now know, by Israeli forces. Some fled because they were afraid that they would be massacred. And there were massacres of civilians by Israeli forces. The most infamous was Deir Yassin, a village right on the outskirts of Jerusalem. And that was known before the declassification of Israeli documents. But once those documents became available, Benny Morris found about two dozen places where civilians were massacred. And that scared a lot of other Arabs who heard about them. And even where there was no violence or demands that they leave, people fled, because they were afraid that the Israeli forces coming in would massacre them.

michael barbaro

Right.

david shipler

So those are the reasons, the basic reasons. And what the Palestinian narrative has done is to put all of the departures in the category of deliberate expulsion. And that is an exaggeration. But all the other reasons that people left don’t really lessen the pain that has been passed down, generation to generation, by the Palestinians, which still animates their cause and fuels their desire to return.

michael barbaro

So not only did Israelis expel Palestinians, despite the narrative that they didn’t, some Israelis participated in the killing of Arab civilians during this conflict.

david shipler

Yes. And when all of this information is disclosed from these declassified documents in the archives, it reveals that the Israeli myth is just that. It’s a myth. It’s very sanitized. By the way, the Palestinian myth is also a myth. So you have this clash of narratives, which you could also call clash of myths.

michael barbaro

Right. So to that point, when we think about that Palestinian narrative, that claim inherited through many generations, that the 700,000 Palestinians who left Israel were expelled from their homes during the creation of Israel, the story you’re saying is more nuanced. It’s more complicated than that. In part because Israel was attacked and attacked back, and there’s an open war. Like you said, some Palestinians are leaving for fear of that war. Some are leaving because they are being expelled. Some are leaving because they fear that they could be expelled or, worse, massacred. And there’s no doubt that all forms of that kind of dislocation have to be wrenchingly painful. But in a conflict where the details matter and are constantly being litigated, the historical record, from what you’re saying, makes clear that not all 700,000 Palestinians were expelled forcibly by Israel, as a matter of policy. It might be more accurate to say that many of these Palestinians had to leave their homes as a result of a war.

david shipler

I think that puts it very well, yeah. I mean, there are lots of reasons that people left. The war at the core of it, of course. And it’s pretty ugly, war is. Terrible things happen, and they did in 1948. Now, in some places, they were allowed to come back. But most of the Arabs who left or were driven out during the ‘48 War were never allowed to return to their homes inside what is now Israel. It’s probably worth noting also that many Arabs did not leave, and stayed in Israel, and now, they and their descendants make up about 20 percent of Israel’s population.

michael barbaro

So David, at the end of the 1948 War, when Israel emerges victorious, what does the world look like for both of these peoples is rallies as well as Palestinians who have, through a combination of expulsions and flight, are not on their lands?

david shipler

Well, at that point, Israel was trying to build up their resilience and build up their economy and fulfill their dream of building a Jewish state. And it wasn’t just Palestinians who were displaced. Many Jews living in Arab countries were expelled by those countries and fled of their own accord sometimes. Most ended up in Israel, and the results of that population shift are seen in Israel today, where at least 1/2 of the population are now descended from Jews who lived in Arab countries.

michael barbaro

And the Palestinians?

david shipler

Well, the Palestinians were scattered into a diaspora in many countries around the world. But the bulk of them, at least at first, ended up in refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, which controlled the West Bank at the time, and in the Gaza Strip, which was under Egyptian control. So that diaspora, so to speak, which ended up in the refugee camps, is still conscious of its origins and has passed down, through the generations, the story of displacement.

michael barbaro

David, why wasn’t there a creation of a Palestinian state after Israel’s victory? Because there are still these people who had been promised, through the partition, a country, just as the people of Israel have been promised a country. Why didn’t a Palestinian state emerge in the aftermath of this war?

david shipler

Remember that this was a war not between the Palestinians and the Israelis. This was a war between Arab countries and the new state of Israel. So at the end of the war of ‘48, armistice agreements were signed that established the borders of Israel. And what wasn’t Israel was Arab states. So there was no talk that I’m aware of creating a so-called Palestinian state. I don’t know that the concept was in the conversation at that point. Through the years, despite lip service given to the Palestinian cause by Arab leaders, their interest in supporting that cause has been — aside from being rhetorical, has really been wanting. The Palestinians were not accepted as citizens, by and large, in the Arab countries where they fled. Palestinians have been victims of the Arab world as well as of the Israelis.

michael barbaro

And what is life like for these Palestinians as refugees in the period after the war?

david shipler

The population was very impoverished. The refugee camps began as tent camps. They’re still called camps, although that’s a misnomer. They’ve become established slums. The poverty rate is still fairly high. It’s very difficult for Palestinians to have a comfortable and prosperous life when they’re confined to the camps. And lots of Palestinians have left the camps and been able to emigrate to various countries in Europe, the United States. And so those folks are doing better. But it’s not so easy to get the visas. It’s not so easy to accumulate the money to make that change. And there’s an ideological resistance to doing it, too. I remember at one point, when I was there, Israel wanted to build housing outside refugee camps in Gaza, and the local Palestinians rejected the idea vehemently. Because they thought it was an effort to undermine their status as refugees to, basically, do what’s now called normalize the occupation. So there’s a whole history of attempting to keep alive the idea of displacement, the refugee status, and the yearning to return.

michael barbaro

And from the Israeli point of view, the idea of return for these Palestinians represents what?

david shipler

A threat to the existence of the Jewish state, for two reasons. One, the Jews would be outnumbered by the Arabs in the voting rolls. Right now, if you take the West Bank and Gaza and Israel proper altogether, and East Jerusalem, the population division is about even, maybe even slightly tipped toward the Arab side. So if it opened pluralistic, fair, free democracy, Arabs would outvote Jews. So that’s one issue. The other is the security concerns. I mean, we’ve just seen it in the Hamas attacks, where Israeli Jews were attacked in their homes and their kibbutzim. And the notion that lots of Palestinians would be allowed to come in and live inside Israel terrifies Israelis.

michael barbaro

David, we’ve spent a lot of time here, trying to understand narratives and reality. But the more time you spend understanding 1948 and the context surrounding it, it seems the thing that becomes very clear is that Palestinians and Israelis emerged from it with a strong claim to being victims. Israelis are victims of Arab countries seeking Israel’s destruction at the moment of its birth and the forces of anti-Semitism that led to the Holocaust and, in the minds of so many Israelis, necessitated Israel in the first place. Palestinians are victims of the war that results from Israel’s creation, including Israeli tactics that forced many of them from their homes and, later, by the rejection that Palestinians faced from their Arab neighbors. And the fact that Israel won the war and Palestinians and their allies lost doesn’t really change their view of themselves as victims.

david shipler

Exactly right, Michael. Exactly right. They are both victims. I remember an Israeli telling me once, when you put two victims together, it’s like mixing fire and kerosene. Neither side recognizes the other’s victimhood, although you have to say that there are some Israelis who do see the Palestinians as victims, even of the ‘48 War. After the declassification of documents showing that there were expulsions of Arabs, that fact worked its way into some Israeli textbooks at the university level, and then also at the secondary school level, to an extent. I think Israelis have come to see that there were such expulsions, and there were injustices, but that has not overcome the sense of great pride and accomplishment in creating the state through that war of independence. And there are some Palestinians who see Jewish victimhood. But when they speak publicly about it, they get themselves into trouble. There was a professor at Al-Quds University in Jerusalem who used to teach a course on the Holocaust to Palestinian college students, and he actually took them to visit Auschwitz. And he got them to see Jews as victims and understand the historical roots of their arrival in this place, this Holy Land. And what happened to him? He was threatened, and ultimately, he was fired. So the obstacles to seeing the other and recognizing what the other has gone through are immense. They’re immense. So we have here a conflict between two peoples who are victims of each other, but not only of each other, also of the larger world.

michael barbaro

Right. And in this case, how you understand the conflict and how you understand the whole question of victimhood depends very much on where you start the clock, where you think the story begins.

david shipler

Exactly right.

michael barbaro

David, thank you very much. We really appreciate it.

david shipler

Thanks for listening.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the doomed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was convicted on all charges of fraud and conspiracy on Thursday after a month-long trial that exposed the hubris and risk-taking across the crypto industry. The conviction puts Bankman-Fried in league with the biggest financial fraudsters in history. Overall, his victims lost nearly $10 billion in funds, and he now faces a sentence of up to 110 years in prison. And on Thursday, the Israeli military said it had encircled Gaza City and was waging close-quarters combat with Hamas as they pushed forward with what Israeli officials have predicted will be a long and bloody ground invasion. Meanwhile —

wafa al-saqqa Good morning from Rafah. I just arrived to the crossing. They’re going to start calling people. I know my name is on the list, but I don’t know when I will enter.

michael barbaro

The evacuation of foreign nationals and wounded Palestinians from Gaza into Egypt entered its second day on Thursday. Among those leaving was Wafa Al-Saqqa, the subject of a “Daily” Episode on October 16. When the war broke out, Al-Saqqa, an American citizen who had grown up in Gaza, became trapped in Gaza where she was visiting family.

wafa al-saqqa (CRYING) I’m glad that I’m going to go and meet with my grandson and my husband and my boys and their wives. So —

michael barbaro

At 1:30 PM local time on Thursday, she crossed into Egypt, then boarded a minivan, with other Americans, bound for Cairo.

wafa al-saqqa (CRYING) I don’t know how I feel. I left my whole family behind. Needed my help, but I couldn’t help them. But I need to go to my other family, too. I don’t know why we have to choose.

From New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.” So I want to start today with a question I’ve been getting, which is why I’ve been treating Israel as the primary agent here. To quote one email, “All you can do is condemn the brutality of the bombing. Well, guess what? You want to stop the bombing? Release the hostages now, and maybe, maybe something will change. You want fuel and electricity in Gaza? Tell Hamas.” Or here’s another email. Are you planning an episode called, “If not this, then what should Hamas have done?” After all, you had an episode on what should Israel do. It makes sense to take the exact perspective on Hamas.” I get where this is coming from. I really do. There would be no invasion of Gaza right now, no massive air bombing campaign, no siege of food and water, if Hamas hadn’t butchered more than 1,400 people in Israel and taken hundreds more hostage on Oct. 7. They did this. It should be on them to end it. Ghazi Hamad, a Hamas official, went on Lebanese television the other day, and he said, quote, “We will do this again and again. The Al-Aqsa Flood is just the first time, and there will be a second, a third, a fourth.” That is truly monstrous. Israel is right — I’ve said this before — to want to destroy Hamas, or at least destroy the threat that it poses. Every country in the world would want the same in its position. But if you agree with what I just said — that Hamas is truly monstrous, that there is something truly chilling about an organization that will slaughter Israeli civilians and then hide among Palestinian civilians — then there is some dissonance between the desire to treat Hamas as the brutal organization that it is and also to say that every Palestinian in Gaza should be dependent upon that same immoral terrorist organization making humane, decent decisions. That Israel is seen as, at least, potentially, a moral, restrained actor here is a strength. Israel’s weakness, or one of its weaknesses, is how much of that reputation it gave up in recent years. The Netanyahu administration has spent the last decade coexisting with and even strengthening Hamas because that weakened the more moderate Palestinian Authority. They spent that decade annexing territory in the West Bank. As Bezalel Smotrich, the current finance minister, said in 2015, “The Palestinian Authority is a liability, Hamas is an asset.” That’s one reason so many Israelis are so furious, so properly furious, at the Netanyahu government right now. But one thing Israel and Israelis have is a benefit of complexity. Even though the Netanyahu administration won its power in elections, we understand that it is not synonymous with Israelis, and that distinction is proper. But I don’t think that the American conversation, at least, always extends that same complexity to Palestinians. I want to go back to that interview with Ghazi Hamad, the Hamas official. After saying that Hamas wants a second, third, fourth Al-Aqsa flood, he says, “Will we have to pay a price? Yes, and we are ready to pay it. We are called a nation of martyrs, and we are proud to sacrifice martyrs,” end quote. One wonders whether so many Gazans want to be sacrificed as martyrs by Hamas. There have not been elections in Gaza in almost 20 years. The polling we have shows that Gazans dislike and distrust Hamas, but I think Palestinians are much more often spoken of, at least in America, as an undifferentiated mass. Their support for Hamas is often assumed, which is one reason I think so many are willing to hold them collectively responsible for what Hamas does. One intention I have for my coverage here is to hold true the humanity and the complexity of both sides. Except for in some truly lost parts of the left or the anti-Semitic parts of the right, I don’t think that’s a problem Israelis face in America. I do think it’s a problem Palestinians face. So I asked Amaney Jamal, Dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, on the show. Dr. Jamal is Palestinian. She spent much of her childhood in Ramallah. And she is also one of the leaders of the Arab Barometer Project, which, among other work, has been doing deep survey work on Palestinian public opinion. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. [MUSIC PLAYING] Dr. Amaney Jamal, welcome to the show.

amaney jamal

Thank you so much, Ezra, for having me.

ezra klein

So we’re talking — today is Tuesday, Oct. 31. When was your last survey in Gaza conducted?

amaney jamal

Our last survey in Gaza was conducted at the end of September through Oct. 6.

ezra klein

So it wrapped one day before Hamas’s attack.

amaney jamal

Yes.

ezra klein

That is wild.

amaney jamal

It’s very wild. We had a couple of responses on Oct. 7, but we had primarily wrapped up the work on Oct. 6.

ezra klein

So I want to go through some of the main results. And one thing you did was you polled attitudes on Hamas. What did you find in Gaza, and what did you find in the West Bank?

amaney jamal

So, generally, in Gaza, what we found is that trust for the Hamas government was low. It seems to be on the decline. So we found about 67 percent said they had no trust or little trust in Hamas. Furthermore, when we asked people about if elections were held today — as you know, Ezra, elections have not been held in the Palestinian territories since 2006, so for almost 20 years now. But when we asked people if elections were held today, who would you vote for? What we also found is that about a quarter said that they would vote for Ismail Haniyeh, who is the leader of Hamas, in a presidential election. Mahmoud Abbas did not receive very high scores either. So the Palestinian Authority, it appears, also doesn’t have great legitimacy. And when we asked people in Gaza who is their preferred party, 27 percent said Hamas, which is lower than a third, closer to a quarter, and then 30 percent said they would favor Fatah, which is also less than a third. So, again, it appears that both Hamas and Fatah do not enjoy great support or popularity among the citizens in Gaza. In fact, what we found is that a good percentage of citizens in Gaza have little faith in either of the political parties.

ezra klein

So if they don’t want the leaders of Hamas or Fatah to represent them, who was the most popular choice for leadership?

amaney jamal

So the most popular leader, but not by a great margin, is Marwan Barghouti, who is in an Israeli prison for his terrorist attacks on Israeli citizens.

ezra klein

And what do they like about him?

amaney jamal

So despite his atrocious sort of track record with Israelis, he is perceived to be a leader that lacks corruption, a leader that, if given the chance, would lead the Palestinian people honestly and favorably. We really don’t have much of a record of that. So Marwan Barghouti has never really held an official public office in the way of representing the Palestinian people. So this is, nevertheless, a perception that he would rule honestly and would have a government that wasn’t very corrupt.

ezra klein

This gets at something that I saw in your polls, that I saw in other polls I looked at of Palestinians both in the West Bank and Gaza, which is that I think in America, we think about the dominant, maybe even the only issue, as being the relationship and the conflict with Israel. When you look at the polling, corruption is often the top issue. And corruption is, I think, often believed to be why Hamas won in Gaza in 2006 in the elections that did happen. Now, Hamas is seen as incredibly corrupt. Corruption does seem to be at least the top domestic issue.

amaney jamal

That is correct, Ezra, and that’s a really good point to discuss with your viewers, which is that the average Palestinian on a day to day is not only assessing the condition of their livelihood vis a vis the Israeli occupation, but they are also juxtaposing their perception vis a vis the governing authority. So in the West Bank, that is the Palestinian Authority. In Gaza, it is the Hamas-led government. And on both ends, Palestinian perceptions of corruption are very high. And among Palestinians, especially because there’s this discourse and there’s this feeling that they’ve already been disadvantaged by the Israeli occupation and by an international community that, more or less, has been silent on the occupation, that to add insult to injury, Ezra, you then get governing authorities that are also corrupt, that are also dispossessing Palestinian people of their material well-being. And this is just, again, a deep wound for the Palestinians to have to live and contend with levels of corruption. So we see this in our polls, and we see this in our interviews and our focus groups that it’s just like yet another layer of injustice. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

One thing I was thinking about when reading the poll was the way that Palestinians are discussing their situation internally and the way that their relationship with Hamas is seen, particularly from Gaza, externally. And I want to read you something that Israeli President Isaac Herzog said about Palestinians in Gaza right after the attacks. And he said, quote, “It is an entire nation out there that is responsible. It’s not true, this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved. It’s absolutely not true. They could have risen up. They could have fought against that evil regime.” So how do you think about that?

amaney jamal

So I mean, that is just really, with all due respect, Ezra, as an analyst, is it’s just really inaccurate. We know that Hamas leads in a very dictatorial fashion in Gaza. We know from the poll that 40 percent said that the freedom of expression in Gaza was guaranteed to a great or moderate extent, which means about 60 percent did not believe the freedom of expression was guaranteed. And then about close to 70 percent believe that the right to participate in a peaceful protest was not protected under Hamas rule. So increasingly, Palestinians in Gaza, at the eve of these atrocious attacks, were feeling that their freedoms and the ability to express their opinion was limited, to express their opposition to the Hamas government was limited. In Gaza and elsewhere, even on the West Bank, it’s increasingly become common to hear of stories where Palestinians oppose the leaderships, and they are arrested for criticizing the government. So you have a population that is basically under this Israeli occupation, but then living under authoritarian rule of their own leaders. And then the world community or President Herzog basically saying, well, they’re going to be held responsible for what Hamas did. That is just inaccurate. That does not reflect the realities on the ground. And Hamas has not been representative of the Palestinian people. Everybody keeps basing the Hamas popularity on the 2006 election, Ezra, which you mentioned. And remember, the 2006 election, even if it brought Hamas to power, that election never was based on a landslide for Hamas. Hamas secured 44 percent of the popular vote in that election. And to your point, a lot of that vote was mobilized on ending corruption of the P.A.

ezra klein

One thing that is striking to me across every poll I can find is Abbas, who I think is often considered fairly moderate, at least for this conflict, is almost unfathomably unpopular. Why?

amaney jamal

I mean, it’s not only that he’s unpopular. 52 percent of Gazans believe the P.A., the Palestinian Authority, which is led by Mahmoud Abbas, is a burden on the Palestinian people. And 67 percent in Gaza would like to see Abbas resign. So these are horrendous polls in terms of thinking about what alternate leaders are there for the Palestinian people. But here’s the issue. Yes, the Palestinian Authority is very corrupt. It’s been well documented, Ezra. I’ve written on this in my book “Barriers to Democracy.” Having said that, if you go back to 1993 and after that, the whole creation of the Palestinian Authority was to bring Palestinian people an aura of autonomy and independence in a two-state solution that stood side by side with Israel. And year in and year out, what’s happened since Oslo is that the Palestinian Authority increasingly became a governing authority that was governing much more authoritatively while being seen as unable to bring any of the building blocks of building that Palestinian state, moving that peace process forward. Settlements have expanded. If you go to the West Bank, if you visit the West Bank year in and year out, Ezra, you’ll see that the land of the West Bank has shrunk, and it is divided, where you can’t travel between towns. And all the while, the Palestinian Authority is governing more authoritatively in these small enclaves on the West Bank. So that has been a disastrous formula for Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority, is the fact that before their very eyes, Palestinians have seen even further dispossession. The idea of a two-state solution, although, on a personal level, I have always supported and still support, I understand that it’s very difficult to talk about a two-state solution right now because the realities on the ground have changed drastically, to the extent that it’s very unclear about whether a two-state solution is even possible. And the truth is, Ezra, you can’t blame the failure of the peace talks on Mahmoud Abbas and the P.A. So we can talk about the corruption. We can talk about authoritarian rule. But the failure of the peace process, you cannot lay that responsibility on the doorsteps of the Palestinian Authority. The truth is, Israel, for the longest time, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, has chosen not to engage in a peace process, has chosen not to work.

ezra klein

I don’t think there’s any doubt that Netanyahu has done almost everything he could to not have negotiations in a serious way with Abbas. And in fact, I mean, it has been well reported and well discussed that part of the way that he engaged with Hamas was meant to weaken the Palestinian Authority, so he didn’t have to make those kinds of concessions. But I do want to ask here that one thing I will often hear from Israelis is that there have been opportunities. And part of the reason they have given up on the two-state solution is their sense that those opportunities were not taken, including by Abbas. And the specific one I often hear about is an offer made by Ehud Olmert, sort of towards the end of his administration. And I’m always so careful when I wade into this because the claims and counterclaims are very complicated. But there was some kind of offer from Olmert, and the details on it differ between the two camps, that in his telling, at least, it was more land than had been offered before. And the feeling was that Abbas did not respond, although, again, that is contested by Abbas’s camp. But I’m curious what you make of that sort of moment right before Netanyahu comes in and the whole politics of this changes.

amaney jamal

So this is a good point, Ezra, and like you, I have heard from my Israeli friends and colleagues who were involved in the track two negotiations and from the Palestinian side, and quite honestly, you will get accounts that say, yes, this was offered, but it was never put in writing. Or this was never offered, but they say it was. Or the Israelis are still talking about being afraid of the Palestinian right of return, that there was actually significant movement on that in the negotiations. So you’re always hearing the conflicting sides. But the truth is, this ongoing narrative around peace, which is that everybody has this one opportunity to either take it or leave it. And if people didn’t take it or they couldn’t come to that agreement, it means that we’re never going back to the negotiation table. And I’ve given this so much thought, as you can imagine. The real argument can be, should be, is that so much progress was made at Camp David. So much progress was made maybe with the Olmert plan. And then so much progress was made with what Mahmoud Abbas and the P.A. were willing to accept. Why did we not build on those successes? Because every time, Ezra, there were political forces that did not want peace. They did not want further concessions. They did not want the negotiation and, basically, the ability to come up with a resolution of compromise. These leaders would take us back. So rather than the discourse always focusing on the fault of the peacemakers who are really doing the hard work, I think we need to start asking our questions about the leaders who came and destroyed the peace process. The leaders who came and said, we don’t want peace. We don’t want to work with the Palestinian Authority, and we’d rather work with Hamas. That’s where the focus and the scrutiny should be. I think the peace process has been vilified because there were always groups and leaders who didn’t want peace. But the Olmert’s of the world, the Ehud Barak’s, the even Yasir Arafat, Mahmoud Abbas, and the P.A., the concessions that the world was willing to make or these leaders were willing to make, the heroic concessions, the courageous concessions, the concessions that Yitzhak Rabin, before he was assassinated for his concessions, right, that they were willing to make to bring peace, why are these efforts vilified and always put in this very negative framework, rather than saying, oh, my God, so much progress was made. You’ve had the recognition of the state of Israel. You had the denunciation of terrorism by the Palestinians. You had the willingness of land swaps to keep some of the settlements on the West Bank. You had security arrangements and security agreements, where there were joint security patrols patrolling a lot of the areas between Israel and the West Bank. There was a lot of cooperation, not only on security, but health and education and the economy. This was an enormous amount of work for coexistence and for mutual peace. And it was discarded, Ezra, under the guise of, oh, they couldn’t just agree at this one meeting on something. So what? Let’s have another meeting. Let’s have another effort. Which world leaders, since the failure of Camp David, have tried to seriously bring the Palestinians and Israelis together to push this two-state solution forward?

ezra klein

I do think you’ve seen a couple of people try. There were some very ill-fated attempts from John Kerry under Obama when he was an envoy on this. The Trump administration, I think, moved to an idea that you could make peace between Israel and other Arab nations, and you didn’t have to do anything with the Palestinians at all. There wasn’t very much happening under Joe Biden. But I think one reason this has begun to rot is a sense that it’s impossible, both for the reasons you lay out, that there are many more settlements now on the ground, that the two sides are further apart, but also that people don’t want it, that the polling, the public, has turned against it. And you did do polling on this in Gaza. So I wanted to ask what Gazans in your survey said about how they wanted to see the conflict resolved, what solution they were in favor of.

amaney jamal

Yeah, so we asked people in Gaza of the three solutions — a two-state solution that recognizes Israel and is based on the 1967 borders; a second option of a confederation between Israel and a future Palestine; and the third option being a one-state solution. And that’s the one-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians would all live in one state, enjoy equal opportunities. Now, Ezra, there was a fourth option that was other, that people could basically write in any other option. About 20 percent opted for that other option, and they opted for armed resistance against Israel. But that was only 20 percent. A majority supported the two-state option.

ezra klein

So I have some questions about this. So you did this poll in conjunction with the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research. And so I was looking at some of their other recent polls, and they seem to show very, very different results. So this poll, as you mentioned, done in Sept. and Oct.. They had a June 2023 poll that found, quote, “Support for the concept of the two-state solution stands at 28 percent, and opposition stands at 70 percent.” So what should I make of the difference between these two results?

amaney jamal

So this is really good question, Ezra, and I’m glad that you asked it, because we did spend a lot of time before we wrote up our results. We looked at the Palestinian survey that you just cited. So that survey generally was sort of framed around the failure of Oslo almost 30 years later. So that’s the general tenor of that survey. So there’s a series of questions in that survey that highlight the failure of the two-state solution, the failure of the peace process, and the failure of Oslo. So what we say, what we are sort of arguing, is that the Palestinian sample of this particular survey was basically fed different primes to put them in a very negative framework about the two-state solution. And I’m not saying that was the intention of the Palestinian Center. We work with them. Khalil Shikaki, somebody we hold in very high regard as a colleague.

ezra klein

He’s the head of the center.

amaney jamal

Yes, but here’s Q33, question 33. President Abbas made a speech at the U.N. in which he described the evolving conditions in the West Bank as a one-state reality with two peoples, the Palestinian and Israeli, and describe it as a reality of apartheid. He emphasized that if the Israeli occupation is not ended, the Palestinians will demand equal rights and a one state for two people. Are you for or against a one-state solution where the two sides enjoy equal rights? That’s Q33. Then Q35, it asks, do you support or oppose the solution based on an establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, known as the two-state solution? So after you’ve told them that they’re living in apartheid, after you’ve told Palestinians that their President Abbas says they’re living in apartheid, and more or less, a two-state solution has failed, Q35 comes after to say, do you support that? So in other words, the survey was not necessarily about a straight up, do you support a two-state solution? The survey was more about, do you believe a two-state solution is even viable, given that your president says you live under apartheid? Does that make sense?

ezra klein

It does. I mean, I will say that I looked across a couple of surveys. So I take your point that that survey was about the failure of the Oslo Accords. There’s another survey from December 2022 that shows that given force options of what should happen next in the conflict, 31 percent of Palestinians choose reach a peace agreement. But 40 percent choose wage an armed struggle against Israeli occupation. And my point is not that one is right and one is wrong. I feel like what you’re saying is, in some ways, more interesting than that, that if there is so much malleability in public opinion among Palestinians — and for that matter, among Israelis, which also changed in different surveys — if there’s so much malleability in Palestinian views on what should be done here depending on how questions are asked and questions are primed, that also implies actually quite a lot of malleability, potentially, in reality, that how people might feel about the peace process in one context, right, one way, one moment in the conflict, one administration they see in Israel, one way of being treated, and how they feel in another, could change very dramatically such that it sounds to me that the takeaway from this would be should never really see the opinion here as fixed.

amaney jamal

I think that’s a good way to put it, Ezra. Or more importantly, let’s just put it this way — and I’m not an expert on Israeli opinion, but I have colleagues working on Israeli opinion — is that the average citizen in Palestine, Israel is a rational citizen. And in the end of the day, the average citizen in Palestine, Israel wants a life of dignity, security, and respect. And if that’s how we frame the advantages of peace, if that’s how leaders talk about peace, rather than it being a liability and it being basically something that is so horrible because we tried it 30 years ago — we’re never going to try it again — then guess what? People are not going to support it. And so it comes down to what messages and what our leaders are promoting on both sides. Now, to be fair, again, to back the Palestine authority, they have always called for a two-state solution. Hamas has not. But Hamas has enjoyed a lot of room to grow and to consolidate its authority in Gaza. The Netanyahu government has a coalition that is calling for the ethnic cleansing of the West Bank and Gaza of Arabs and Palestinians. I mean, how is that framing a conversation about the benefits of mutual recognition and coexistence?

ezra klein

Well, I think we can agree that the leaders in power right now are definitely not framing that conversation. I do want to bring this back, actually, to Hamas because you’ve done survey work there over long periods of time. And so you’ve seen how support for Hamas changes during periods of conflict with Israel, during periods of more armed resistance, during periods of war. What have you seen there? What happens to support for Hamas during periods of increased conflict with Israel?

amaney jamal

So what we see typically, Ezra, is that when you have these cycles of violence and when you have basically what’s seen as the indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians, especially in Gaza, this bodes well for support for Hamas, that, OK, you know what? We’re going to support this terrorist movement because the world is not listening. Even when we were not supporting Hamas, we were told we were supporting Hamas, and we were punished for not even supporting Hamas. So it does bode well in terms of support for Hamas. I mean, think about what that psychologically might do to a population. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

There is a tendency from outside to be primarily interested, I think, in what Gazans think of the peace process, or the lack of a peace process, of Hamas’s governing authority. But obviously, they, like almost all people, are concerned with their day-to-day life. And one of the things that really struck me in your polling had to do with simply the questions about material reality, and particularly, the questions about food and how that’s changed over time. Can you walk me through that?

amaney jamal

So what we found, Ezra, is about 3/4, so about 75 percent, of Palestinians in Gaza, saying that they had run out of food and lacked the money to buy more at some point during the previous 30 days. So that’s three in every four individuals saying that they didn’t have enough food to eat. And that number is up significantly from our 2021 survey, where only 51 percent, so about half of Gaza said they couldn’t afford to eat. I mean, Gaza has been under blockade. And so this blockade has always posed significant economic challenges. I know there are those out there who think that Gaza could have been Dubai. The truth is, under the conditions of the blockade, that’s just not feasible. Before all of this, they were relying on about 500 trucks a day of assistance and aid from the global community and from the international organizations. And we see today some of the global speakers applauding the entry of 20 or 30 trucks since the last three weeks of this devastation happening in Gaza. So there are dire, dire humanitarian conditions. And we see this in the poll even before Oct. 7, Ezra. So you can only imagine today how much worse it is. And so, then, the question does become, how well is Hamas doing in terms of governing and providing for the people of Gaza? Clearly, from our survey, we’re not finding evidence that the average Palestinian was very content with the economic situation in Gaza before Oct. the 7th.

ezra klein

This was one of the most surprising findings to me in your survey, that when you asked Gazans who they blamed for food insecurity, from the outside, you might think, well, they’ll blame Israel because of the blockade. But that isn’t what most of them said. How did they think about it?

amaney jamal

So they did mention the Israeli blockade, but the response that was cited most frequently by Palestinians was basically the Hamas government, the mismanagement of the Hamas-led government. And again, this speaks to the issue that we were talking about, which was levels of corruption. So the average Palestinian might be thinking like, yes, there’s this blockade. Yes, this blockade is horrendous. But on top of it, you have mismanagement of the food and the resources of the state that is resulting in an unequal dispersion of resources or foods or aid to people. So they are placing the blame on the Hamas-led government.

ezra klein

And one way of reading that might be that this will weaken the Hamas government, but I was looking back at other things you’d written, and you wrote this piece for Monkey Cage, which was a political science site at The Washington Post back in 2014, co-wrote this piece, where you found that Hamas supporters tended to be in a better position economically. And you suggested that, quote, “Instead of pressuring Hamas, a key effect of the blockade has been to make life more difficult for opponents of the movement. And those who wish to benefit economically are incentivized to remain tied to Hamas.” Tell me a bit about that dynamic.

amaney jamal

So and we have evidence of that a little bit, Ezra, in this poll, which is that the poor folks, the really disadvantaged people in Gaza, were most critical of Hamas. So it does lead us to believe that there is this middle class group of individuals that benefits from close ties with Hamas, and they are invested in seeing that government stay in power. But we see that across the Arab world as well. Ironically, the middle class, which is often sort of seen as the champion of democratization or democratic movements, what we find is that this aspiring class of citizens who believe that, OK, there’s some aura of economic stability. Therefore, I am not going to rock the boat. So, on the surface, they’re not staunch supporters of authoritarianism or for Hamas or for terrorism. They just find it very beneficial to support a status quo government that is OK for their economic livelihood. These are the people who sort of will turn a blind eye to the excesses of these regimes, as long as their economic conditions are met. It’s really the poor, disadvantaged citizens across these societies that end up having to bear the brunt of public mismanagement and of a government that is not representing their interests.

ezra klein

How much does that turn them towards more radical alternatives? I mean, something I noticed in a couple of different polls was very high levels of support for the forming of armed groups like Lion’s Den and the Jenin Battalion, that there was a poll from the Washington Institute that found high levels of support for Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which is arguably more extreme than Hamas. How much does a frustration with the P.A. and with Hamas turn people towards more radical movements?

These are questions that we analyze all the time. Like, who is more susceptible to radicalization in general? And what we often find is that your average person who has limited upward social mobility tends to be more susceptible to the cause of radicalization. But also what we’re learning and what we’re seeing in our polls is that people want alternatives to the status quo. If you had an alternative in Gaza today that would say, oh, we’re going to fight for the two-state solution, but yet, that movement is living under blockade, that movement does not have any partners to speak to, that movement has no world support, the average citizen is not going to find that message very appealing. And so, unfortunately, groups like the Islamic Jihad, who are more extreme than Hamas, can basically say — and this is what they’ll say in their mobilization — look, the P.A. failed because it wanted peace. Hamas was in a cease-fire with Israel in its compromise, quote unquote. And then Islamic Jihad, well, yeah, we’re like the true terrorists. Join us, because there are no alternatives. I want to make sure that your listeners understand and appreciate this. It is incumbent upon a global society to give people different alternatives to believe in and that track well among their people. The fact that nobody can talk about a two-state solution in Gaza, even though we saw that there’s support for it, it was before the attacks and before the Israeli attacks on citizens. So this is not out of a moment of desperation. There is some genuine support there. At least, there is some support that you can tap into. But that message of two-state solution or a peaceful resolution does not track well because leaders and the political process has failed. It’s no longer seen as a very legitimate option, Ezra.

One thing that alarmed me when I was preparing for this is that I think in America, we’re used to an age breakdown, where younger people are more liberal, a bit more dovish, a bit more idealistic. And in Israel and in Palestine, you see something different. These are much younger societies than we are. The average age of Israelis is around 30. The average age of a Palestinian is around 20. And young Palestinians appear more open to the formation of armed groups. The anti-judicial reform movement has been older in Israel. The Israeli left skews older at this point. And in surveys I’ve seen of Gaza and the West Bank, younger respondents seem to be more militaristic, more fatalistic about the possibilities for a two-state solution than older Palestinians are. So first, is that a correct rendering of the polling in your understanding of it? And second, what do you make of it?

amaney jamal

So I do believe it’s correct. You do see these more extreme attitudes among youth populations on both the Israeli and Palestinian side. The truth is, Ezra, at least, if I’m correct, and there wasn’t extensive polling back on the eve of Oslo, that wasn’t the case then. Then you had groups like Seeds of Peace. You had ideas about reconciliation. It was very common for the youth to talk about the advantages and the possibilities and the dreams and the hopes linked to a two-state solution. So, again, what we see today in these polls is really a byproduct of a failed political process and failed leadership on both sides that have pushed their publics to the extreme, right? So this has a very sad effect on the youth on both sides. But also, I want to bring in the role of social media. I look at some of the things I’m seeing on TikTok and elsewhere. And the truth is, it just pains me. It pains me as a mother. It pains me as a citizen of the world. It pains me as somebody who still fundamentally believes in a two-state solution that our children can be so ruthless to each other, on both the Israeli and the Palestinian side. It just pains me. It pains me, it pains me, it pains me. When our children are ridiculing the death and suffering of the other side, somebody has done something wrong. And I just hope that we look at this, and we say that this is what the failure of reconciliation and peace has brought. There is an active dehumanization campaign going on, on both ends, and it’s just got to stop. When you look at Palestinian public opinion, and I can speak authoritatively on the Palestinian public opinion side of it, it also matters what world leaders say. So when world leaders come around and basically dehumanize Palestinians or legitimate the killing of women and children, or basically, do not say anything about the humanity behind these women and children being killed, that hardens their opinions about the peace process, about the state of Israel, about the global community. This is also a population that is desperate for international recognition of their humanity. And you saw this. You saw that Queen Rania basically took to the airwaves with Christiane Amanpour on CNN. And basically, her whole message was, I want the West to remember that we are people, are human beings. They are just human beings. When any leader just simply says, you have to remember that Palestinians are also human, we see changes in public opinion that are far more favorable. So, again, Palestinians are frustrated with the lack of humanization of their own children, their own lives, their own plights in this conflict.

ezra klein

Does that go the other way, too? One thing I’ve heard from a lot of Israelis, particularly over the last couple of weeks, although you hear it more often, too, although I’ve heard it before also, is that, yes, Israelis are seen as human in much of the West, but they fear that any group that would elect Hamas does not see them as human, that their lives are beyond expendable. And of course, the attacks on Oct. 7 seemed like final confirmation of that. I mean, they were butchered. There’s often an anger or a fear that they are not seen as human enough by Palestinians, by others in the Arab world, to live next to, to live alongside. And as such, then they cannot feel safe enough to do so. Is there anything owed to them, too?

amaney jamal

100 percent. 100 percent. I mean, of course, Israelis also are shaken by the core. I mean what happened to them on Oct. 7 is atrocious. And like you said, they were butchered, they were massacred. It is horrendous. But again, I want to just ask you, Ezra, I mean, the fact that immediately it was well-known that Israel was going to retaliate for this in Gaza, Palestinians were told to evacuate and go south and north and east, and we don’t know, right? Is it really for Israelis to sit there and wait for the Gazans to talk about this Israeli suffering while they are now going to be suffering as well? I mean, is that the litmus test? So I do believe that Israeli security and the humanity and the dignity of Israeli citizens and the sanctity of Israeli and Jewish life in Israel should not be based on what’s happening in moments of war and devastation. This is not the finest moment of the Palestinian-Israeli coexistence. Why? Because for 20 years, extremists have led this conflict. There’s a lot of hatred, a lot of pain. And right now, we’re in the middle of the war. But in general, there is a lot of outrage in terms of what happened in Israel. And so that is the common ground that peacemakers need to bring leaders together to simultaneously condemn and stand with the citizens of Israel, but also stand with the citizens of Gaza, who had nothing to do with this. I mean, if Hamas is this organization that is propped up by Iran or is a proxy of Iran, why are you holding accountable innocent children in Gaza for that? For that, you — I’m not saying, why is the world? And so, in the end of the day, the political process has not brought our humanity together so that Palestinian can say to Israelis, we are devastated about what happened. We are shocked. We are horrified for you. We will stand with you. But what platform will allow for that exchange or for Israelis to step up? We’re seeing this. We’re seeing Israelis protesting in Tel Aviv, saying that they don’t stand by what’s happening in Gaza.

ezra klein

I think that’s a powerful point to end on. So then always our final question, what are three books you would recommend to the audience?

amaney jamal

So I recommend a new book by Shibley Telhami, Michael Barnett, Marc Lynch and Nathan Brown on “The One State Reality.” I also recommend a book by my colleague — I mentioned Khalil Shikaki and Shai Feldman — that captures what I was trying to get at, Ezra, in terms of the public opinion where we see public opinion being softened towards each other and a two-state solution. It’s called “Arabs and Israelis: Conflict and Peacemaking in the Middle East.” And for a good primer and a good history of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, I recommend my colleague, Mark Tessler’s book, “A History of the Israeli-Palestination Conflict.”

471,471,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/opinion/antisemitism-jews-campus.html,"The targeting of Jewish students didn’t stop at Cornell: Jewish students at Cooper Union huddled in the library to escape an angry crowd pounding on the doors; a protester at a rally near New York University carried a sign calling for the world to be kept “clean” of Jews; messages like “glory to our martyrs” were projected onto a George Washington University building.

This most recent wave of hate began with prejudiced comments obscured by seemingly righteous language. After the Oct. 7 attacks, more than 30 student groups at Harvard signed on to a statement that read, “We, the undersigned student organizations, hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.” There was no mention of Hamas. The university issued such a tepid response, it almost felt like an invitation.

Days later, at a pro-Palestinian rally, the Cornell associate professor Russell Rickford said he was “exhilarated” by Hamas’s terrorist attacks. (He later apologized and was granted a leave of absence.) In an article, a Columbia professor, Joseph Massad, seemed to relish the “awesome” scenes of “Palestinian resistance fighters” storming into Israel. Most recently, over 100 Columbia and Barnard professors signed a letter defending students who blamed Israel for Hamas’s attacks. To the best of our knowledge, none of these professors have received meaningful discipline, much less dismissal. Another green light.

Over these last few weeks, dozens of anti-Israel protests have been hosted on or near college campuses. Many of these demonstrations had threatening features: Masked students have chanted slogans such as “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” which many view as a call for the destruction of Israel. Others have shouted, “There is only one solution, intifada revolution.” The word “intifada” has a gruesome history: During the Aqsa intifada of the early 2000s, hundreds of Israeli civilians were killed in attacks.

On at least one occasion, these student protests have even interrupted candlelight vigils for the victims of Oct. 7. And they haven’t been condemned by the leadership at enough universities. In recent days, some universities, including Cornell, have released statements denouncing antisemitism on campus. Harvard also announced the creation of an advisory group to combat antisemitism."
472,472,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/travel/middle-east-travel-israel-war.html,"Dear Tripped Up,

After two pandemic-related delays, we were finally set to take a $34,309 Nile cruise with Viking, leaving Oct. 25 and including several days in Cairo and additional excursions to Jerusalem and Petra, in Jordan. But the war broke out, and the Middle East is very unstable. Viking canceled our excursion to Jerusalem, refunded that money and rebooked our flights for Oct. 29. But we don’t think Egypt or Jordan is particularly safe right now either, especially for Jews. We are older, and are heartsick at not seeing Jerusalem and terrified at the thought of being targeted as American Jewish tourists during this war. Viking still has $29,435 of our money. We only want a voucher to take the same trip in the future. Can you help? Joseph and Antonia, Oakland, Calif.

Dear Joseph and Antonia,

Every traveler calculates risk in their own way, often through a mix of personal experience, news reports and emotion. That’s why it is unsurprising you are far from alone with your worries about traveling now — in recent weeks, plenty of consumers on online discussion boards have echoed your concerns.

This is also a high stakes issue for the travel industry, and it is hardly isolated to travel to countries surrounding Israel. Wildfires, earthquakes and, of course, the pandemic have disrupted travel in the last few years, and often people fear traveling in proximity to natural disasters and human-created emergencies. But does the fact that you are afraid for your safety require a tour operator to refund you your money?

I emailed Viking on your behalf on the morning of Oct. 24. Three hours later, you received a $29,435 credit toward a future cruise, good as long as you book within 12 months.

Was this a coincidence? I honestly don’t know, since Viking responded to neither my initial email nor multiple other requests for comment.

But the credit did represent an about-face from the company, whose replies to your earlier repeated inquires via email had included mostly boilerplate language. “We completely understand your concern and we are sorry to hear of your disappointment,” Viking wrote in one response. “You should know, the safety of our guests and crew is our highest priority.” They also told you they “work closely with our global network to understand the situation firsthand” and “are prepared to make any future adjustments as needed.”

To paraphrase: “You’re out of luck.”

You did make more progress by phone after receiving these rejections. On Saturday, Oct. 21, as you told me, a “lead customer support specialist” said she would check with management and get back to you by the following Monday. She did not, but eventually responded by saying she would try again. The next day, I wrote in.

Whether it was her or me or both, the fact that Viking parried your initial requests should not be surprising. There is only mixed evidence that travel to Egypt or Jordan could be any more dangerous than when you made the booking.

Yes, the State Department last month issued a “Worldwide Caution” notice that travelers should be alert to “the potential for terrorist attacks, demonstrations or violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests,” but that’s not specific to the Middle East, North Africa or any destination. More relevantly, the U.S. embassy in Cairo issued a “Demonstration Alert,” warning that protests, “potentially including anti-U.S. sentiment, may occur in Cairo or elsewhere in Egypt.”

But despite the possibility of demonstrations, the fact that Egypt borders Israel does not necessarily equate to danger throughout the country. Sudan, Egypt’s southern neighbor, has been at war for six months, which has not seriously disrupted Egyptian tourism. And the State Department, which assigns danger levels from Level 1 (“Exercise Normal Precautions”) to Level 4 (“Do Not Travel”), had labeled Egypt a Level 3 (“Reconsider Travel”) in 2020, long before the Israel-Hamas war. Jordan, your other destination, remains at Level 2, on a par with France and Peru.

So though it may be obvious to you that travel to Egypt is too dangerous right now, it is not obvious to the State Department, or to companies like Intrepid Travel. Matt Berna, Intrepid’s president for the Americas, told me the company has neither canceled nor modified its Egypt (and Jordan) trips because of feedback from ground staff. “We have operations teams working with hotels, he said, “and group leaders out in the tourist sites and in the streets with the groups. They’re feeling what’s happening every day” and reporting in to the country offices. A State Department Level 4 warning, though, would trump that, he said.

Travelers like you are left in a difficult position when their risk assessment differs from the company they booked with. Even for those with travel insurance, geopolitical events are generally excluded from coverage — only a “cancel for any reason” policy would cover such a disruption.

“The consumer is kind of faced with this awkward option of going on a trip and being really fearful or not going on a trip and losing money,” said Jeffrey Ment, a travel industry lawyer who has fielded “probably 100” related inquiries from clients since the war began.

But the companies he represents are also in a bind, he stressed, because — though we travelers rarely think about it — they have already spent some or even most of what you’ve paid them. “Follow the money,” he said. “Maybe it’s gone from a travel company to a cruise line, or from a cruise line to a fuel supplier, a food supplier, a staff supplier or an entertainment supplier. And those other companies are not giving the money back, because travel to Egypt is open and on.”

“You can’t force Viking or anybody else to just gratuitously refund the money that they don’t have,” he added.

Well, you can’t force them, but you can sometimes entreat them.

Mr. Berna told me that Intrepid’s internal policy does make room for this. “While we don’t publicly announce free changes and free cancellations,” he said, “if someone calls in and feels like they’re just not going to have an enjoyable trip, a safe trip, then we’re allowing them to change to a different date in the same region” or even a future credit.

Or, as Mr. Ment told me when I asked him to assess Viking’s decision to grant you credit: “It’s common practice. The squeaky wheel wins.”

Luckily there are many squeak aids available to travelers, even beyond writing to trippedup@nytimes.com. (I welcome all travel-related complaints, though my capacity to squeak about Middle East refunds will likely not go beyond this column.) There’s posting online reviews, and registering more formal complaints through the Better Business Bureau and Elliott Advocacy, both nonprofits. The offices of your state’s attorney general are used to taking on travel companies (though state laws vary), and you can ask your credit card to squeak for you through a chargeback request, as long as you are ready to go back and forth with them for months.

Still, everyone should start with a personal squeak: Call or write to the companies yourself, attempting (with patience and politeness) to get bumped up the customer service ranks until you reach someone who has the power to make an exception.

If you need advice about a best-laid travel plan that went awry, send an email to TrippedUp@nytimes.com.

473,473,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/business/tiktok-antisemitism-claims-israel-palestinians.html,"TikTok pushed back on Thursday against growing claims in recent weeks that it had failed to protect Jewish users and had pushed pro-Palestinian content in the United States.

In a statement on its website the company said, “Hateful ideologies, like antisemitism, are not and have never been allowed on our platform.” The company said that since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, it had removed millions of TikTok videos related to hate speech, hateful behavior, harassment and bullying.

Many social networks have come under criticism for spreading misinformation and hate speech during the Israel-Hamas war. TikTok has the added scrutiny of being owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. While Beijing has pitched itself as a neutral broker in the dispute, a surge of antisemitism and anti-Israeli sentiment is proliferating across the Chinese internet and state media.

Last week, Jeff Morris Jr., a former vice president at the dating app Tinder, claimed that pro-Palestinian hashtags on TikTok garnered three billion views while pro-Israel hashtags gathered a couple hundred million views. His post, published on X, formerly known as Twitter, was part of a longer thread that was seen millions of times and argued that TikTok was the reason Israel was “losing the information war with high school & college students.”

Republican lawmakers like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida have jumped on such concerns. In a post on X on Wednesday, Mr. Rubio said, “TikTok is a tool China uses to spread propaganda to Americans, now it’s being used to downplay Hamas terrorism.”

But Mr. Morris’s post appeared to reference views from the hashtags over several years. The company seemed to refer to Mr. Morris’s posts on Thursday, criticizing an “unsound analysis of TikTok hashtag data around the conflict.” TikTok said the hashtag #standwithisrael had gained 46.3 million views since Oct. 7 in the United States compared with 29.4 million for #standwithpalestine. Mr. Morris didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

A group of Jewish TikTok creators and celebrities who post to the platform, including the comedian Amy Schumer and the actors Michael Rapaport and Debra Messing, wrote an open letter to TikTok on Wednesday, saying it was “falling woefully short by not protecting the safety of its Jewish creators and community and by not monitoring and guiding public discourse to ensure the platform doesn’t become a permanent cesspool of indiscriminate and aggressive antisemitism.”

The group said that it was difficult to filter antisemitic comments on TikTok as hostile users replaced letters like “S” with “$.” They added that upon reporting death threats, TikTok moderators said that the comment “I hope you die” was permissible. The letter also said that first-person accounts about atrocities experienced by Israeli civilians had been flagged, presumably by anti-Israeli users, and removed, and accused TikTok’s algorithm of directing attention away from Jewish creators’ posts about Israel.

TikTok said that it was investing in moderation, including trainings for teams to stay ahead of new forms of hate speech and behavior, and that it was consulting with groups like the Anti-Defamation League.

Yaël Eisenstat, a vice president at the Anti-Defamation League, said that her group has given training to TikTok on antisemitic content and that its website maintains a “glossary of extremism and hate” that it regularly updates.

Ms. Eisenstat said she appreciated TikTok’s outreach to her group but added “that does not abdicate them from the responsibility to actually provide more tools to civil society groups to study what’s actually happening.” She said the recent outcry over the posts on the site showed that TikTok should offer data on how it serves videos to civil liberty groups. The company said it started offering such data to academic researchers and will include other groups in the future."
474,474,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-hostages-us.html,"The U.S. military is flying surveillance drones over the Gaza Strip, according to two Defense Department officials and an analysis by The New York Times. The officials said the drones were being used to aid in hostage recovery efforts, indicating that the U.S. is more involved than previously known.

The aircraft are MQ-9 Reapers operated by U.S. Special Operations forces and were first spotted on Saturday on Flightradar24, a publicly accessible flight-tracking website, though Pentagon officials said that the aircraft have been active in the area since the days after the Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel by Hamas.

While Israel frequently conducts reconnaissance flights over Gaza, U.S. defense officials said it was believed to be the first time that U.S. drones have flown missions over Gaza.

The flights are operating at a critical juncture. Israel is in the early stages of a ground invasion in Gaza and says Hamas is holding more than 240 hostages, 10 of whom are believed to be Americans.

The unarmed surveillance flights are not supporting Israeli military operations on the ground, according to the Defense Department officials. Two officials said the goal was to assist in locating hostages, monitor for signs of life and pass potential leads to the Israel Defense Forces.

The U.S. military has been providing military aid, including bombs and artillery rounds, to Israel, and has deployed two aircraft carriers and hundreds of troops to the Middle East since the Oct. 7 attack. Several dozen American commandos have been dispatched to Israel to help advise on hostage recovery efforts. But the surveillance flights suggest that the Pentagon is taking a more active role in a key I.D.F. mission to rescue hostages.

The flights are concentrated in southern Gaza, approximately 15 miles from the Israeli military’s initial push in the north. There appear to be at least six separate MQ-9 aircraft involved in the effort, according to Amelia Smith, an aviation researcher who has been tracking the flights. Several aircraft analyzed by The Times and Ms. Smith loitered over Gaza for about three hours, at 24,000 to 26,000 feet.

The MQ-9 was designed as the U.S. Air Force’s first “hunter-killer” drone, but it is primarily used for surveillance missions because of its sophisticated sensors and ability to loiter above an area for more than 20 hours at a time. It has been used to conduct airstrikes and collect intelligence in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. The MQ-9 is used by many militaries around the world, but not by Israel."

This week, the director of the F.B.I. warned Congress that the Israel-Hamas war had escalated threats against Jews and Muslims in the United States, and that antisemitic threats had reached “historic levels.”

The concern, in the aftermath of Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, goes beyond the United States. Roger Cohen, the Times Paris bureau chief, wrote this week that the assault “has awakened a repressed horror in Jewish populations” in Europe, perhaps not felt “since the Holocaust.” Today, Mr. Cohen joins Lulu Garcia-Navarro to discuss the surge in acts of antisemitism, and the fear rising among Europe’s Jews.

477,477,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/world/middleeast/cornell-antisemitism-class-canceled.html,"Cornell University has canceled classes for Friday following the arrest of a student charged with making violent antisemitic threats, aiming to give students and faculty time to rest and reflect and to calm campus tensions over the Israel-Hamas war.

“The hope for tomorrow is that everyone will use this as restorative time to take care of themselves,” Lindsey Knewstub, a university spokeswoman, said in an email.

The student charged with making antisemitic threats, Patrick Dai, a 21-year-old computer science major, appeared in federal court Wednesday on charges of posting threats online to kill or injure others. If convicted, he faces a maximum prison term of five years and a fine of up to $250,000.

In a series of posts on a forum dedicated to discussing fraternity and sorority life, Mr. Dai allegedly threatened to slit the throats of Jewish people and referred to them as rats and pigs, according to a federal complaint. Using the screen name “Hamas,” he was also accused of posting that he would “bring an assault rifle to campus and shoot.”

One post specifically threatened a kosher and multicultural dining room on campus, which is next to a Center for Jewish Living.

“We hear that as a call for our genocide,” said Rabbi Ari Weiss, the executive director of Cornell Hillel, a Jewish group on campus. “Students are scared. They’re concerned for their safety.”

According to the federal complaint, Mr. Dai, who is from Pittsford, N.Y., admitted to posting the threatening messages in an F.B.I. interview after his arrest. He is being held in the Broome County jail and is being represented by a public defender.

Tensions have been high on Cornell’s campus since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, which killed at least 1,400 people and which resulted in more than 200 hostages being taken back to Gaza. Counterattacks by Israel in Gaza in the following weeks have killed thousands of civilians.

The atmosphere at Cornell grew especially fraught when Russell Rickford, an associate professor in the university’s history department who specializes in African American political culture, gave a speech in downtown Ithaca on Oct. 15 in which he said he found the attack on Israel by Hamas to be “exhilarating.” He later apologized and requested a leave of absence from the university.

After the threatening posts appeared online Sunday, university officials and Gov. Kathy Hochul condemned them as hate speech. The university and the governor tried to reassure students they were taking steps to keep students safe.

“We will not tolerate threats or hatred or antisemitism,” Ms. Hochul said in a visit to campus on Monday.

Campus athletics and other events may go forward on Friday, but classes will be canceled to give staff and students time to “reflect on how we can nurture the kind of caring, mutually supportive community that we all value,” the college said in a campuswide email.

Several students interviewed around the campus on Thursday said that things felt tense.

“I’m seeing a lot more of my friends, students at Cornell, more upset than usual,” said Jack Merrill, 22, a Jewish computer science major in the School of Engineering, who said he had never met Mr. Dai. He said he appreciated the university’s decision to cancel classes. “I’ve never seen antisemitism to this scale on campus,” he said.

Still, he added, “I refuse to live in fear.”

They lived with frequent wars between city-states, with massacres and mass rape. In response, they adopted a tragic sensibility. This sensibility begins with the awareness that the crust of civilization is thin. Breakdowns into barbarism are the historical norm. Don’t fool yourself into believing that you’re living in some modern age, too enlightened for hatred to take over.

In these circumstances, everybody has a choice. You can try to avoid thinking about the dark realities of life and naïvely wish that bad things won’t happen. Or you can confront these realities and develop a tragic mentality to help you thrive among them. As Ralph Waldo Emerson would write centuries later, “Great men, great nations have not been boasters and buffoons, but perceivers of the terror of life, and have manned themselves to face it.” And that goes for great women, too.

This tragic sensibility prepares you for the rigors of life in concrete ways. First, it teaches a sense of humility. The tragedies that populated Greek stages sent the message that our accomplishments were tenuous. They remind us that it’s easy to become proud and conceited in moments of peace. We begin to exaggerate our ability to control our own destinies. We begin to assume that the so-called justice of our cause guarantees our success. Humility is not thinking lowly of yourself; it’s an accurate perception of yourself. It is the ability to cast aside illusions and vanities and see life as it really is.

Second, the tragic sensibility nurtures a prudent approach to life. It encourages people to focus on the downsides of their actions and work to head them off. As Hal Brands and Charles Edel write in “The Lessons of Tragedy,” Greek tragedies were part of a wide culture that forced the Greeks to confront their own “frailty and fallibility.” By “shocking, unsettling and disturbing the audience, the tragedies also forced discussions of what was needed to circumvent such a fate.” In this way, people are taught resilience and anti-fragility — to be prepared for the pain that will inevitably come.

Third, this tragic mentality encourages caution. As Thucydides would argue, in politics, the lows are lower than the highs are high. The price we pay for our errors is higher than the benefits we gain from our successes. So be careful of rushing headlong into maximalist action, convinced of your own righteousness. Be incremental and patient and steady. This is advice I wish the Israelis would heed as they wage war on Hamas. This is advice that Matt Gaetz and the burn-it-all-down caucus among the House Republicans will never understand."

Grief, rage and fear are radiating outward from the Middle East and tearing at the fabric of our own liberal democracy, especially on college campuses. The stories are already legion. Activists have ripped down posters of kidnapped Israeli women and children. The chancellor of the State University System of Florida ordered the deactivation of two campus chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine. At Cooper Union in New York City, Jewish students sheltered inside the library while pro-Palestinian protesters pounded on the doors. And in Ithaca, N.Y., a Cornell University student was arrested after publishing vile threats against the school’s Jewish community.

That’s the tip of an iceberg of campus controversy, and I can’t help noticing that the intensity of the conflict is magnified by both legal ignorance and reckless disregard for longstanding legal precedents. Just as there are international rules that apply to shooting wars, there are constitutional rules that apply to our nation’s culture wars, and applying those rules properly is one way that a continent-size, multifaith, multicultural society peacefully perseveres through profound division.

To understand the constitutional rules of culture war, you have to understand that the goals of American law are to render Americans both free and safe but not necessarily comfortable. As the Supreme Court put it in Island Trees School District v. Pico, a 1982 case dealing with a book-banning controversy in the midst of the Cold War, one of the reasons even young students enjoy freedom of speech is to prepare them for “active and effective participation in the pluralistic, often contentious society in which they will soon be adult members.”

So important is the marketplace of ideas on campus that the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that “teachers and students must always remain free to inquire, to study and to evaluate, to gain new maturity and understanding; otherwise our civilization will stagnate and die.”

Note that the court said our “civilization,” not our “nation.” A nation called the United States of America can still exist even if it slides into authoritarianism, but our civilization is intended to be a rights-based liberal democracy, where people who possess diametrically opposed points of view cannot just survive but also thrive without compromising their most fundamental beliefs — so long as they don’t interfere with the rights of others.

This vision of both freedom and safety was powerfully articulated by President George Washington in his famous letter to the Hebrew congregation in Newport, R.I., in August 1790. He wrote to members of one of the world’s most persecuted religions and said, “all possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship.” That’s a beautiful vision of American freedom. Yet there was also a vision of American safety. “May the Children of the Stock of Abraham,” Washington wrote, “who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants; while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.”

Of course, that’s a promise America has too often failed to keep, and not just for America’s Jewish community. But it’s a promise nonetheless, and it’s a promise that extends to Americans of every race and religion.

I started with the soaring rhetoric of democracy and pluralism for a reason. They represent the moral and philosophical foundations for the concrete constitutional rules of culture war that directly apply on campus. And if students, faculties and administrators knew these rules and followed these rules — rigorously and fairly — then our conflicts would be far more manageable and sustainable. If campuses refuse to follow these rules, then it places not just the colleges but also the culture under immense strain, and it wreaks havoc on the lives of the students themselves.

The goal of this newsletter is to write not a legal treatise but rather a legal primer. I want to share a few simple principles that are easy to explain but difficult to uphold in the face of extreme grief and rage.

The right to speak includes a right to offensive speech. This is a lesson that colleges have had to learn time and time again. The fact that any person finds my speech infuriating, insulting or even hateful does not grant the government the right to silence my voice. This is among the most basic principles of American free speech jurisprudence. As the Supreme Court held in a 1989 case called Texas v. Johnson, “If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.”

This is not a new concept. In 1949, when America was gripped by deep divisions and extreme fear over the emerging Cold War, the court held in Terminiello v. Chicago that “a function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are or even stirs people to anger.”

Critically — and this might be counterintuitive — this right to engage in provocative speech can even include endorsing violence. For example, in a 1969 case, Watts v. United States, the Supreme Court reversed the conviction of a young man who publicly stated at an antiwar rally, “If they ever make me carry a rifle, the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.”

There are legal limits to endorsing violence, of course, but they’re narrowly and carefully drawn. In Brandenburg v. Ohio, another 1969 case that is one of the most famous in Supreme Court history, the court struck down an Ohio criminal syndicalism statute (such statutes proliferated in the early 20th century and were often aimed at Communists, union organizers, antiwar activists and others who were deemed dangerously radical) after the state used it to prosecute a man who appeared at a Klan rally that included armed, hooded men and a burning cross.

The state could prosecute his words, the court held, only if they were “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action” and were “likely to incite or produce such action.” Quoting a prior case, the court distinguished between the “abstract teaching” of “the moral propriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence” from “preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action.”

Under this construct, public support for Hamas — or public support for carpet bombing Gaza — is constitutionally protected, even if it’s gross and immoral, and public institutions that suppress such speech violate the First Amendment.

Florida’s decision to deactivate local chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine, for example, cannot be based on rhetorical support for a horrific terrorist attack. Florida claims that the student group’s words constitute “material support” for terrorism. But vocalizing support for heinous acts is not a crime. In fact, the group’s “tool kit” is a messaging document, and the actions it urges include handing out fliers, tabling (setting up tables on campus to hand out literature) and writing and signing statements. Deactivating a group on the basis of its expression — in the absence of evidence of genuine criminal activity — is a clear violation of the First Amendment.

The right to speak does not include a right to silence others. Putting up a poster is an act of protected speech. Tearing down that poster is not, even if the person destroying the poster is trying to make his or her own statement. Tearing down a poster is akin to shouting down a public speaker. Your protest cannot trump the speaker’s own right to free speech. The answer to a poster is another poster, not destroying the expression you hate, by tearing it down or defacing it any way.

In fact, many federal courts, including trial and appellate courts, have held that government entities have a responsibility to protect freedom of expression, even from hostile crowds. If the government systematically looks the other way as private citizens suppress the free speech of others, then the government can be liable for its failure to protect free expression.

One of the most powerful and compelling arguments for free speech in American history was born out of mob suppression. In 1860, Frederick Douglass wrote his “Plea for Free Speech in Boston” after a violent mob shut down an antislavery event. “To suppress free speech is a double wrong,” Douglass wrote. “It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker. It is just as criminal to rob a man of his right to speak and hear as it would be to rob him of his money.”

Exactly so. Public universities can and should take action against members of the community who tear down posters or shout down speakers, and if they fail to protect free expression, then they may be held liable. Mob censorship isn’t free speech.

The right to speak does not include a right to harass. This last concept is perhaps the most difficult to understand and apply consistently. The right to speak, as I said, absolutely includes a right to offend. The government cannot silence your speech simply because it makes people angry or upset.

At the same time, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of “race, color or national origin” in programs that receive federal funds. The Biden administration has made it abundantly clear that this prohibition of harassment includes protections against antisemitism, including antisemitic harassment.

What is unlawful harassment, and how is it different from protected speech? The best definition in the educational context comes from a 1999 case, Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education. The court held that a student can sue a school under federal civil rights laws prohibiting sex discrimination if it fails to prevent peer harassment or student-on-student harassment, but the student has to “show harassment that is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive and that so undermines and detracts from the victims’ educational experience that the victims are effectively denied equal access to an institution’s resources and opportunities.”

This is a strict standard but certainly one that applies to threats and to acts of physical intimidation. If anti-harassment laws mean anything, they mean that students shouldn’t have to fear for their safety from fellow students simply because of their race, color or national origin. When student protesters bang on doors and intimidate students trapped inside a library, it raises concerns under Title VI. If a Jewish student is surrounded on the sidewalk, pushed and blocked from leaving by angry peers, it raises concerns under Title VI.

Critically, federal law does not permit schools to simply leave the dispute to the students. Yes, students can be held legally responsible for their own actions (like the Cornell student arrested after making violent threats), and students can sue other students, but schools are also legally responsible if they exhibit “deliberate indifference” to the plight of the harassed. Every college and university — public or private — that receives federal funds has an affirmative duty to protect students’ civil rights.

In the recent past, schools have sometimes been too enthusiastic about stopping harassment, defining the term so broadly that university anti-harassment policies actually violate students’ free speech rights. During my career litigating free speech cases, I won several lawsuits against schools that were so keen on stopping harassment that they suppressed even constitutionally protected speech, often on the grounds that “offensive” speech by itself violated student rights.

Properly applied, however, anti-harassment laws can protect the marketplace of ideas. Students cannot truly feel free if they are not safe, and anti-harassment laws are indispensable to protecting the safety of any campus community.

The three legal doctrines outlined above provide a simple framework for debate and dialogue. Taken together, they’re saying, “I can speak, you can speak, and we’re both safe.” They are not, however, a framework for comfort. Citizens in a pluralistic society should expect to feel angry. We should expect to be upset. Diverting that anger into words and not violence is how our society survives.

Free speech is a marvelous American value, but it is not utopian. Nothing about liberal democracy is utopian. The American experiment is in many ways based on the understanding that human beings both are fundamentally flawed and possess incalculable worth. Our flaws mean that utopia is impossible. Our worth requires any just government to protect our unalienable rights.

I’ve long appreciated the pseudonymous writer Scott Alexander’s description of liberalism: “People talk about ‘liberalism’ as if it’s just another word for capitalism or libertarianism or vague center-left-Democratic Clintonism,” he wrote on his Slate Star Codex blog. “Liberalism is none of these things. Liberalism is a technology for preventing civil war.”

He’s exactly correct. And as the Supreme Court has repeatedly observed, our nation’s educational system — and especially its college campuses — is the place where we learn liberalism. It’s the place where we are supposed to practice pluralism. Our system of government was built to accommodate conflict but only as long as that conflict is channeled through a Constitution that protects our liberty from the government and empowers that government to protect its citizens from one another.

Students are entitled to be free. They are entitled to be safe. But enduring hard words and hearing dreadful ideas isn’t just an inescapable element of pluralism; it’s also the price of peace itself. Break that system, and the conflagrations abroad will have violent echoes here at home. Trust that system, and we can manage the conflicts that tear other nations apart."
483,483,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/world/middleeast/gaza-egypt-rafah-crossing-evacuation.html,"There was little gas and no phone service in Gaza on Wednesday morning, making it impossible to hail a cab, so Ala Al Husseini nearly missed his chance to escape the war.

When someone eventually agreed to give him a ride to the border crossing with Egypt, where he could use his Austrian passport to leave Gaza, he and the driver crept through the gray, shattered streets in a state of icy dread, wondering if they could be killed in an airstrike simply for passing what Israel might consider a military target — just two more pieces of collateral damage.

As if watching a film, he pictured his children, his Ph.D., his university teaching work, his wife.

“I was thinking this could all go away just by someone pressing a button of an F-16,” said Mr. Al Husseini, 61.

Instead, by the next morning, he was safe in Cairo, hugging his brother.

“There were lots of tears,” he said by phone on Thursday, the day before he was supposed to fly to Austria to reunite with his wife and children. “Getting out of a war zone is something like a new life.”

Mr. Al Husseini was among the first few hundred people to leave Gaza since the war erupted a month ago, all of them saved by their foreign passports or other legal ties to the outside world. Weeks of intensive negotiations among Israel, Egypt, the United States, Hamas and Qatar, which often acts as a diplomatic intermediary for Hamas, had yielded an agreement for the dual citizens, foreigners and their families, as well as Palestinian staff members of international organizations, to leave Gaza through its border with Egypt.

But reaching safety was hardly as simple as showing up at the border, foreign passport in hand, as several evacuees described in interviews with The New York Times.

Some of the would-be evacuees went repeatedly to the Rafah crossing over the last three weeks after hearing it might open, only to find the gate shut. Rumors and confusion abounded as news spread that the crossing was open this week, prompting many people to head there even though they were not yet scheduled to depart. The lack of internet and spotty phone connections meant some people might not even have heard that they were on the list to leave."
484,484,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/world/middleeast/west-bank-palestinians-israel-settlers.html,"Last weekend, Bilal Mohammad Saleh, a Palestinian sidewalk vendor of sage and thyme, went out with his family to pick olives.

It is olive harvesting season in the West Bank, and Mr. Saleh was helping pluck the fruit from the gnarled trees that his family has owned for generations.

Then, four armed Jewish settlers showed up, witnesses said. They started yelling, and the olive pickers stopped what they were doing and began to run.

But Mr. Saleh forgot his phone.

“I’ll be right back,” he told his wife.

Two gunshots rang out, and in an instant, Mr. Saleh, who was known for his love of fresh leaves and being a fun dad, was face down in the olive grove, dead."
485,485,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/business/social-media-israel-hamas-conflict.html,"Deb Perelman, the best-selling cookbook author and creator of Smitten Kitchen, tends to focus her social media posts on her work, like pasta or chocolate chip cookie recipes. But days after Hamas attacked Israel, she called the violence “repugnant” on Instagram and expressed dread for “death and destruction now ahead on both sides.”

Subsequently, she posted about her newborn niece and apple picking with her children. Her direct messages immediately filled with irate notes.

“How can you post a couple of paragraphs and go on about apple pies? You are Jewish,” one user wrote. Another questioned why she “never once had a ping of conscience” about “70 years of brutal occupation.” Someone else demanded she say more, adding that Ms. Perelman looked “exactly like one of the hostages in Gaza that are being tortured and raped.”

“The fury in my DMs was unparalleled,” Ms. Perelman said in an interview, adding that she had already received a torrent of messages criticizing her “silence” before she acknowledged the attacks. “There was a feeling that I was either condoning genocide or I wasn’t calling it genocide when it happened, or I wasn’t using enough incendiary language.”

People who work across industries — from famous online influencers to those with far less prominent online profiles, including a yoga teacher, an interior designer, and tech and real estate workers — said in interviews that they faced an expectation to share their opinions about the war. The pressure is conveyed either explicitly or subtly from friends and followers. Silence is viewed by many as its own statement.

They said they realized, though, that posting came with costs, including angry outpourings and personal attacks. It’s particularly complex for those, like Ms. Perelman, whose livelihoods depend on constantly updating their feeds on topics that don’t often veer into the political.

Some people who have responded to the war publicly, particularly in support of Palestinian statehood, have faced professional repercussions, including members of Harvard student groups who were doxxed when those groups posted an open letter blaming Israel after Hamas’s attacks. The editor of Artforum was fired after the magazine’s staff published an open letter supporting Palestinian liberation, and the editor in chief of Harper’s Bazaar faced calls to resign after saying the cutoff of water and electricity to civilians in Gaza was “the most inhuman thing I’ve seen in my life.” She quickly apologized.

“You see so many posts and videos saying, ‘Your silence is deafening’ — which is a very challenging thing to respond to,” said Phoebe Lind, 24, who works at an energy start-up in Washington. She had not yet shared her opinions online about the war, though she was still weighing doing so.

Of course, many people see immense importance in posting on social media about the war. It signals support for communities being harmed and can educate followers, possibly sway decision makers and help with processing weighty emotions.

Social media feeds have focused on major news events many times before. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a uniquely thorny and divisive issue to navigate on social media, though, particularly for those not educated about the region or its history, or who are still forming their opinions.

Maddie Coppola, 25, is an interior designer in New York who typically uses Instagram to follow design trends and learn about new restaurants. Over the past two weeks, her feeds have become bifurcated, with some friends posting that they “stand with Israel” and others posting infographics about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Ms. Coppola has avoided wading into discussions on social media, because, she said, she has struggled to find information that she trusts about the conflict, and she feels that her own views are evolving. She also worries about upsetting friends or colleagues with her posts.

“I don’t want to bring this into my work life,” Ms. Coppola said. “You have to tread very carefully, especially when you’re coming from a place where you don’t feel like you know very much about what’s going on.”

The complexity and scale of the conflict can feel, to some, almost impossible to distill in posts on Instagram and X. Many sense that their friends or relatives want them to post or repost some indication of their political leanings, yet they say anything they choose to share wouldn’t capture the depth of their emotions or views.

“The current discussion of the issue feels very reductive,” said Andrey Romanov, who works in communications for a university. “There’s no room for nuance.”

Nazhath Faheema, who is Muslim and works at an interfaith charity in Singapore, said she was profoundly aware of the conflict’s impact on Muslim and Jewish communities. People of both faiths asked her to post about the war on social media, she said, and were sending her graphic images. Ms. Faheema, 38, said she had been trolled by some users asking her: “Are you even a Muslim?”

She instead opted to write a post about her decision to keep her views private as she took time to process her emotions.

“I cannot put into words the pain I’ve gone through” to decide to post on the topic, she said. “Worrying which friend is not going to be friends with me, worrying who’s going to attack me and even wondering: Are people thinking that I am just a bad person?”

The speed with which social media cycles move can breed pressure to post about news events just hours after they occur, sometimes before there are many known facts about what happened. That is complicated by the fact that on Facebook and Instagram, the Stories feature disappears after 24 hours, prompting people to keep posting fresh content.

“Places like Instagram aren’t designed for activism — they’re designed for people to engage in ads so that corporations can make money,” said Minaa B., a social worker and author with more than 270,000 Instagram followers, who uses that name professionally. “The goal is to keep you posting and keep you engaged by continuously posting.”

“It is not a space for nuance,” she said, adding that she did not post about the war. “It is not a space that often cultivates healthy dialogue in conversation.”

Witnessing the backlash toward people who have been outspoken, some social media users are posting candidly in the hopes that they will make members of their online communities feel safer and more comfortable disclosing their own views.

“A lot of people on LinkedIn don’t speak up because they’re like, ‘Oh, this is a professional network,’” said Agneez Kang, 37, who is job searching after working in retail, She uses her LinkedIn profile to express concerns about civilian deaths in Gaza, which felt important to her as a “brown woman,” she said.

“I posted knowing full on it could possibly affect my job prospects,” Ms. Kang continued. “I don’t want to work for a company that doesn’t value free speech and would penalize me for speaking up on an important topic.”

Ms. Perelman said she did not regret acknowledging the conflict. In this social environment, she said, “if people are going to be furious at me for something they think that I think, I’d rather they be furious at me for things I actually do think.”

Ms. Perelman shared her experience with the hateful messages on Instagram and used it as a call for donations to World Central Kitchen, the global nonprofit organization that delivers fresh meals to people in need during crises, raising upward of $180,000. That, to her, showed that people wanted to pivot their helpless, frustrated energy into a productive place, she said.

“When you’re public and you have open DMs, you’re a lightning rod for this,” she added. “I empathize with people, with all of us, who are hurting and don’t know what to do with this frustration — I just wish people understood that screaming into a cookbook author’s DMs is not bringing the hostages home.”

486,486,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-gaza-aid-fundraiser.html,"Saudi Arabia on Thursday announced a government campaign to collect humanitarian aid for Gaza, gathering more than 60,000 donations worth more than $17 million in its first few hours.

The campaign was announced more than three weeks into the war between Hamas and Israel, which has cut off electricity, water and food for more than two million Palestinians living in Gaza. The effort was begun noticeably later than prior Saudi aid campaigns that were started within days of regional crises — such as the February earthquakes in Turkey and Syria — a delay that appeared consistent with the Saudi government’s somewhat ambivalent response to the conflict.

On one hand, Saudi officials have issued a stream of statements condemning Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, urgently pleading for a cease-fire and calling for the establishment of a Palestinian state. King Salman kicked off the state aid campaign on Thursday with an $8 million donation, while his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, donated around $5.3 million, the kingdom announced.

At the same time, many Saudis say they have picked up signals that public displays of pro-Palestinian sentiment are not entirely welcomed by their authoritarian government — especially since the Biden administration revealed this year that it was talking to the Saudi leadership about a potential deal in which the kingdom would establish diplomatic relations with Israel.

This week, a British actor who wore a keffiyeh — a checkered scarf widely viewed as a symbol of Palestinian nationalism — while visiting the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia said that the authorities there had briefly detained him, interrogated him and confiscated the scarf. The Saudi government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the episode.

The kingdom has not formally designated Hamas, the armed group that rules Gaza and carried out the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, as a terrorist organization. But in 2019, Saudi authorities detained and prosecuted several Palestinian residents of the kingdom who had connections to Hamas, according to human rights organizations. Saudi authorities appear to implicitly classify Hamas as terrorist group by viewing it as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, which they designated a terrorist organization in 2014.

Because the government maintains strict controls on charitable giving — originally put in place over counterterrorism concerns — the initial lack of a state-led campaign meant that some Saudis found it difficult to send aid to Gazans, despite a groundswell of popular support for them in the kingdom.

That sentiment was evident on Thursday when the Saudi relief campaign, arranged through the government’s King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center, collected tens of thousands of donations within a few hours. The head of the center, Abdulaziz Al Rabea, said the campaign was a reflection of “the kingdom’s historic role of standing beside the brotherly Palestinian people throughout various crises,” according to a statement published by the official Saudi Press Agency.

Asked about the timing of the aid campaign, a spokesperson for the center said that the kingdom “has always been at the forefront of aiding Palestinian people” and that the organization has long supported Palestinians through “many projects,” including in partnership with the United Nations.

In contrast, the neighboring United Arab Emirates launched its own humanitarian relief campaign for Gaza on Oct. 13, days after Israel began a siege of the enclave in response to the Hamas attacks. Thousands of volunteers have gathered to assemble aid packages for Gazans, a notable display in a country where public expressions of solidarity with the Palestinians have been muted since the authoritarian government established ties with Israel in 2020.

On Wednesday, the Emirati ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, ordered officials to arrange medical treatment at Emirati hospitals for 1,000 Palestinian children from Gaza, according to a statement published by the state news agency. Barely any Palestinians have been allowed to leave the blockaded territory since the war began, and the statement did not include details on how the children and their families would be brought there from Gaza. It said only that the Emirates would “provide them with medical treatment prior to their safe return home.”

487,487,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/world/middleeast/gaza-evacuations.html,"As people waited at the Rafah crossing on Thursday anticipating a second day of evacuations from Gaza into Egypt, the sound of an airstrike rattled the crowd, and a piece of shrapnel appeared to fall in the area.

The blast was just another sign that for many, the trip to safety was one of the riskiest endeavors they had undertaken in Gaza.

“Reaching Rafah crossing was the most dangerous trip in my entire life,” Ala Al Husseini, 61, an Austrian citizen who evacuated on Wednesday, wrote in a text message from the bus that took him from Rafah to Cairo.

Reached by phone on Thursday after arriving in Cairo, he said that he had not been able to find any taxis or people who would drive him to the border because of a shortage of fuel in the Gaza Strip, and because phones were not working. Eventually he found a ride, but he and the driver were terrified while driving from central Gaza on the enclave’s empty streets.

Mr. Al Husseini said he feared that simply being next to a place that Israel considered a Hamas target could get him killed. “You could be collateral damage any time,” he said. “I was scared to death.”

Gaza’s border crossing authority released the names of about 600 more foreign nationals it said would be allowed to leave through the Rafah crossing on Thursday. The list included 400 Americans as well as people from Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belgium, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, Sri Lanka, and Switzerland.

Hisham Adwan, the Rafah crossing’s Gaza spokesman, said that more than 340 foreign nationals had traveled through the crossing on Thursday, along with 21 wounded people and 21 others escorting them. Additionally, 45 aid trucks had crossed into the battered enclave, he said.

The numbers of transiting people were similar to those the day before, when 361 foreign nationals entered Egypt, and ambulances carried 45 severely injured Palestinians, along with some of their family members, to Egyptian hospitals, according to Al Qahera, an Egyptian state-owned television channel.

Photos from Gaza on Thursday showed scores of people waiting at the crossing, and Egyptian television showed people pushing luggage carts on the other side of the checkpoint.

Mr. Al Husseini said that the scene at the border was chaotic. Officers were processing names manually, he said, and people who were not among the few hundred people being allowed out were among the crowds, some trying to leave.

Family members of those who could evacuate were sometimes barred from leaving, because they did not have foreign citizenship or the necessary documents, forcing people into difficult decisions.

Adala Abu Middain, a Palestinian with Egyptian citizenship, went to the crossing on Thursday with her sister, Dalal, and Dalal’s 6-year-old daughter, Maha, both of whom have American citizenship, she said. But she said that when they arrived at the crossing they were told that the niece could not leave.

“We just want one thing: Help us to leave Gaza,” Ms. Abu Middain said.

It was unclear what the holdup was, and the American Embassy in Cairo did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.

Matthew Miller, a State Department spokesman, said Wednesday that around 400 Americans in Gaza had expressed a desire to leave, but that the government would also help their family members who wish to flee, for a total of about a thousand people. Still, some names were not on the list on Thursday.

Mkhaimar Abu Sada, 58, an associate professor of political science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, was accompanying his two sons, both in their 20s, at the Rafah crossing on Thursday. He said they had American citizenship, but that he was not allowed to leave because he has only an American green card. His wife and three other children are not American and will stay behind as well.

He is hoping they will all eventually be able to get out. “The situation is beyond catastrophic and beyond even imagination,” he said. “The death, bombing, bloodshed.”

Lena Beseiso, 57, an American who had come to the crossing repeatedly only to find it closed, was finally traveling through it on Thursday with her family. But her feelings were bittersweet.

“It’s so sad that we have to leave all those innocent people behind,” she said in a voice note.

With universities across the United States grappling with a rise in antisemitism since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, elite law firms are putting schools on notice. In a letter to some of the nation’s top law schools obtained by DealBook, about two dozen major Wall Street firms warned that what happens on campus could have corporate consequences.

“We look to you to ensure your students who hope to join our firms after graduation are prepared to be an active part of workplace communities that have zero tolerance policies for any form of discrimination or harassment, much less the kind that has been taking place on some law school campuses,” the firms wrote.

The letter follows a series of recent antisemitic episodes at universities. Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York sought this week to reassure Jewish students at Cornell after online posts threatening violence against them. Students at other schools have said they feel increasingly unsafe amid rallies and other acts that, in some instances, have become violent."
489,489,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/opinion/israel-hamas-gaza-children.html,"One reason I’m afraid that the worst is yet to come in the Middle East is that the mutual dehumanization is the most savage I’ve ever seen in decades of on-the-ground reporting in the region.

Israel’s invasion of Gaza is destroying tunnels, ammunition dumps and Hamas fighters, yes. But I’m afraid it’s also helping to pulverize the recognition of shared humanity that in the long run allows people to live beside one another in peace. The poisonous hatred in turn is already spilling over to the United States and other countries worldwide.

I was thinking about this as I drove the other day to meet some Gazans who were temporarily allowed to visit Israel and became stuck in East Jerusalem. My Israeli taxi driver refused to enter the Palestinian neighborhood (“If I go there, I won’t make it out”) and finally abandoned me on the side of the road to get a Palestinian taxi. And then when I got to my destination, I interviewed a sweet 57-year-old Gazan woman who was talking to me about the war and told me that she approved of Hamas’s attacks on Israeli civilians.

I pressed her, and she insisted it was fine even to kill a 5-year-old Israeli child, because “they are all Jews and Zionists.”

That conversation pretty much broke my heart. Such bigotry is nurtured by Hamas propaganda but also by Israeli bombing of Gaza: The woman said she had lost two cousins to Israeli fire, including a young woman married only a year ago, and she weeps daily at the bombardment of family and friends in Gaza.

Meanwhile, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the escalation of the ground operation on Saturday, he cited biblical references to the Amalekites, who were the target of a divine genocide. In the story, God’s order was: “put to death men and women, children and infants.” Netanyahu wasn’t advocating that literal policy, but Amalek is a code word that regularly crops up in Israeli politics for a ruthless enemy that must be crushed without mercy.

Some have been more explicit in their biblical exegesis.

“You may think you’re being merciful” by sparing a child, counsels a far-right rabbi in a chilling video posted online, but actually “you’re being vicious to the ultimate victim that this child will grow up and kill.” And this, too, breaks my heart.

There are of course many other voices that are merciful and sensible, and I’ve highlighted them previously. But when children on both sides are slaughtered and people are fearful, it is extremists who invariably are ascendant.

That is the longtime pattern in the Middle East: It was Palestinian suicide bombers who propelled Benjamin Netanyahu into the prime minister’s office, and it has been Israeli hard-liners who fuel extremist Palestinian groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

“Extremists need each other, support each other,” Eyad al-Sarraj, a Gaza psychiatrist who died in 2013, once lamented to me. He complained that Israel’s blockade of Gaza since 2007 had turned Hamas fanatics into popular heroes.

Now I fear we face a prolonged war that will make the dehumanization on both sides much worse."

Sometimes, phones rang and rang unanswered. Other times, callers were greeted with a somber recorded message: “Contact with the beloved Gaza Strip was lost as a result of the ongoing aggression,” a voice said. “May God protect Gaza and its people.”

“This is getting more insane every day,” Yousef Hammash, an employee of the Norwegian Refugee Council who was born in the Jabaliya neighborhood hit by the airstrike, said Wednesday.

The screens showed the faces of students beneath the words “Columbia’s Leading Antisemites.” The students said the photographs were taken from a “private and secure” online platform for students at the School of International and Public Affairs.

They demanded “immediate legal support for affected students” and “a commitment to student safety, well being and privacy.”

The students whose images appeared on the video panels were members of groups that had signed a statement about the war in the Middle East that said, in part, “The weight of responsibility for the war and casualties undeniably lies with the Israeli extremist government.”

As Dr. Yarhi-Milo and Mrs. Clinton’s class was finishing around 4 p.m., the demonstrators shushed themselves into silence, anticipating that the dean and the former secretary of state would soon walk past the gathered students. That time never came. Word spread that Dr. Yarhi-Milo and Mrs. Clinton had left the building through a side door.

Mr. Gill’s assessment echoes those of other analysts. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said last month that “this may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,” and described the conflict in Gaza as “the highest and most important thing for the Western world.”

The recent economic troubles have been fueled by deepening geopolitical conflicts that span continents. Tensions between the United States and China over technology transfers and security only complicate efforts to work together on other problems like climate change, debt relief or violent regional conflicts.

The overriding political preoccupations also mean that traditional monetary and fiscal tools like adjusting interest rates or government spending may be less effective.

The brutal fighting between Israel and Hamas has already taken the lives of thousands of civilians and inflicted wrenching misery on both sides. If the conflict stays contained, though, the ripple effects on the world economy are likely to remain limited, most analysts agree.

Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, said on Wednesday that “it isn’t clear at this point that the conflict in the Middle East is on track to have significant economic effects” on the United States, but he added, “That doesn’t mean it isn’t incredibly important.”

Mideast oil producers do not dominate the market the way they did in the 1970s, when Arab nations drastically cut production and imposed an embargo on the United States and some other countries after a coalition led by Egypt and Syria attacked Israel.

At the moment, the United States is the world’s largest oil producer, and alternative and renewable energy sources make up a bit more of the world’s energy mix.

“It’s a highly volatile, uncertain, scary situation,” said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. But there is “a recognition among most of the parties, the U.S., Europe, Iran, other gulf countries,” he continued, referring to the Persian Gulf, “that it’s in no one’s interest for this conflict to significantly expand beyond Israel and Gaza.”

Mr. Bordoff added that missteps, poor communication and misunderstandings, however, could push countries to escalate even if they didn’t want to.

And a significant and sustained drop in the global supply of oil — whatever the reasons — could simultaneously slow growth and inflame inflation, a cursed combination known as stagflation."

As Israeli forces neared Gaza City yesterday, a multinational deal allowed scores of people — including seriously wounded Palestinians and some with dual nationalities — to enter Egypt from Gaza. They were the first such exits from Gaza since the start of the war.

By last night, buses had ferried 361 foreign nationals over the border to Egypt, and ambulances had carried 45 severely injured Palestinians and some of their family members to Egyptian hospitals, an Egyptian state-owned television channel reported. Here’s what we know about the deal, which was negotiated late Tuesday between Israel, Egypt, Hamas, the U.S. and Qatar.

American citizens were not expected to be among the first group of evacuees, other than those working for certain aid groups, but they were planned to follow in batches later in the week, diplomats said.

Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. agency for Palestinians and the most senior official to be allowed into Gaza since the war began, said his agency was running out of fuel, water, food and medicine, and “will soon be unable to operate.” Martin Griffiths, the U.N. aid chief, said that a pause in fighting offered the only viable option for delivering sufficient aid.

The future: Some diplomats and analysts say the Hamas-Israel war may breathe new life into the long-discounted two-state solution. Iranian officials are publicly signaling that they do not want a full-scale war.

Thousands of foreign passport holders and people affiliated with international organizations are set to evacuate to Egypt starting on Wednesday. Several seriously injured Palestinians arrived on Wednesday, Egyptian state TV and a local medical official said, and hundreds of foreign passport holders were moving through checkpoints at the Rafah border crossing.

More were to follow in the coming days, according to Gazan authorities and Western diplomats.

The agreement to allow them to cross came together late on Tuesday in talks that have been continuing among Israel, Egypt, Hamas, the United States and Qatar.

496,496,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/world/middleeast/israel-palestine-two-state-solution.html,"“There has to be a vision of what comes next,” President Biden said last week of the war between Israel and Hamas. “In our view, it has to be a two-state solution.” The surest path to peace, said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain, is a two-state solution, a sentiment echoed by President Emmanuel Macron of France.

At first glance, their words seemed like a sepia-tinted throwback: invoking, as a remedy for the worst eruption of bloodshed between Israelis and Palestinians in many years, the faded relic of a peace process that many on both sides viewed as dead and buried some time late in the Obama administration.

And yet, the two-state solution — Israelis and Palestinians living side-by-side in their own sovereign countries — is getting a new hearing, not just in foreign-policy circles in Washington, London and Paris but also, more quietly, among the combatants themselves. In part, it reflects the lack of any other viable alternative.

“We cannot return to a pattern where every other year, there is a violent confrontation between Israel and Hamas,” said Gilead Sher, who helped lead Israel’s negotiations with the Palestinians in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when the two sides arguably came closest to striking a two-state settlement.

“If America engages in what President Biden has stated he would commit to, there is a chance,” he said. “There is a chance for negotiations that could provide a step-by-step process to two distinct states.”"
497,497,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/opinion/mike-johnson-israel-ukraine.html,"It didn’t take long for the new House speaker, Mike Johnson, to demonstrate to the world that he will not be a serious partner for American allies or for those who still believe that governing is not a petty little game.

On Monday, only five days after being elevated to one of the most important leadership roles in the country, he upended a major foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, meekly obeying those Republican House members who see their main role as disengaging from the world and taking self-destructive potshots at Democrats. Nothing in Mr. Johnson’s record suggested he might try to shore up America’s leadership in the world, but his actions show that his new position has not added any gravitas to his thinking; he’s just pandering to his cronies in the far right wing.

Specifically, he stripped money for Ukraine and Taiwan from the $105 billion package requested by President Biden, leaving only the $14.3 billion the administration wants to send to Israel. But then he imposed a condition on the Israel money: Mr. Biden must agree to cut the same amount out of the money the Internal Revenue Service uses to chase down high-income tax cheats. So essentially the U.S. can protect Israel as long as it also protects rich white-collar criminals.

The I.R.S., of course, has nothing to do with the war between Israel and Hamas, but it has everything to do with the Republican desire to score political points whenever possible. Ever since Mr. Biden won $80 billion for stronger I.R.S. enforcement in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, Republicans have made that money a target, exploiting the agency’s Sheriff of Nottingham public image by trying to delude ordinary taxpayers into believing the extra funds meant the agency was coming after them.

But the aim of the extra enforcement was always the wealthy, whose complex tax fraud schemes cost the Treasury billions every year. Reducing the I.R.S. budget would actually widen the deficit, the opposite of what Republicans claim they care about. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that if the I.R.S. enforcement budget is cut by $25 billion, as some Senate Republicans have proposed, it would cost $49 billion in revenue from auditing the rich and widen the 10-year deficit by nearly $24 billion.

Another study published this year by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that every additional dollar spent on auditing high-income taxpayers yielded $12 in new revenue for the Treasury. By that calculation, Mr. Johnson’s stunt could cost the country $171.6 billion. This year, Republicans forced Mr. Biden to cut $20 billion from the I.R.S. as part of the price for avoiding a debt default; having shown that the White House would agree to chip away at a top priority to prevent a crisis, they are returning to the same playbook.

But in the end, the I.R.S. cut isn’t really going to happen, as House Republicans know, because Mr. Johnson’s bill will die in the Senate, where many leading Republicans already oppose it. Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, has made it clear the final bill will have to include money for Ukraine, and hawks like Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have said the Ukraine money was related to Israel’s war against Hamas.

“Hamas was just hosted by the Russians in Moscow,” Mr. Graham said, adding, about Ukraine, “I think breaking them out sends the wrong signal.”

Other Republicans, like Senator Mitt Romney of Utah and Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina, agreed with the White House that cutting the I.R.S. budget made little sense in the context of national security.

But making sense isn’t really Mr. Johnson’s game. He’s got a few calculations going on that show the kind of cynical strategic planning that currently passes for politics in the House. By throwing in the I.R.S. cut, he gets to show the same extremists who deposed his predecessor that he can play rough with the White House. The move will presumably get some House Democrats to vote against the bill, and then Republicans can run misleading attack ads saying those Democrats oppose aid to Israel, as many members are already anticipating.

“The new Republican speaker has chosen to put a poison pill” in the aid bill, Representative Ritchie Torres, Democrat of New York, told Axios. “The politicizing of Israel in a time of war is nothing short of disgraceful.”

And then, assuming the bill does pass the House, Mr. Johnson will then get a seat at the table to negotiate with the Senate and the White House on the final legislation. If the House can’t pass anything, it will have less leverage in determining the final amount of aid.

If Mr. Johnson has substantive objections to helping Ukraine and Israel that justify the legislative impediments he is constructing, he should state what they are. There is room for a debate over conditions that could be imposed on military aid for Israel, including a detailed plan to protect civilians in the Gaza campaign or, as my colleague Thomas Friedman has suggested, an agreement not to construct one new settlement in the West Bank outside of existing settlement blocs and to rebuild the Palestinian Authority and the two-state solution at the expense of Hamas.

But that would require a serious discussion with serious people. And Mr. Johnson has now shown that he has no place in that room."

My name is Hala Alyan, and I’m a Palestinian-American clinical psychologist and poet and novelist. I was born in the United States, spent the first few years of my life in Kuwait, and then after Saddam’s invasion, came to the US. My parents sought asylum, and we lived here until I was about 12.

I have had what I’ve come recently to see as the privilege of having spent my adolescence and young adulthood in the Middle East, in countries like the United Arab Emirates, like Lebanon, places where being Palestinian was sort of seen as kind of an undeniable fact. It was not something that I had to debate with people. And then when I came back to the US for grad school, and I’ve been here ever since, I started to learn things about what it meant to be Palestinian, particularly as an adult.

When I returned to the United States in my early 20s, a week after I arrived, I had an experience at a bar where I started to speak with somebody who had just returned from a birthright trip, birthright being a free heritage trip to Israel and Jerusalem for young adults of Jewish heritage, and was telling them about the fact that I had just moved here from Beirut. And I said something about being Palestinian.

And she and the people that she was with turned it into an inquiry of why it is that I felt like I had to use that word, why it is that I had to use that language when one could communicate where one was from by just saying Arab or Arab-American. And it has continued to be sort of a formative experience. And that’s why I wrote about the phenomenon of Palestinians needing to audition for empathy.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

In the past couple of weeks, I’ve watched Palestinian activists, lawyers, professors get baited and interrupted on air, if not silenced altogether. They are being made to sing for the supper of airtime and fair coverage. They are begging reporters to do the most basic tasks of their job. At the same time, Palestinians fleeing from bombs have been misidentified. Even when under attack, they must be costumed as another people to elicit humanity. Even in death, they cannot rest.

In 2017, I published a novel about a Palestinian family. It was published by a respectable publisher, got a lot of lovely press, was given a book tour. I spoke on panels to book clubs. I answered questions after readings. There was a refrain that kept coming up. People kept commenting on how human the story was. You’ve humanized the conflict. This is a human story.

Of course, literature and the arts play a crucial role in providing context, expanding our empathy, granting us glimpses into other worlds, but every time I was told I’d humanized the Palestinians, I would have to suppress the question it invoked. What had they been before?

A couple of weeks ago, in a professional space, someone called Palestinians by name and spoke of the seven decades of their anguish. I sat among dozens of coworkers and realized my lip was quivering. I was crying before I understood it was happening. I fled the room, and it took 10 minutes for me to stop sobbing. I didn’t immediately understand my reaction.

Over the years, I’ve faced meetings, classrooms, and other institutional spaces where Palestinians went unnamed or were referred to only as terrorists. I came of professional age in a country where people lost all sorts of things for speaking of Palestine — social standing, university tenure, journalist positions. But in the end, I am undone not by silence or erasure, but by empathy, by the simple naming of my people, by increasing recognition that liberation is linked, by spaces of Palestinian-Jewish solidarity, by what has become controversial — the simple speaking aloud of Palestinian suffering.

These days, everyone is trying to write about the children, an incomprehensible number of them dead and counting. We are up at night, combing through the flickering light of our phones, trying to find the metaphor, the clip, the photograph to prove a child is a child. It is an unbearable task. We ask, will this be the image that finally does it, this half child on a rooftop? This video reposted by Al-Jazeera of an inconsolable girl appearing to recognize her mother’s body among the dead, screaming out, it’s her, it’s her! I swear it’s her. I know her from her hair.

Take it from a writer. There is nothing like the tedium of trying to come up with analogies. There is something humiliating in trying to earn solidarity. I keep seeing infographics desperately trying to appeal to American audiences. Imagine most of the population of Manhattan being told to evacuate in 24 hours. Look, here’s a strip on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea. That’s Gaza. It is about the same size as Philadelphia, or multiply the entire population of Las Vegas by three.

I don’t hesitate for a second to condemn the killing of any child, any massacre of civilians. This, of course, includes Jewish life. It is the easiest ask in the world. And it is not in spite of that, but because of that, I say condemn the brutalization of bodies. By all means, do. Condemn murder, condemn violence, imprisonment, all forms of oppression.

But if your shock and distress comes only at the sight of certain brutalized bodies, if you speak out but not when Palestinian bodies are besieged and murdered, abducted, and imprisoned, then it is worth asking yourself, which brutalization is acceptable to you, even quietly, even subconsciously, and which is not. Name the discrepancy and own it. If you can’t be equitable, be honest.

There is nothing complicated about asking for freedom. Palestinians deserve equal rights, equal access to resources, equal access to fair elections, and so forth. If this makes you uneasy, then you must ask yourself why. Here is the truth of the diasporic Palestinians. They are not magically diasporic. Their diaspora is a direct result of, often, violent, intentional, and illegal dispossession.

One day, a house is yours. One day, it is not. One day, a neighborhood is yours. One day, it is not. One day, a territory is yours. One day, it is not. This same sort of dispossession is grounded in the same mindset and international complicity that is playing out in Gaza. It matters where you start a narrative. Diasporically or not, being Palestinian is the quintessential disruptor. We exist and our existence presents an existential affront. As long as we exist, we challenge several falsehoods, not the least of which is that for some, we never existed at all.

But decades ago, a country was born in the delicious, glittering expanse of nothingness, a birthright, something due. Our very existence challenges a formidable, militarized narrative. But the days of the Palestine exception are numbered. Palestine is increasingly becoming the litmus test for true liberatory practice. In the meantime, Palestinians continue to be cast paradoxically, both terror and invisible, both people who never existed and people who cannot return. Imagine being such a pest, such an obstacle, or imagine being so powerful."
499,499,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/world/europe/europe-antisemitism-israel-hamas.html,"Perhaps not since the Holocaust, which saw the annihilation of about two-thirds of Europe’s Jewish community, have the Jews of Europe lived in an atmosphere of fear so acute that it feels like a fundamental shift in the terms of their existence.

Across a Europe of daubed Stars of David on apartment buildings, bomb threats to Jewish stores and demonstrations calling for Israel’s eradication, Jews speak of alarm as pro-Palestinian sentiment surges.

“There is a feeling of helplessness that has never been experienced before,” said Joel Rubinfeld of the Belgian League Against Anti-Semitism.

The Oct. 7 Hamas assault on Israel, often described as the largest single-day slaughter of Jews since Hitler’s program of extermination, has awakened a repressed horror in Jewish populations, now compounded by dismay at the way the world’s sympathy has rapidly shifted to the Palestinians in Gaza being killed under Israeli bombardment.

“What strikes me is there is a wave of antisemitism in the world when 1,300 Jews were massacred a few days ago,” said Samuel Lejoyeux, the president of the Union of Jewish Students of France, which includes 15,000 members.

This feels, to many European Jews, like the same blindness or insouciance that allowed millions of their forebears to be sent to Nazi camps to be gassed. It is precisely to that time that images of slain Jewish babies and grandmothers in the Jewish homeland have transported them.

This month, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany’s president, said at a rally held at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin that it was “intolerable that Jewish people are today once again living in fear — in our country, of all places.” In the week after the Hamas attack, the German federal agency that monitors antisemitism documented 202 episodes, a rise of 240 percent compared with the same period last year.

“Wir Haben Angst,” or “We Are Scared,” was the headline across this week’s cover of Der Spiegel, the leading German newsmagazine, over photographs of four German Jews, one of them a 90-year-old Holocaust survivor, Ivar Buterfas-Frankenthal, who said, “We Jews are once again easy targets.”"
500,500,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/world/middleeast/egypt-rafah-crossing-gaza-israel.html,"On the far side of the Sinai Peninsula, about a six-hour drive from Cairo through a largely empty Egyptian desert, the Rafah crossing is a dun-colored expanse of sand, concrete and not much else. Isolated from the rest of the Egypt by not only distance but also heavy military restriction, Rafah can feel as distant from world events as any place on the planet.

Yet over the last three weeks of Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza, Rafah has become the focus of heated negotiations, a place where many people, both powerful and powerless, have pinned their waning hopes. With Israel imposing a suffocating siege on the densely populated enclave, Rafah has become the only entry into the strip for aid to get to its population of 2.3 million people. So far, nothing and no one has been able to come out of Gaza.

But that may soon change: Egypt told the Gazan authorities that it would take in 81 seriously wounded people from Gaza and treat them in Egyptian hospitals on Wednesday, according to a statement from Gaza’s General Authority for Crossings and Borders.

Egypt’s control of the Rafah crossing has given it prominent status as one of Gaza’s main benefactors and an important player in the conflict, a position that analysts say could help it unlock more international financial support amid a crushing economic crisis in the North African nation. Egypt highlighted that role on Tuesday, when the government took reporters on a tightly controlled trip to Rafah.

Aid trucks and army tanks lined the dusty road leading to the crossing. Dozens of volunteers from government-sponsored aid groups and the Egyptian Red Crescent milled about. Several ambulances sat just inside the huge archway framing the crossing.

“From the very first minute, we’ve been sending convoys of assistance from our organizations, and volunteers have been staying here around the clock for days,” Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said in a short news conference, as crowds of volunteers carrying Egyptian flags and pro-Palestinian signs gathered to listen. “Egypt has shouldered the burden of the Palestinian issue for years.”

Yet, partly because of factors beyond Egypt’s control, Rafah can meet only a fraction of Gaza’s needs. Just 241 trucks of aid have reached Gaza since its gates opened two weeks ago after negotiations between the United States, Israel, Egypt and the U.N., a paltry number given the scale of the humanitarian need, aid officials say.

Israel, which is carrying out stringent inspections of aid trucks, had been the main player slowing the process, according to the U.N., the European Union, and Egyptian and U.S. officials. But Israel has now agreed to allow in about 80 trucks per day, according to two Western diplomats briefed on the negotiations, still short of the 100 per day the U.N. says are needed.

On Tuesday, 83 trucks arrived in Gaza, said Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing.

David M. Satterfield, the U.S. special envoy assigned to shepherd humanitarian issues in the conflict, said in Cairo on Sunday that aid needed to flow far more quickly in order to show increasingly distressed Gazans that they did not need to resort to looting U.N. warehouses for sustenance, as happened several days ago.

“This is a society on edge and desperate,” he said, adding that agencies distributing assistance “must be able to demonstrate that aid is not episodic.”

Negotiators have also been pressing to evacuate people in Gaza who hold foreign passports and their families, along with staff of foreign embassies and international organizations. Over the past three weeks, people have rushed to the Gaza side of the gate multiple times after being told they could cross, only to find it shut. The United States has publicly blamed Hamas, the political and military organization that controls the enclave, while Egypt has publicly blamed Israel, saying it has made the crossing unsafe by repeatedly bombing the Gaza side.

But nobody is publicly blaming Egypt, though Western diplomats involved in the evacuation effort say that Egypt’s fears — including that a throng of desperate people could try to break through to Egypt as soon as the gate opens — are also playing a role in foreign nationals’ continued inability to evacuate.

There is still a chance that an agreement could come together for people with foreign passports to leave. But Egypt has made clear that it would not accept large numbers of Palestinian refugees on its soil, a proposal that some in the international community, including Israel, have reportedly floated. Mr. Madbouly categorically rejected such an idea, as did volunteers at the gate.

“No, no, no, it’s not a solution, and I refuse this solution,” said Mustafa Mouftah, 30, a university lecturer from the nearby Egyptian city of El Arish who started volunteering as a translator at Rafah a week ago. “This is our land, and we love this land.”

Mr. Satterfield said on Sunday that the United States also did not consider it to be an option, saying that the Biden administration respected Egypt’s sovereignty and that it believed that “the future of the Palestinian people of Gaza is in Gaza.”

Re “What I Believe as a Historian of Genocide,” by Omer Bartov (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Nov. 10):

Mr. Bartov, a Holocaust scholar, warns that Israel is very likely committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza that can devolve into genocide. To show “genocidal intent,” he cites furious Israeli statements made immediately after Oct. 7.

But these do not reflect actual Israeli policies toward civilians. Israel’s targets are military: Hamas’s soldiers, tunnels, headquarters and weapons stocks. By placing military targets in and under civilian structures, it is Hamas that violates laws of war.

The 1948 U.N. Genocide Convention mentions demonstrable intent to destroy a national, racial or religious group. Mr. Bartov is mute about Israel’s hundreds of phone calls to Gazans warning them to leave buildings in which Hamas fighters were located. Israel has urged civilians to evacuate to the south to escape battle. A government intent on genocide would do the opposite.

A cease-fire now would leave Hamas’s leadership and its massive tunnel structures intact. Hamas would declare victory and prepare for the next round of killing. Mr. Bartov’s article and the demonstrations around the world accusing Israel of genocide would, intentionally or not, have the effect of consigning Israel to live next to a terrorist state committed to its destruction. No state in the world would accept such a situation.

To the Editor:

In an urgent effort to prevent genocide, Omer Bartov writes about the horrific carnage committed by Israel in Gaza. He also speaks forcefully about the massacre by Hamas. In the course of doing it, just by doing it, he also illustrates the total insanity of “rules of war.” I say this with great respect for what he is trying to do.

But to live and die in a world that makes distinctions between crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, proportionality, etc., you can lose sight how all of it is utter madness. Just as “no option is off the table” means that nuclear war is somehow a rational final option. Equally disturbing is that anything short of that might be considered acceptable.

Re “Measuring Israel by the Yardstick of a ‘Just War,’” by A. Walter Dorn (Opinion guest essay, Nov. 13):

Professor Dorn examines whether Israel is adhering to the moral framework of “just war” theory. Yet he reveals himself to be unserious when he suggests that Israel should negotiate with Hamas because “negotiation with adversaries, however distasteful, has often proven successful.”

Hamas leaders have made it quite clear that they have no interest in peace with Israel. They wish to destroy the Jewish state and slaughter its Jewish inhabitants. Just ask them.

The only chance for peace is for Hamas to be removed from the equation. Tragically, many Palestinian civilians who are being used as human shields will lose their lives in the process.

To the Editor:

The plight of the Palestinian civilians in Gaza has captured attention around the world. Supplies of food, medicine, water and fuel are desperately needed. The situation in the hospitals is especially concerning.

These problems can be alleviated quickly, and the power to do this lies with Hamas. Release all the hostages in return for a cease-fire. Move any Hamas fighters at the hospitals elsewhere so that the hospitals are no longer in the battlefield.

Many demonstrations around the world are well motivated but are not aimed at the proper target: Hamas.

Senator Sanders states what has been obvious for decades to all who support two states living in peace, prosperity and dignity: The violence must end. The question is, how?

Each act of brutality radicalizes the other side. In this long struggle, extremists on both sides scuttle every hope for compromise and ensure the endless cycle of murder and retaliation.

The U.S. can pressure Israel by curtailing or attaching conditions to aid. Who or what can pressure Hamas and its allies? What, specifically, can disempower the Islamic radicals, defang the Israeli settlers and offer a path toward a commitment to peaceful coexistence on both sides?

Those who claim that Hamas’s war is somehow justified by Israeli actions (heinous as they may be) ignore its stated goal of eradicating Israel and killing Jews. Ultimately, this is a regional problem that requires a regional solution.

Senator Sanders and other peace-loving Americans must call on those Arab states that support Palestinian extremists to end their support and work toward genuine transformation.

I support Senator Sanders’s vision, but he doesn’t propose a concrete path forward, without which nothing will change.

To the Editor:

While Senator Bernie Sanders offers what he believes to be constructive steps for Israel-Palestinian rapprochement, his prescription places nearly all of the obligations upon Israel. Of the 1,517 words in the senator’s essay, only these 13 words — “new Palestinian leadership will be required as part of a wider political process” — are demanded of the Palestinians. Not enough, in my opinion.

Here are just a handful of steps the Palestinians could take to demonstrate seriousness and good faith: Once and for all recognize Israel’s right to exist as an independent and sovereign Jewish state; hold free and fair Palestinian elections to put into place the new leadership Senator Sanders calls for; demand, without equivocation, Hamas’s permanent removal from Gaza and reject its political ideology committed to Israel’s destruction; cease providing financial compensation to the families of individuals who commit acts of terror against Israelis; remove antisemitic and historically inaccurate propaganda contained in textbooks used in Palestinian schools; reject the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (B.D.S.) movement targeted against Israel; and, finally, demonstrate a willingness to accept the peace proposals offered by Israel in previous rounds of failed negotiations, proposals that were continually rejected by the Palestinians under Yasir Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas.

Senator Sanders has articulated what Israel must do to advance peace in his view, but in order to balance the peace equation there is clearly much that the Palestinians can and must do to end the perpetual cycle of violence.

Senator Bernie Sanders’s essay was well balanced, educational and pragmatic.

I wish the senator would have completed his comparison of deaths to date in the Gaza war. While the equivalent of 1,200 Israeli deaths on a per capita basis in the United States would be a shocking 40,000 lives, Senator Sanders didn’t say what the equivalent of 12,000 Palestinian deaths would be.

Perhaps he did the math and didn’t want to write down the unimaginable figure of almost two million.

I hope for a resolution of this war so there are no more needless civilian deaths on either side.

“Behind Acts of Violence, Years of Mistakes” (front page, Nov. 21) effectively underscores the decades of neglect, underfunding and mismanagement that have made New York’s mental health system such a resounding failure for so many people in our city. But it also perpetuates dangerous stereotypes about people who are homeless and makes assumptions about the value of “mental health shelters” that do not comport with reality.

The breakdowns in the social safety net for people living with mental illness are indeed an urgent problem, but those breakdowns affect all people living with mental illness, not just those without homes. By focusing only on homeless individuals — and on what is statistically a small number of violent actions by some of those individuals — you are feeding into the misperception of homeless New Yorkers as deranged and dangerous.

In reality, as you note, individuals who are homeless are much more likely to be the victims than the perpetrators of crimes.

While the legal right to shelter is critical to ensuring that thousands more people are not relegated to sleeping on our streets or in the transit system, shelters — including mental health shelters — are in no way appropriate settings for individuals with severe mental illness. In fact, our clients in those shelters often report that those environments exacerbate their symptoms, rather than support their needs."

Senator Schumer’s resolve to take a strong public stand against antisemitism is laudable, particularly when the scourge of hatred toward Jews is reaching a fever pitch. The Senate majority leader’s felicitous and poignant plea, both on the floor of the Senate and in the Opinion section, was notable for its moral clarity and forceful denunciation of the wanton antisemitism pervading every segment of our society.

Furthermore, the urgency with which he conveyed how dangerous this conflagration of hate has become and how critical it is for all Americans — not just Jews — to condemn antisemitism is a clarion call that will hopefully resonate on all points of the political spectrum, on university campuses and throughout our nation.

Re “The Question of Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism,” by Charles M. Blow (column, Nov. 16):

The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s working definition of antisemitism, adopted by dozens of countries around the world, indeed does define anti-Zionism as antisemitism. It cites as an example of antisemitism: “Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.”

That the Jewish people deserve the right of self-determination, after the Holocaust and the persecution throughout Arab lands for centuries, was resolved in 1948. To debate Zionism is precisely the problem facing the Jews today and most especially Israelis who live in an absurd world in which the nature of their birthright is called into question, as every single Israeli is born of Zionism.

How ironic that in this day and age in the United States, where every minority is protected and words matter more than ever, it is somehow acceptable to define oneself as anti-Zionist, even if Jewish. It is offensive, absurd and deeply antisemitic.

As an American Israeli, I cannot stress enough how toxic this concept is to Israelis and how it does nothing to help the cause of peace today.

Judaism’s core strength is its portability, which has allowed it to survive, against punishing odds, for more than 2,500 years. It is tied to faith and peoplehood, not real estate.

That belief doesn’t make me an anti-Zionist, but it does make me a non-Zionist. My faith may have been created on land within the borders of the state of Israel, but it has been shaped by many forces and people around the globe over the years. And my cultural roots as a Jew lie in Eastern Europe, where all my great-grandparents were born.

Charles Blow mentions that Amnesty International calls Israel’s government an “apartheid regime.” Under South African apartheid, Black people were not citizens of South Africa and, as such, could not vote in elections or serve in its Parliament, could not be treated in hospitals that were reserved for white people, and could not attend the same schools and universities as white people. These are just a few of the indignities suffered by Black people in apartheid South Africa.

None of these harsh discriminatory practices apply to Palestinian Arabs in Israel, where Palestinians make up about 20 percent of Israel’s citizens. They can vote in the country’s elections and have representatives they have elected to the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, can attend Israel’s fine universities, and can work in or be treated in Israel’s hospitals.

Mr. Blow owes it to his readers to correct Amnesty International’s false labeling of Israel as an apartheid state instead of spreading its calumny.

Re “Universities Are Failing at Inclusion,” by David Brooks (column, Nov. 17):

While most of Mr. Brooks’s piece feels true and insightful, especially in the way “ideological war zones” hinder true curiosity, learning and student safety, I feel that he has forgotten the possibility of “both/and.”

As a dean of student life for a New Jersey independent school, I openly identify as an educator committed to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging work, and I long for the ideal of a pluralistic society where all are celebrated for their various life experiences, identities and perspectives.

On the other hand, I do not believe that real societal growth toward pluralism is possible without recognizing and grappling with the long history of “oppressors and oppressed.”

It is not educators teaching about oppression who create the divisiveness; it is those who hold the most power in any society who create the divisions. Literal gated communities and figurative glass ceilings exist to highlight this divisiveness in bluntly metaphorical fashion.

And while we do live in a country where people with a multitude of identities have made the economic climb to “gated” status, that has often included the cost of fully assimilating to the presiding white suburban cultural norms and mores.

True pluralism would mean everyone having equal opportunities to contribute and strive within our society and economy while retaining and showcasing their full selves. And too many Americans do hold the key identity of being oppressed.

Re “A Trump-Biden Rematch Is the Election We Need,” by Carlos Lozada (column, Nov. 12):

When I first saw the headline on Mr. Lozada’s column, I thought, “No way!” After reading the piece and thinking about it, I have decided that this is the one election we truly need to have.

There is no greater comparison than Biden vs. Trump. It is the classic confrontation of good versus evil, and the American people need to decide whether we choose to maintain a constitutional republic, or support an authoritarian, belligerent, vindictive form of government.

The twice impeached, quadruple indicted former president is a clear and present danger, while Joe Biden is a staunch defender of democracy, fairness and decency. We need this election to once and for all defeat MAGA and Trumpism, and send Donald Trump packing, if he is not in prison.

There is no greater threat to the American way of life than Donald Trump, and even if Joe Biden is simply a place holder for the president who is elected in 2028, that would be far more palatable than a Trump presidency.

Henry A. Lowenstein

To the Editor:

Carlos Lozada argues that “we have no choice but to choose” between Donald Trump and President Biden and their dueling visions for America at the ballot box in 2024. This is, for now, a false choice.

In light of the alarming polling trend regarding Mr. Biden’s re-electability, the wisest course of action for the Democrats is to urgently organize, with Mr. Biden’s blessing (he would have to be persuaded), a robust Democratic presidential primary in order to discover whom Democratic voters would turn out for in the largest numbers on Election Day.

But the longer that Democratic elites delay, the Trump-Biden choice will, in short order, become one that we indeed cannot escape. If this occurs, as seems likely, it will be a choice that Mr. Biden and the Democratic establishment impose on the electorate.

And if Mr. Biden comes up short at the ballot box in 2024, as the recent New York Times/Siena poll suggests he will, he and the Democratic Party’s other so-called leaders will have nobody but themselves to blame.

Nicholas Buxton

To the Editor:

Carlos Lozada writes: “Joe Biden versus Donald Trump is not the choice America wants. But it is the choice we need to face.”

Yes, it is the choice we need to face, but what a risk!

With Mr. Trump’s high polling numbers, it certainly seems that a significant number of people support his candidacy unequivocally. What he says and does — illegal or not — makes no difference. He evokes deep emotions and the feeling that he will settle their scores and protect them from the “woke” mob. They like Mr. Trump’s moxie and flouting of authority, but don’t listen to his actual plan of governance.

He plainly wants to create an authoritarian government — put his cronies in the Justice Department and jail his political “enemies,” pack the courts and rule as his whims dictate.

Yes, the best way to end Mr. Trump’s reign of influence would be to decisively defeat him in this election. But we are taking the huge risk that he could win — and end our democracy as we know it.

I would rather risk losing to a Nikki Haley than take the chance on beating Mr. Trump. Unfortunately, we may not have a choice.

It is the job of the Democratic candidates and the media to clearly present the facts about the likely choices in this election. And keep our fingers crossed!

Re “How Are Students Expected to Live Like This on Campuses?,” by Jesse Wegman (Opinion, nytimes.com, Nov. 8):

Mr. Wegman is correct that universities cannot live up to their ideals as havens for unfettered debate when their Jewish students feel physically threatened. And he rightly suggests necessary limits on a culture of free speech, including prohibitions on harassment and targeting based on ethnic or religious identity.

But it is time for a broader interrogation of the vaunted Chicago Principles he cites, which hold that the only appropriate role for a university is to stay silent on matters of public controversy so that its constituents may fully debate it.

I believe that a more important principle for a university — arguably its fundamental principle — is to seek and articulate truth. And in this case, the truth is clear: Hamas is a terrorist organization, dedicated to the destruction of the state of Israel, that is not representative of the Palestinian people as a whole.

To the extent the Chicago Principles prevent universities from stating that truth, they make honest debate more difficult, stain all pro-Palestinian students with the repugnant reputation of Hamas, and undermine university administrators’ ability to isolate and combat real antisemitism on campuses.

There is no doubt that free expression is a paramount value in universities. But we can aspire higher. We can build our bastions of free speech on the foundational layers of moral clarity and intellectual integrity.

Re “What Is Happening on College Campuses Is Not Free Speech,” by Gabriel Diamond, Talia Dror and Jillian Lederman (Opinion guest essay, Nov. 11):

Protecting free speech on campus requires bravery and intellectual honesty, not partisan definitions. As Jewish students, we share in the real fear surrounding the rise of violent threats against our communities. Yet, this fear cannot be addressed with definitions that marginalize legitimate Palestinian advocacy.

The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism that the authors cite, which refers to “rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism,” is opposed even by several progressive, pro-Israel and Jewish organizations. Such critiques correctly cite the definition’s potential to “suppress legitimate free speech, criticism of Israeli government actions, and advocacy for Palestinian rights.”

Institutions of higher education should, of course, address antisemitism; yet, adopting this broad definition would come at the expense of students’ and professors’ fundamental rights to free expression. Regardless of how uncomfortable certain phrases may make us, disagreements surrounding terminology and definitions must not be equated with the very real dangers of death threats, hate speech and physical violence.

Upholding free speech requires empathy and consistency, and we must understand that intimidation and fear on campuses are real, and they are not felt only or even primarily by Jewish students.

There is zero tolerance for racism and zero tolerance for harassment of any kind on today’s campuses, and we should not rest until there is zero tolerance for antisemitism.

For example, she has recommended ending the federal gas tax, enacting a new middle-class tax cut and extending the 2017 Trump administration tax cut. While such policies might attract some voters to Ms. Haley, they would greatly diminish the revenue needed to pay for essential services, not to mention blowing up the national debt.

Re “The Moral Deficiencies of a Liberal Education,” by Ezekiel J. Emanuel (Opinion, Oct. 22):

In my upper-level Georgetown University ethics course, “Ethics of Global Leaders,” a discussion of the conflict between Hamas and Israel devolved into chaotic and accusatory yelling.

There were high emotions, but almost no discussion of practical ethics. Little was learned because students, billed as the world’s future leaders, lacked a moral vocabulary, one strong in substance and cognizant of nuance, to discuss the situation.

Like Dr. Emanuel, I have seen the moral deficiency at the university I attend. It has manifested itself by showing students’ inability to hold civil, nuanced discussions of the moral and geopolitical implications of the Hamas terrorist attacks and the ongoing security operation.

Fixing this will take time, but it starts with instilling a moral vocabulary through embracing disagreement. Students must learn to discuss, not disregard, the opinions of those whom they vehemently disagree with. Likewise, universities must encourage the development of argumentation as a skill to be embraced, not shied away from.

Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel’s critique of academia is consistent with a growing anti-university movement in this country, which casts blame on higher education for everything from political bias to deficient levels of useful skills in the workplace.

But this attack assumes that students come to universities as tabula rasa, without the imprint and influence of parental socialization, years spent in secondary schools, as well as a constant onslaught from all kinds of media, from newspapers to TV to social media, some of which is quite biased itself. It assumes students have no free will and cannot think for themselves.

Faculty and staff of varying political, religious and other perspectives coexist on American campuses. Even within the same major, professors have different perspectives and ways of teaching the same courses. They do not get together in the faculty lounge to conspire to indoctrinate students.

Ezekiel Emanuel’s opinion piece thoughtfully addresses the moral decay at the core of our universities. There are many causes of this tragedy. One of the most significant is the cowardice of administrators, from the top down; they are afraid to alienate donors, professors and students.

The recent vacillating statements from the presidents of Harvard, Stanford, Columbia and many other universities regarding Hamas’s barbaric attack on Israel exemplify this cowardice. But this behavior is not new; rather it has been years in the making.

The rot goes further. Professors are cowed by their students into giving high grades for fear that the students will in turn give their teachers negative evaluations. The professors are afraid they will be expelled from the academy when in fact it is the students who should be penalized for mediocre or poor work. The tail is wagging the dog, and we are all the losers.

This isn’t the first example I’ve seen of hand-wringing “What are they teaching kids these days?” complaints directed at universities, blaming them for intemperate statements made by some of their students. Have Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel and others forgotten their days on campus? My recollection is that poorly thought out screeds were not unusual in undergraduate publications.

I entered M.I.T. as a graduate student in 1978, and during my time there I recall at least four campus newspapers. Among them were a nutty right-wing paper and a nutty left-wing paper. Some of their editorials and even news coverage were sophomoric. Perhaps that was because they were written by, well, sophomores.

I may have thought that the positions taken on both sides were arrogant and naïve, even callous at times, but it never occurred to me that this was somehow a blight on M.I.T. or the university education itself.

Universities could probably do a better job of teaching their students how to formulate and present ideas, and how to make their claims both more influential and less abrasive. But taking academia to task because some in their community say something foolish seems like demanding that our colleges should be enforcers of “cancel culture.” Is this really what we want?

Steve Lowe

Ezekiel Emanuel says his concern is that a coalition of 34 student organizations at Harvard can say that they “hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.” He blames this on their university.

I agree that there is something wrong, but I don’t agree that it is Harvard’s fault. Polling data shows a decline in support for Israel among young people. The favorable/unfavorable ratio of views of Israel among those older than 65 is 69 percent/27 percent, according to the Pew Research Organization. For 18- to 29-year-olds, the ratio is 41 percent/56 percent.

There is a problem, but it is not confined to Ivy League campuses. As the Holocaust and Israel’s existential wars of 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973 fade into the historical rearview mirror, America seems to be losing its emotional connection to Israel.

I do not have a good answer. I think it could help if more Americans visited Israel and developed friendships with Israelis, but I do not know how to make that happen.

In any case, I doubt that tinkering with Harvard College’s curriculum is the answer.

To the Editor:

Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel has clearly identified a major problem in modern liberal arts education — de-emphasizing “critical thinking skills” and avoiding “challenging our students.” He rightly encourages universities to revisit the issue of what it means to be well educated. Unfortunately, this prescription sits uncomfortably in the modern American university.

The problem is that such challenging dialogue is likely to meet resistance. Some students will be made uncomfortable and be offended, which, of course, is the point of the dialogue. One or more will complain to their dean’s office. The “offending” faculty member will then have a meeting with the dean.

Further actions against the instructor may follow, including dismissal, as in the cases of a former Hamline University professor, Erika López Prater, whose students were offended by the showing of a painting of the Prophet Muhammad even though the professor had provided advance notice, and a former New York University professor, Maitland Jones Jr., whose organic chemistry students complained about their test scores.

Instructors are thus incentivized to avoid introducing thought-provoking, possibly uncomfortable material in the classroom. Liberal arts education has been abandoned.

How have universities devolved into this sorry state? Universities have been transformed from viewing students as a group to be educated and informed to viewing students as consumers of a product. The customer is right; their tuition revenues and future gifts are needed.

Perhaps there is a silver lining to recent disturbing events on campuses. They have exposed the weakness of the “customer model” and will hopefully allow us to revisit the question of “What do we think it means to be well educated?” and to begin a return to the liberal education that Dr. Emanuel envisions and that we all should want, uncomfortable as it would be.

Re “The Five-Day Office Week Is Over,” by Nicholas Bloom (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 22):

Mr. Bloom writes that Americans work about one-third of their workdays at home and that remote work has become normal. He names benefits: savings of time and money spent getting to work and flexibility for parents.

But this is true only for a fraction of Americans; many essential kinds of work cannot be done remotely as effectively or at all. Consider teachers (which I am), health care providers, people who work in service jobs and many others.

Economic and status hierarchies that pervade our society are widened by the sharp divide between those who can do their work remotely and those who cannot. I wonder also about the continued erosion of the social fabric as people interact less across differences and spend more time in their own environments.

As helpful as Zoom is, it is no substitute for being in spaces with others across the day. Even when interacting with others in person is challenging, without it we are likely to become more and more isolated and sealed in narrower circles of relationships and communication.

When we look around at what is happening in this country and around the world, is this really a good direction to be heading?

To the Editor:

Nicholas Bloom gushes that the work-from-home revolution is “profoundly positive for the majority of America’s businesses and workers’’ and that “remote work has been good for almost everyone involved.”

But he ignores the greatest losers in this game of empty office chairs: the commercial property owners and their lenders who are sitting with partly empty buildings in almost all major U.S. cities.

More and more office users are reducing their office space requirements, new leasing has slowed to a crawl, and even when leases are consummated they come with large landlord concessions that drive down the net effective value of the leases.

When combined with rising interest rates, tightened lender requirements and dropping cash flow, the reduced office occupancy is pushing commercial real estate to the wall. If this leads to a spate of loan defaults and owners handing over the keys to lenders we will see a number of banks and other real estate lenders in grave economic danger, which will have a significant effect on the wider economy.

When seen from the perspective of commercial real estate owners and lenders, work-from-home is hardly the “win-win-win” that Mr. Bloom so blithely extols. Like the bank defaults of times past, this could turn into a losing proposition for all of us.

Re “Give the Gift of Your Attention,” by David Brooks (column, Oct. 22):

What Mr. Brooks is talking about in his wonderful essay reminds me of the Korean idea of “inshim,” a term similar to the ancient Chinese concept of “ren,” which is best rendered in English as “human heartedness.”

The people in the Korean village where I did fieldwork 50 years ago often spoke admiringly of those who had “good inshim,” meaning people who lived their lives unselfishly, showing consideration for others, doing “the right thing” even if they didn’t always succeed.

Another word that comes to mind in this connection is the Yiddish term “mensch,” which the sportswriter Joe Posnanski describes as a guy who “knows your kids’ names (bonus mensch points for knowing the dog’s name too), offers to take a photo when seeing people struggling with their group selfie and always remembers to pass along the promised book or recipe or recommendation.”

Or, to give a more concrete example from today’s world, the guy who currently sits in the Oval Office is a mensch, and the guy who occupied that seat just before him is not a mensch.

To the Editor:

Kudos to David Brooks’s extraordinary lesson on being human. The only missing element was the power of humor, particularly when it is directed at oneself.

Burdened by a debilitating stutter in my youth, I learned to laugh at it and myself. I found that self-deprecating jokes disarmed those inclined to ridicule me and invited in the compassionate.

In time, I found out that humor was the cure. The more I laughed at myself the less I stuttered. This propelled me to a 40-year career as the headmaster of the Concord Academy and president of the Baltimore Community Foundation, responsibilities that demanded frequent oral communication.

Armed with Mr. Brooks’s advice, I will try to devote my remaining years to listening, and speaking, with a human ear.

To the Editor:

David Brooks’s essay resonated with me at a personal level. In our contemporary age of multitasking with cellphone technology, we have lost the art of paying attention, or even acknowledging the presence of others.

I am by nature a reserved and introverted soul. However, I very much do not want to be seen as aloof by those I encounter. To preclude such an impression, several years ago I developed a habit, initially somewhat forced and awkward. Upon passing someone on my daily run in the park, I would simply flick my hand, pointing to my new acquaintance with an index and forefinger greeting.

Having logged hundreds of miles since introducing my nonverbal icebreaker, I feel a camaraderie with an assortment of individuals with whom I have never spoken. Predictably, there are others who fail to make eye contact, but over time most reciprocate with a smile, wave of the hand, or “Good morning.”

I can truthfully testify that I have been blessed by the outpouring of warmth received in response to such a small gesture of recognition.

Re “18 More Deaths From Our Gun Addiction,” by Stephen King (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 31):

Mr. King’s frustration with gun violence and his feeling of helplessness for our country are not unique, but they are born more from exhaustion than reality.

I reject his view that “there is no solution to the gun problem.” We may be “addicted to firearms,” but America has overcome addiction before with the same grit and persistence that helped end slavery and bend our collective views away from racism.

Cultural change takes generations. The gun culture we mistakenly fell in love with was bolstered by decades of green plastic Army men and Nerf and cap guns handed to preschoolers for play, classroom history lessons centered around military battles, and movie and television hailing the best gun handler as the hero. That was my reality, and I passed that culture to my children.

“The gun problem” is just that: a problem to be solved. Just as we created that problem, we can change it. Every shooting reminds us collectively that firearms violence has become the No. 1 killer of children and teens under the age of 19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Shooting drills are a ubiquitous part of the lives of most schoolchildren.

A good coach knows when to substitute for exhausted players, and it’s OK that Mr. King and others need some bench time. Substituting in are parents afraid to send their kids to school, energized politicians, influencers, researchers and business owners looking over their shoulders for a catastrophic event. I am surrounded by them and their contagious attitudes.

Mr. King may find “little more to write” right now, and that’s OK. The fresh legs off the bench are many, and they are moving with optimism, impatience and persistence to find the right courses of action that will make America’s gun violence problem no longer exist.

I’m sure of that.

The White House spokesman said that a second corridor would be opened and that the daily pauses would be institutionalized to include advance notice of at least three hours.

“I’ve asked for a pause longer than three days,” Biden said. But he has not joined the calls by some in his party and around the world for a full cease-fire, reasoning that Israel has a legitimate interest in destroying Hamas after its Oct. 7 terrorist attack killed more than 1,400 people."

The truce has occasionally been in doubt since it began last Friday, with delicate daily negotiations over the lists of released people on both sides. On Tuesday, each side accused the other of violating the cease-fire but stopped short of pulling out of the agreement, which originally called for Hamas to release 50 Israeli hostages in exchange for 150 Palestinians held by Israel.

On Tuesday, the first day of a two-day extension of the cease-fire, Hamas released more hostages, raising the total to at least 85, according to a New York Times tally. Israel has released 180 Palestinians from its prisons.

Diplomats and intelligence officials were working to negotiate a longer pause. On Tuesday, the top intelligence officials from Egypt, Israel and the United States met with the prime minister of Qatar, the chief mediator between Hamas and Israel. Two people with knowledge of the talks said the hope was that the current model would generate momentum that would prevent the resumption of hostilities and would create the conditions for longer-term talks.

Israel has said that Hamas and other militant groups killed about 1,200 people on Oct. 7 and kidnapped about 240 civilians, both adults and children, and soldiers. Israel has responded with air and land assaults that have killed more than 13,000 people, possibly thousands more, according to the Gazan health authorities.

For weeks, the United States and its allies have been worried that Iran, Hamas’s chief supporter, would push the regional militias it supports in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria, to join the war. The success of the cease-fire has temporarily cooled those concerns, and Group of Seven nations, the wealthiest in the world, have ratcheted up pressure on Israel to protect civilians and increase aid, while demanding Hamas release more hostages.

But there are questions around how long the truce can last. It’s unclear whether Hamas has access to all of the hostages or is even aware where the remainder are, John Kirby, a White House spokesman, said on Tuesday.

Hamas denies that claim, but Israel is adamant that is where Hamas’s leadership is hiding.

Doing so would see fierce fighting inside a location that is supposed to be off limits during a war. And we could be about to witness some very troubling scenes of violence inside places that are supposed to be sanctuaries.

What’s Israel’s endgame in Gaza?

Israel’s plan is still quite vague. They’ve said they want to disband Hamas’s political leadership and military capabilities. They’ve also said that they will retain security control of Gaza “indefinitely.” But it isn’t clear how long they plan to take to do that, or how much time the U.S. government will give them to do that before they start to withdraw their support. It’s also not clear how much time Israel has to do that before there starts to be regional repercussions — like the entry of Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia, into the war — that will force them to rethink their strategy in Gaza.

What will Israel do if and when it takes over the Gaza Strip?

That also isn’t clear. There are calls within Israel to reoccupy it permanently and establish Israeli settlements there, just as there were before 2005 when Israel withdrew from the enclave. There are suggestions that the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the occupied West Bank, might take over in Gaza.

Educators, they write, can “state hard truths and clarify critical issues,” challenge students’ preconceptions and encourage them to “think through their positions using data, evidence and logic.” Teachers can also invite learners “to reflect on how their own emotions shape, and occasionally distort, their analysis of the world around them.”

Soldiers were conducting searches and interrogations inside, and Israeli officers said they had found rifles, ammunition, body armor and other military equipment in a radiology building.

In a video filmed at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, a military spokesman, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, showed about 10 guns, ammunition, protective vests and Hamas military uniforms, some of which he said were hidden behind M.R.I. machines, others in nearby storage units and some behind what he described as a “blast-proof door.” The assertions made in the video could not be independently verified.

Hamas, which has repeatedly denied using the hospital for military operations, issued a statement calling the Israeli claims “a fabricated story that no one would believe.” A Hamas official, Bassem Naim, speaking to Al Jazeera, dismissed the video as falsified “theatrics.”

Al-Shifa Hospital has become central to Israel’s 40-day effort to wrest control of Gaza from Hamas, and its capture by Israel was a significant step that could shape the pace and extent of its war with Hamas. Israel maintains that Hamas built a military command center at the hospital, using its patients and staff as human shields.

The seizure of Al-Shifa, along with whatever evidence the Israelis produce of Hamas’s military presence there, could affect international sentiment about the invasion as well as the continuing negotiations to free the hostages captured by Hamas last month. Gazan authorities said Wednesday that the Israelis were in control of the complex.

Israeli soldiers briefly exchanged fire with gunmen outside the hospital before going in, a senior military official said, but more than 12 hours after it began, the operation appeared more like a police raid than a pitched battle.

One senior Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing operation, said that troops were interrogating people inside the hospital and had found weapons, but declined to provide evidence or further details.

A Palestinian man inside a surgery building at the hospital complex said word had spread among the people there of interrogations and searches, including excavations, and that a tight cordon of Israeli armored vehicles had closed around the hospital.

Little information was available on Wednesday afternoon, as communications were disrupted in Gaza City.

Palestinian officials, the heads of United Nations agencies and some Mideast regional leaders condemned the raid, warning that it risked the lives of Gaza’s most vulnerable.

For years, Israel has said that Hamas built a military command center beneath the hospital, turning its patients into human shields.

To Palestinians, Al-Shifa Hospital is a civilian institution that for weeks has served as a refuge for thousands of displaced Gazans in addition to the gravely ill and wounded. Hamas and the hospital’s leadership deny its use as a military base.

The Israeli military invaded Gaza last month after roughly 1,200 people were killed in Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7. Since then, Israeli airstrikes have killed more than 11,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gazan health officials — one of the largest tolls in any air campaign this century.

The Hamas-run government media office in Gaza said in a statement that the Israeli soldiers had beaten patients and displaced people sheltering at the hospital and had expelled others from the complex.

Muhammad Zaqout, a senior health Gazan official, said in a news briefing that the Israeli soldiers had first entered part of a surgery department before later taking control of the radiology and cardiology departments.

Because of the communications disruption, The New York Times could not reach hospital administrators. The Palestinian man interviewed by telephone in the surgery building at the hospital said he had not heard of anyone being beaten.

“De facto, today, civilians are bombed — de facto,” he told the BBC in an interview. “These babies, these ladies, these old people are bombed and killed. So there is no reason for that and no legitimacy. So we do urge Israel to stop.”

France, like much of the Western world, considers Hamas a terrorist organization, and Mr. Macron stressed that his country had experienced terrorism and condemned Hamas’s devastating Oct. 7 attack on Israel. But he said there was “no justification” for bombing civilians who were not tied to Hamas.

The remarks came a day after a humanitarian aid conference in Paris focused on the war in Gaza. In the BBC interview, Mr. Macron said the conference had produced a consensus among aid agencies and governments that a humanitarian pause followed by a cease-fire was needed to protect civilians.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said that a cease-fire would be contingent on the release of hostages. Israel says that 239 people abducted from Israel on Oct. 7 are still being held.

On Friday night, Mr. Netanyahu fired back at Mr. Macron, issuing a statement around midnight in Israel in which he blamed Hamas for any harm suffered by civilians in Gaza and called on world leaders to condemn the group.

“While Israel does everything to avoid harming civilians and calls on them to leave the combat zones — Hamas-ISIS does everything to prevent them from leaving safe areas and uses them as a human shield,” Mr. Netanyahu said, repeating a parallel he has sought to draw before between Hamas and the Islamic State, which has conducted and inspired terrorist attacks around the world.

Mr. Netanyahu warned that the crimes Hamas “is committing today in Gaza will be committed tomorrow in Paris, New York and anywhere in the world.”

Just weeks ago, Mr. Macron and Mr. Netanyahu were meeting in Tel Aviv during a visit that the French president said was intended to convey his country’s “solidarity” with Israel in its time of mourning.

But international support for Israel in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack has eroded as images come out daily of the destruction and death in Gaza from Israel's military campaign. Mr. Macron, along with leaders elsewhere in Europe as well as the United States, is increasingly questioning Israel’s military response and calling for a cease-fire to save civilian lives."

The exchange followed an hourslong delay that raised fears the fragile deal could collapse.

The exchange was the latest step in an agreement that allows for a pause in fighting to be extended. Israel has said it is prepared to grant another day’s pause for every 10 hostages that Hamas releases beyond the 50 outlined in the agreement. Hamas has not responded to the offer.

At least 128 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli security forces or civilians in the West Bank since Oct. 7, according to the United Nations.

On Thursday, an Israeli settler was killed when Palestinians opened fire on his car as he drove home from military duty, according to the Israeli military and medics. The local settler regional council identified the victim as Elhanan Klein, 29, a father of three and reservist.

No Palestinian armed group immediately claimed responsibility for the shooting.

At least three Palestinians were killed in Israeli military raids across the West Bank overnight, including a 14-year-old, the Palestinian Authority Health Ministry said on Thursday. Another 14-year-old died from wounds sustained earlier this week, the ministry reported.

The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the deaths. Israeli troops have conducted nightly raids across the occupied territory to arrest Palestinians, many of them accused of Hamas membership, and have engaged in gun battles with militants.

Such confrontations have long roiled the West Bank, but the violence has intensified over the last three weeks, more than doubling to seven incidents a day, on average, compared with three incidents a day since the start of 2023, according to U.N. statistics.

An increasing number of Israeli communities have taken root in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967.

For Israel’s leaders in particular, the pause has created a strategic dilemma. They have big reasons to extend it again — and big reasons to resume fighting.

On the one hand, many international groups and other countries support a cease-fire, pointing to the brutal death toll among Gazan civilians since Oct. 7. President Biden has also pushed for the pause to continue so long as Hamas is releasing hostages. Within Israel, families of the hostages have called on their country’s leaders to prioritize the release of all hostages.

On the other hand, the pause offers advantages to Hamas. Its leaders can move to new hiding places. Its militants can fortify their positions in southern Gaza before future fighting.

Patrick Kingsley, The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, who covers Israel and the occupied territories, explains what may lie ahead.

If Israel continues as planned, the next few weeks could be the bloodiest of the war so far. Already, roughly 1,400 Israelis and over 10,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health authorities in Gaza.

That death toll could rise once Israel starts fighting in earnest within the urban warren that is Gaza City, which is Hamas’s stronghold and the primary target of Israel’s invasion. Once Israeli forces enter en masse, we will see very intense urban warfare, in part because this is Hamas’s home turf. It’s where they’ve built and dug hundreds of miles of subterranean tunnels from which they can emerge and launch ambushes that will stymie the Israeli army’s progress."

White House officials said that when the secretary of state, Antony J.

President Biden is facing deep anger over his solidarity with Israel among his supporters and even from some staff members, particularly those with Arab or Muslim backgrounds, who have said they feel disenchanted with the president. And for many in the Arab community, his words and actions after the Oct. 7 attacks have left them feeling like an afterthought in the war between Israel and Hamas.

Biden administration officials say the president’s support for Israel’s right to defend itself after Hamas’s deadly assault is only part of the story, and that Biden’s stance has allowed him to wield influence with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on issues like humanitarian aid and to make more forceful calls for the protection of Palestinian civilians.

Biden has long been a champion of Israel and of Jewish nationalism, saying often that “you don’t have to be a Jew to be a Zionist.” His unwavering support has at times put him at odds with some other Democrats, particularly among a left-leaning coalition that sees the Palestinian cause as an extension of racial and social justice movements.

Israel raids Al-Shifa for a second day

Two days into its search of the Al-Shifa Hospital complex in Gaza, the Israeli military offered video of weapons it said it had found there and what it described as a tunnel entrance. The images could not be independently verified and have not proved the existence of the sprawling Hamas base that the Israeli military said the hospital had concealed, and which Hamas and the hospital leadership have denied.

Since invading Gaza 20 days ago, Israel has presented Al-Shifa as a primary target, saying it sits atop a network of subterranean fortifications installed by Hamas. That claim has been central to Israel’s justification for the death toll in Gaza caused by its military campaign, which has killed more than 11,000 people, according to Gazan health officials.

The ability of Israel to prove its claim could determine whether its foreign allies continue to support the country’s military response to Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel. White House officials have said they believe, based on intelligence gathered independently of Israeli sources, that Hamas has used the hospital as a base.

What is the goal of COP28?

Look for three significant results from this summit.

The first is what’s called the global stocktake. This is the first formal assessment of whether nations are on track to meet a goal they set in Paris in 2015 to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.

That’s the threshold beyond which scientists say it will be increasingly hard for humans to cope with the severe storms, drought, heat and sea level rise that will intensify as the planet continues to heat up. Spoiler alert: The planet has already warmed by 1.2 degrees Celsius and emissions that are driving the change are going up, not down. The review will lay the groundwork for ambitious actions countries must take going forward, activists hope.

Second, there is an expectation that nations will finalize the so-called “loss and damage” fund they agreed to create last year. The major questions to be resolved include who will pay into the fund and who will have access to the money.

Finally, there is the political agreement that could emerge from the summit. It is likely that nations could agree on a deal to replace polluting fossil fuels with clean energy such as wind and solar power. The question is whether nations agree to phase out fossil fuels and, if so, what caveats are attached."

The cease-fire was the longest break in fighting in Gaza since Oct. 7, when gunmen from Hamas and other militant groups launched a deadly attack on southern Israel.

Israel has said that it is prepared to grant another day’s pause for every 10 hostages Hamas releases beyond the 50 outlined in the agreement. The country said in that agreement that it would release 150 Palestinian women and children.

Promises: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel visited his country’s troops in the Gaza Strip. “We are continuing until the end — until victory,” he vowed, adding, “Nothing will stop us.”"

The cease-fire deal calls for Hamas to return 50 women and children in phases over four days, while Israel would release 150 imprisoned or detained Palestinian women and teenagers.

At a news conference on Friday, President Biden said he did not know when American hostages would be released, but that officials “expect it to occur.” He added that he did not know the conditions of the 10 Americans who are unaccounted for, and he did not say how many he expected would be freed over the next three scheduled days of releases.

President Biden called the Friday releases “the start of a process.”

The hostages that were initially released by Hamas included 13 Israelis, all women and children, 10 Thai citizens and one Filipino, according to government officials.

In addition to killing about 1,200 people in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, the militants took about 240 hostages back to Gaza. Hamas had previously released four of the hostages, including a mother and a daughter with dual American citizenship, on Oct. 20.

Their assertions could not be independently verified, and Hamas said they were “fabricated.” Here’s the latest.

Palestinian officials, the heads of U.N. agencies and some Mideast regional leaders condemned the raid, warning that it risked the lives of Gaza’s most vulnerable, including the gravely ill and wounded.

Hundreds of ill and wounded patients and displaced people have been trapped inside the hospital, the largest in the enclave. Intense close-quarters combat is taking place nearby between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters. In recent days, Israeli tanks and troops have drawn close to the facility, one of the few health centers still functioning in northern Gaza.

Many staff members have fled Al-Shifa. Without fuel to run generators, the hospital has been plunged into darkness, forcing remaining staff to tend to patients by the light of their cellphones, an official said. The hospital was out of oxygen and dialysis had stopped, he added.

Saudi Arabia had initially scheduled two summits over this weekend, one for members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the second for the Arab League. But they were combined into one event on Saturday. Representatives from Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq were also expected to attend.

The leaders, who worry that the unrest will spill across the region, are expected to call for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and the provision of more desperately needed humanitarian aid, as well as a restart to peace talks for a lasting solution.

The war was set off by an Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that controls Gaza, which killed roughly 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. Israel has since bombarded Gaza with thousands of airstrikes, laid siege to the territory by cutting off water, food, fuel and other basic necessities, and launched a ground invasion. The war has killed more than 10,000 Palestinians, many of them children and women, according to the Gaza health ministry.

Mr. Raisi’s trip follows a significant pivot in March, when Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed to reopen embassies in each other’s countries and to revive a security pact in a deal brokered by China.

The rivalry for dominance between the two Middle Eastern powers has long shaped regional politics and trade. It has predominantly played out via proxy conflicts in Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon, where Iran has supported militias that Saudi officials say have destabilized the region.

587,587,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/world/europe/ioc-fake-news.html,"The International Olympic Committee issued an unusual statement on Thursday saying it had been targeted by “fake news posts” that it said contained “defamatory content, a fake narrative and false information.” The elaborate campaign included manufactured quotations from I.O.C. representatives, fake news stories citing those fabricated comments and even a Netflix-style documentary series released online and narrated by a voice purporting to be the actor Tom Cruise.

The I.O.C. said it had been aware for months of the four-part documentary series, titled “Olympics Has Fallen,” and had succeeded in having it removed from a channel on YouTube, the world’s largest video streaming service. The film remains visible on other platforms, however, including the encrypted messaging and content platform Telegram.

It was a separate post on Telegram that appears to have prompted the Olympic committee to issue its statement on Thursday. That post, which contained another well-produced video with overlaying text, carried the logo of Canal Plus, France’s biggest premium television network. It purported to quote the Olympic committee’s top spokesman suggesting the I.O.C. was weighing whether to ban the teams representing Israel and Palestine from next summer’s Summer Olympics in Paris.

The news report appeared on the Telegram channel on Oct. 18 and remains viewable there. The I.O.C. only learned of it last week, when a German-language news agency asked it to confirm the content was accurate.

“This is not the first time the I.O.C. has been faced with disinformation campaigns being run against the organization on social media,” the Olympic committee said in its statement, adding, “All this appears to be part of an organized disinformation campaign.”

The I.O.C. did not specify who it suspected of being behind the videos and the Telegram channel.

The channel has more than 400,000 subscribers and is almost entirely full of Russian-language content. The I.O.C. recently announced it had suspended Russia’s national Olympic Committee, and it is weighing how to allow Russian athletes to compete at the Paris Olympics amid continued opposition from dozens of nations demanding a complete prohibition on Russian participation because of the country’s invasion of Ukraine.

The I.O.C.’s response to being targeted comes as Russia claims that it is being unfairly treated and singled out for harsh penalties related to the ongoing war in Ukraine, while nations involved in other conflicts — including Israel — have not faced similar punishments.

Disinformation has become a potent force in the online age, capable of stoking anger, sowing confusion and spreading false narratives in an instant. It can influence elections, popular opinion and even economic markets, and has been a feature employed by both sides in the war in Ukraine and in the current conflict in Gaza, where Iran, Russia and, to a lesser degree, China have used state media, social networking platforms and online allies to support Hamas and undercut Israel.

Concerned by the growing power and effectiveness of disinformation campaigns, a center at the State Department now seeks to identify and expose them before they can gain traction, a reflection of the growing belief that false narratives are harder to counter once they have begun to spread.

The news video about the I.O.C. on Telegram runs more than 90 seconds. It carries quotes purporting to be from the Olympic committee’s top spokesman, Mark Adams, saying delegates at the committee’s annual meeting, held recently in India, came close to suspending representatives of the Israeli and Palestinian national teams as well as their fans.

Text accompanying the fake news report said the I.O.C. was considering suspending the two delegations as well because “the Olympic Committee fears a repeat of the 1972 terrorist attack in Munich.”

The news clip ends with a promo for the documentary series and a scannable code that links to it.

Those films attack the I.O.C. as an institution and its leadership, particularly its president, Thomas Bach, and a group it describes as his “flunkies.” Mr. Bach and others in his circle, it says without evidence, are at the center of a plot to “cleverly embezzle funds from the entire sports community by way of cunning fraudulent schemes.”

Wary of further attempts to undermine it, the I.O.C. included links to its website and all of its official social media channels in its statement on Thursday, and requested that news media members contact it to confirm the authenticity of information circulating about the organization on social media."

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has rejected calls for even a temporary cease-fire until hostages are released by Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that, in a brazen attack on Oct. 7, took about 240 captives and killed roughly 1,400 people, according to the Israeli authorities.

Israeli officials insist that their military campaign must destroy Hamas, which rules Gaza and is estimated to have tens of thousands of fighters inside the territory.

The national conversation about gun violence focuses on big federal policy ideas. Activists and pundits often speak about the need for a federal law enacting universal background checks or banning assault weapons. Anything short of action at the national level will fail to make the U.S. as safe as Canada, Europe or Japan, the argument goes.

It’s true that guns kill many more people in the U.S. than in other rich countries, and America will likely remain an outlier for the foreseeable future. But the study by Sharkey and Kang shows that changes at the state level can have an effect. Even policies that seem limited, like safety-training requirements or age restrictions, add up.

“There’s no single policy that is going to eliminate the flow or circulation of guns within and across states,” Sharkey said. “But the idea is these kinds of regulations accumulate.”

After all, America’s gun problem is rooted in easy access to firearms. In every country, people get into arguments, hold racist views or suffer from mental health issues. But when these problems turn violent, quick access to guns makes that violence much more likely to become lethal.

Anything that adds barriers to picking up a firearm in such moments reduces deaths, whether it’s incremental state policies or broader federal laws. The new study is one part of a broader line of research demonstrating that point."

And when they have passed laws to deal with the problem in the past decade, those policies have centered on opioids. They have, for example, focused on boosting access to medications that treat only opioid addiction or reverse only opioid overdoses.

That narrow focus has neglected the rise of other drugs, as my colleague Jan Hoffman reports today. In the last five years, overdose deaths involving methamphetamine have tripled. Those linked to cocaine have doubled. People addicted to opioids increasingly use other substances, including meth, cocaine and prescription medications like Valium and Xanax.

Meth use, in particular, has also made it difficult to stabilize patients and keep them in treatment for any drug, as one addiction doctor explained to Jan:

The paranoia and hallucinations caused by meth disorient them, he said. One patient threw himself in a river to escape nonexistent people who were chasing him. Others insisted that dumpsters were talking to them, that color-coded cars were sending them messages.

These types of problems are why experts have long urged policymakers to take a comprehensive approach to drug addiction. More support for opioid addiction medications is important, but so is funding underused treatments that address meth and cocaine addiction (such as paying people to stop using drugs)."

Disputes over how much funding to cut and which conservative policy provisions to attach have left Mr. Johnson and his leadership team facing a significant challenge in securing passage of the remaining measures.

House Democrats uniformly oppose all of the bills because right-wing Republicans have demanded that the funding levels be set below a debt and spending agreement struck this year between Kevin McCarthy, the speaker at the time, and Mr. Biden.

In many other countries, female labor-force participation has propelled economic growth. But India has one of the world’s lowest rates of formal employment for women. The percentage of women doing paid work has dropped sharply in recent years. Last year, 24 percent had a paid job, down from 29 percent in 2010. In China, by comparison, that rate is about 60 percent.

“Every month, I read a statistic somewhere about how our G.D.P. is losing out because we don’t have ‘productive workers’ in the work force, and by that they mean women,” said Shrayana Bhattacharya, an economist at the World Bank.

But changing that is easier said than done.

Risk vs. reward

One problem is India’s “jobless growth”: Although the country has some big companies, especially in technology, they are clustered in a few large cities. Much of the country’s recent economic growth has been concentrated in small, family-owned firms that employ few outsiders."
616,616,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/briefing/shoplifting-data.html,"Is the U.S. in the middle of a shoplifting wave? Target and other retail chains have warned of widespread theft. News outlets have amplified the story. On social media, people have posted videos of thieves looting stores.

But the increase in shoplifting appears to be limited to a few cities, rather than being truly national. In most of the country, retail theft has been lower this year than it was a few years ago, according to police data. There are some exceptions, particularly New York City, where shoplifting has spiked. But outside New York, shoplifting incidents in major cities have fallen 7 percent since 2019, before the Covid pandemic.

Why has the issue nonetheless received so much attention? Today’s newsletter tries to answer that question while taking a deeper look at recent shoplifting trends.

The data

The various sources of crime data — from government agencies and private groups — tell a consistent story. Retail theft has not spiked nationwide in the past several years. If anything, it appears less common in most of the country than it was before the pandemic."
617,617,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/briefing/abortion-access-ohio-vote.html,"On Tuesday, Ohio voters will decide whether to protect access to abortion in their state.

The measure on the ballot, known as Issue 1, would change the state’s Constitution to provide the right for every person to “make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions” before a fetus is viable outside the womb (usually around 23 or 24 weeks of pregnancy). If Issue 1 passes, Ohio will become the latest state to vote to protect or expand abortion access. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, abortion rights have gone six for six in elections, including in red states, when voters have made direct decisions on the issue.

A defeat for Issue 1, on the other hand, may suggest that abortion opponents have figured out a successful counterstrategy. In August, an Ohio elections board, which Republicans control, approved ballot language that differs significantly from the language that would appear in the Constitution if voters approve the measure. Among other changes, the board substituted the phrase “unborn child” for “fetus.”

Opponents of Issue 1 have also recently suggested that the measure isn’t necessary because abortion rights are already protected in Ohio. “You can have an abortion up to and through the fifth month of pregnancy,” the president of Ohio Right to Life, Mike Gonidakis, has said. That is correct for now, but state legislators have passed a six-week abortion ban, and the temporary court order that is blocking it is being appealed to the conservative Ohio Supreme Court.

The problem that Issue 1’s opponents are trying to solve is that most voters — including one-third of Republicans in Ohio — support access to abortion. “The pro-life side had it easy when abortion was legal,” Steven Mitchell, a Republican pollster who says he is pro-life, told me for a story in September for The New York Times Magazine. “But things went crazy when people saw that was taken away.”"

One theme is that Democrats are hoping to continue their strong recent electoral performance despite President Biden’s low approval rating.

Why have Democrats done so well in elections since 2022? In part, it’s because voter turnout is modest in off-year elections like today’s. The people who vote tend to be engaged in politics. They are older, more affluent and more highly educated than people who vote only in presidential elections.

As the Democratic Party becomes more upscale — the class inversion of American politics that this newsletter often discusses — the party will naturally do better in lower-turnout elections than it once did. But these victories do not necessarily foreshadow presidential elections. The other side of the class inversion is that Democrats are increasingly struggling with lower-income and nonwhite voters, many of whom vote only in presidential elections.

Today’s elections still matter for their own sake, of course. Below, we list the questions that can help you make sense of the results."

Mr. Joko, who arrived in Washington fresh from a summit in Saudi Arabia where he condemned the war, has been vocal in criticizing Israel’s role. After Mr. Biden welcomed him to the Oval Office by celebrating a “new era of relations between the United States and Indonesia,” Mr. Joko ended his own set of remarks by calling for an end to the conflict.

“Indonesia also wishes our partnership contributes to regional and global peace and prosperity,” Mr. Joko said. “So Indonesia appeals to the U.S. to do more to stop the atrocities in Gaza. Cease-fire is a must for the sake of humanity.”

Mr. Biden, whose administration had said a cease-fire would only benefit Hamas, did not respond. On Monday, Mr. Biden and other officials called for the protection of hospitals in Gaza from attack."

Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, all seven states to have voted on abortion rights have chosen to protect or expand them.

In Virginia, Democrats flipped the House of Delegates and kept control of the State Senate, albeit narrowly. That will likely doom Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s hopes of passing a 15-week abortion ban. It may also quiet some Republicans’ calls for Youngkin to run for president, given that he had trumpeted his approach to abortion as a sensible middle ground for his party.

Will Shortz: Those are the two biggest changes. But in addition I’ve tried to broaden the range of contributors.

623,623,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/briefing/biden-trump-2024-election.html,"With President Biden having fallen behind Donald Trump in the early 2024 polls, Trump’s strategy seems fairly straightforward: more of the same. Trump will portray Biden as old, inflation as high, immigration as out of control and the nation as weak. All these arguments play into the concerns of many voters.

But what might Biden do to improve his position over the next year? Today’s newsletter looks at four possibilities.

1. The ‘anti-MAGA majority’

Since Trump took office in 2017, the Republican Party has struggled nationally. In 2018, it lost control of the House. In 2020, Trump lost his re-election bid. In the 2022 midterms, Democrats did better than expected.

Michael Podhorzer, a political analyst and a former A.F.L.-C.I.O. official, argues that this pattern stems from the emergence of “an anti-MAGA majority.” Americans under 30, for example, have been voting at higher rates since 2016, partly because of their opposition to Trump, Podhorzer notes. Other analysts have pointed to suburban voters who are turned off by Trump’s attacks on democracy. This pattern helps explain why Trump-endorsed candidates in swing states like Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania did so poorly in the 2022 midterms."
624,624,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/climate/biden-cop28-climate-dubai.html,"President Biden signed the country’s first major climate law and is overseeing record federal investment in clean energy. In each of the past two years, he attended the annual United Nations climate summit, asserting American leadership in the fight against global warming.

But this year, likely to be the hottest in recorded history, Mr. Biden is staying home.

According to a White House official who asked to remain anonymous to discuss the president’s schedule, Mr. Biden will not travel to the summit in Dubai. Aides say he is consumed by other global crises, namely trying to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas in its war with Israel and working to persuade Congress to approve aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia.

At home, Mr. Biden’s climate and energy policies are crashing against competing political pressures. Concerned about Republican attacks that Mr. Biden is pursuing a “radical green agenda,” centrists in his party want him to talk more about the fact that the United States has produced record amounts of crude oil this year. At the same time, climate activists, particularly the young voters who helped elect Mr. Biden, want the president to shut down drilling altogether.

Internationally, developing countries are pushing Mr. Biden to deliver on promises for billions of dollars to help cope with climate change. But Republicans in Congress who control spending scoff at the idea and have been unable to reach agreement among themselves on issues like aid to Israel and Ukraine."
625,625,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/us/politics/elon-musk-antisemitism-white-house.html,"The White House on Friday denounced Elon Musk for boosting an anti-Jewish conspiracy theory on his social media platform X, calling the actions of Mr. Musk, the world’s richest person, an “abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate.”

Mr. Musk endorsed a post on X, formerly Twitter, accusing Jewish people who are facing antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war of pushing the “exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them” and supporting the immigration of “hordes of minorities.”

“You have said the actual truth,” Mr. Musk replied to the post.

Jewish groups have compared the statement in the original post to a belief known as replacement theory, an antisemitic conspiracy theory that nonwhite immigrants, organized by Jews, intend to replace the white race. That idea fueled Robert Bowers, who raged against Jewish people online before killing 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018.

“It is unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust,” Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.

Mr. Bates said President Biden would continue to condemn antisemitism, which has been on the rise since the Oct. 7 attack in which Hamas fighters killed about 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 200. Israel has retaliated with a punishing air campaign and ground invasion into Gaza, which is governed by Hamas.

“We condemn this abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate in the strongest terms, which runs against our core values as Americans,” Mr. Bates said. “We all have a responsibility to bring people together against hate, and an obligation to speak out against anyone who attacks the dignity of their fellow Americans and compromises the safety of our communities.”

X did not respond to requests for comment.

IBM, a major advertiser on X, suspended its advertisement spending after learning the company’s ads were showing up next to white nationalist and Nazi content. Subsequently Mr. Musk endorsed a post on a book about IBM’s involvement in the Holocaust.

Mr. Musk has faced increasing criticism that he has tolerated and even encouraged antisemitic abuse on his social media platform. He has attacked George Soros, the financier who is a frequent target of antisemitic abuse, and threatened to sue the Anti-Defamation League, a rights group that has highlighted the rise in antisemitism on X.

Mr. Musk also has a history of feuds with President Biden, though he said he had voted for Mr. Biden in the 2020 presidential election.

He criticized the Biden administration for not inviting his company Tesla to a White House event in August 2021 on the future of electric cars, later speculating that the exclusion was due to the lack of unionization among workers at its factories.

The following month, Mr. Musk, whose public political views have shifted rightward over the years, went on Twitter to mock Mr. Biden for “sleeping,” echoing an insult for the president popularized by Donald Trump.

Last year, Mr. Biden took a shot at Mr. Musk and his criticism of the U.S. economy during a news conference. “Lots of luck on his trip to the moon,” the president said, poking fun at Mr. Musk’s space endeavors.

Still, the two sides have found common ground on which to work together. Earlier this year, the Biden administration announced that Tesla would allow all electric vehicles — not just its own models — to use 7,500 Tesla charging stations across the United States by the end of 2024.

“In building our EV charging network, we have to ensure that as many chargers work for as many drivers as possible,” Mr. Biden tweeted in February. “To that end, @elonmusk will open a big part of @Tesla’s network up to all drivers.”"

But I continue to think that recent elections offer a more complex picture, and I want to use today’s newsletter to explain. I know that some readers are skeptical.

Widespread abortion access is clearly popular, even in many red states. When Americans have voted directly on the issue since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, abortion rights have gone seven for seven. What’s less clear is how much abortion politics affect general elections between a Democrat and a Republican. Is the effect large — or usually only enough to tip very close races?

But we are committed to doing the hard work to address this scourge.”

Their moves, however, may not quell the anger among donors.

And the actions may only fuel the resolve among pro-Palestinian student activists, who say that they are only speaking up for marginalized, oppressed people living in Gaza.

In addition, many pro-Palestinian students point out that they have faced doxxing and harassment — and they are asking on social media for similar efforts against Islamophobia.

The report called for higher taxes on the rich, a higher minimum wage, more regulation of Wall Street, more support for labor unions, more aggressive antitrust enforcement and more government investment in economic growth. National news outlets covered the report while also noting how much of a break it represented with decades of economic policy by both the Democratic and Republican Parties. There was ample reason to be skeptical that much would change.

But much has changed in the past eight years.

President Biden has enacted the biggest government investment programs in decades, two of which — in infrastructure and semiconductor development — received bipartisan support. Both the Biden and Trump administrations showed more interest in antitrust policy than their predecessors. Many states, blue and red, have increased their minimum wages.

Union members are hopeful that the deal will bring significant financial concessions that made SAG-AFTRA’s longest-ever strike worth it. But the changing economics of Hollywood may temper some gains, echoing the dilemma facing resurgent unions elsewhere in the country.

639,639,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/opinion/does-protest-work-bevins.html,"For a full decade, mobilized by social media and inflamed by the inequities of globalization, the world was on fire with mass protest: Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party, Tahrir Square and the Arab Spring, Gezi Park in Turkey, Brazil and Chile and Ukraine and Hong Kong. At the time it was almost irresistible to overlook the differences among these movements and see instead an astonishing unforeseen rupture in the global order — one that just kept ripping, a modern-day 1848 of parallel global uprising. Yet writing about the decade in retrospect, Bevins argues that what is most remarkable is how it ended: with nearly every country back where it started or worse, as reactionary forces and backlash unbent what once looked like an inevitable arc of history.

What explains the pattern? For Bevins, it is primarily a question of political strategy and structure, how contemporary protest has exchanged purpose for scale and how little trust these recent movements have placed in those traditional forms of radical hierarchy that he calls, in a purposeful provocation, “Leninism.”

Movements need followers, he writes, but they also need leaders. When they choose instead to fetishize shapelessness or what they often call, these days, horizontality, the prospects for real change shrink pretty quickly, and the genuinely revolutionary energy of the streets is left somewhat up for grabs. In some cases, it simply dissipates — mass protest as release valve. In others, it is repurposed by more strategic actors with clearer objectives, often political agents friendlier to the establishment and working to enclose the protest energy in a big centrist tent. In still others, the initial protests present the provocation around which outraged others can mobilize a reactionary backlash.

In Brazil, over the last decade, it was all of the above: Anarchist agitators decided to back away from the raucous energy of the street after they helped unleash it, then watched as the middle class and media reinterpreted the protests as generic calls for reform, leading to corruption investigations that eventually toppled the social-democratic party in power, landed its onetime leader Lula in prison and helped usher in the rabid right-wing government of Jair Bolsonaro.

The pattern holds not just across the poorer parts of the world, where Bevins focuses, but also in more affluent and outwardly stable parts of Europe and North America as well. Here, recent protests have been characterized by the same two distinctive features: their enormous scale and their mercurial shapelessness.

The S.E.C. on trial

The Supreme Court will hear a landmark case this week that could determine the future of the S.E.C.’s in-house enforcement arm and have serious consequences for how other regulators operate.

It all began with an enforcement action against a hedge fund manager. About a decade ago, the S.E.C. charged George Jarkesy, an investment adviser and conservative media personality, with securities fraud. Jarkesy was found guilty in an administrative proceeding overseen by an administrative law judge. But he won a later challenge to that process in federal court, saying that the Seventh Amendment guaranteed the right to a jury trial.

The S.E.C. has challenged that ruling. The agency argues that the right to a jury trial is limited for civil actions and that Congress did not make a mistake in setting up the agency in this way. Defendants, however, contend that these proceedings are weighted in favor of the agencies.

Most justices have shown an inclination to limit agency power and this is just one of several cases challenging the power of federal regulators. The Supreme Court is also mulling the future of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and whether to overrule a principle that requires judges to defer to agencies’ interpretations of administrative rules."

“On behalf of the finalists, we oppose the ongoing bombardment of Gaza and call for a humanitarian cease-fire to address the urgent humanitarian needs of Palestinian civilians, particularly children,” Bilal said. “We oppose antisemitism and anti-Palestinian sentiment and Islamophobia equally, accepting the human dignity of all parties, knowing that further bloodshed does nothing to secure lasting peace in the region. ”

This time around, the hopefuls dialed up the battle for second place and delivered digs at President Biden, but directed only glancing criticism at Mr. Trump. There were also plenty of parries between the candidates. At times, they moved beyond policy and became personal, such as when Nikki Haley called Vivek Ramaswamy “scum” after he referred to her daughter.

President Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, are set to meet tomorrow as the two seek to maintain ties and as business leaders watch for a thaw.

But it’s a sign that Biden and Xi want to continue relations, despite trade tensions, tit-for-tat sanctions and questions about the future of Taiwan. The Dealbook newsletter takes a look at what’s at stake for the meeting.

American officials have been at pains to emphasize that the U.S. and China are competitors rather than zero-sum rivals. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, has called the countries “economically interdependent,” and Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary, has warned that economic separation “would have significant global repercussions.”

Common ground: The U.S. hopes to resume military communications with China that were broken off after Representative Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last year. The U.S. is also seeking cooperation on efforts to stop climate change as well as fentanyl trafficking — China is a major source of the drug."

The measure accused Ms. Tlaib of “antisemitic activity” and referred to the Oct. 18 protest as an “insurrection.”

Twenty-three Republicans broke with their party in voting to kill it.

It was the first in a series of back-to-back disciplinary actions scheduled for action on Wednesday by the House, which is resuming legislative business this week after nearly a month of paralysis and Republican infighting. The measures amounted to a round of partisan blame-laying and institutional strife and featured dueling accusations of antisemitism.

Following the vote on censuring Ms. Tlaib, the House had planned to turn to an effort to formally rebuke Ms. Greene for “racist rhetoric and conspiracy theories,” citing her past antisemitic statements, anti-L.G.B.T.Q.+ remarks and her praise and support for those charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.

In the last election, voters judged him to be more likable than Trump, to have a better temperament and to have a more appealing personality. Those advantages have largely disappeared.

Instead, voters say they are concerned about Biden’s handling of the economy and about his age. More than 70 percent of registered voters in the battlegrounds agree with the statement that Biden is “just too old to be an effective president,” up from around 30 percent in the run-up to the last election.

Biden appears to be especially weak among young, Black and Hispanic voters. In a major departure from recent electoral trends, he and Trump are essentially tied among 18-to-29-year-old voters, even though young voters have tended to back Democrats by a wide margin in recent cycles.

Among Black voters, more than 90 percent of whom usually back Democrats, Biden leads only 71-22. He holds only 50 percent of Hispanic voters across the battlegrounds, down from more than 60 percent in the last cycle.

Stefanos Chen, a colleague who has covered the competition for casino licenses, noted that the commission of Munro’s work was a sign of what developers were willing to do to engender good will — an important factor in winning over local officials and residents who will have a say in the licensing process.

Michael Hershman, the chief executive of the Soloviev Group and a member of the Soloviev Foundation’s advisory board, said the installation would stay up for a year “regardless of whether we’re awarded a license or not.” He also said that if Soloviev were to win a casino license, part of Munro’s exhibit would figure in the landscaping design. “It’ll become a permanent fixture,” Hershman said.

The installation will be an immersive, walk-through experience, like “Bruce Munro: Light at Sensorio,” which open in 2019 in Paso Robles, Calif. Our writer Patricia Leigh Brown called the California exhibit a “mind-bending spectacle” that has become an Instagram phenomenon. “The subtly changing patterns of this light safari, activated by a nebula of fiber-optic cables attached to hidden projectors, seem to inspire a cathedral-like awe,” she wrote.

Hershman said the conversations that led to commissioning Munro for the East Side site began before the pandemic, when Hershman and the sons of the developer Sheldon Solow were considering the future of Solow’s art collection. In the decade before his death in 2020, Solow had become a major seller of masterpieces at auction, but he “was not willing to give the public access” to the art that he had acquired, Hershman said.

After Solow died, his son Stefan Soloviev (who uses a pre-Ellis Island family name) became chairman of the renamed Soloviev Group, and took “a completely different approach, to open the collection to the public,” Hershman said. The foundation, also renamed, “wanted to do something as a gift to the city, to let the city know that we’re operating in a much different mode than Sheldon operated in,” he added."

But these so-called threat notifications could, by Apple’s own admission, be a false alarm, and Mr. Modi’s government dismissed allegations that it was spying on the opposition, journalists and critics, as some speculated.

Tuesday’s figure could signal that progress on inflation is slowing. The closely watched core reading for October, which strips out food and fuel costs, is expected to show a 4.1 percent year-on-year gain. That’s no better than the September figure, and well above the Fed’s 2 percent target.

There may be more positive news in the headline figure. The overall number is forecast to have slowed to 3.3 percent, a decent improvement over the September level.

He shared the title of Time Magazine’s “Man of the Year” for 1972 with President Richard Nixon, to Mr. Nixon’s reported dismay.

Mr. Kissinger was adept at schmoozing reporters, enjoying a close relationship with many. He received a number of affectionate nicknames in the press, such as “Henry the K” and “super secretary.” A 1974 cover of Newsweek magazine depicted him as a superhero, bearing the headline “It’s Super-K!”.

Despite his short stature and glasses, Mr. Kissinger was seen as a sex symbol during the 1970s, with gossip columns devoting inches to the actresses he was seen with. His reputation as “the Playboy of the Western Wing” was something he helped to cultivate, telling Sally Quinn, then a society reporter for The Washington Post, “why don’t you assume I’m a secret swinger?” In a 1971 profile of Mr. Kissinger in WWD, headlined “I Wonder Who Is Kissing Now,” Mr. Kissinger compliments the reporter’s hot pants.

Maidan ushered in a nationwide cultural renewal, and Kyiv enjoyed an explosion of activity in art, fashion and, especially, electronic music. But the revolution, and the Russian annexation of Crimea and the war in the Donbas that followed, also triggered careless destruction of Kyiv’s Soviet-era public spaces, as nationalists took out their frustrations at the present on the monuments of the past.

From the start, through site-specific projects set amid Kyiv’s unloved and threatened 20th-century architecture, the biennial has tried to think through Ukraine’s Soviet history, rather than externalize it as some Russian intercession. That decolonial approach to the Soviet past has taken on profound new importance during the full-scale war. As Russia continues its direct assault on Ukrainian cultural heritage, Ukrainian authorities are ripping down statues and sanding away murals. The biennial has always striven for a subtler view of history, and in Vienna, the De Ne De Collective — a group of artists who have led preservation efforts for Soviet murals and mosaics in eastern Ukraine — has strewn one gallery with the shards of a chandelier from a destroyed cinema in Dnipro.

Yet this is decidedly not an “emergency” biennial, nor does it content itself with the hoary notion that an exhibition can stop the bombs from falling. (“They feel lots of solidarity,” Cherepanyn said mockingly of the audiences for those “raising-awareness” shows, “but then they go back to their everyday lives.”) By reuniting Ukrainian artists with European colleagues who showed in past biennials, such as Hito Steyerl and Wolfgang Tillmans, this show makes plain that Kyiv is already a central node in Europe’s cultural networks. The 2023 Kyiv Biennial does not want to show its Viennese public a calamity taking place “elsewhere.” It wants to demonstrate that we are all already facing threats to a common democratic future — and it is too late to duck the fight."

Mr. Blinken’s remarks came at the tail end of a NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels, where he and other Western diplomats sought to assuage doubts about Western resolve to help Kyiv amid Russia’s full-scale invasion. A White House proposal to send Ukraine additional emergency aid has stalled in the Republican-led House of Representatives, and the war in Gaza has consumed global attention.

“Some are questioning whether the United States and other NATO allies should continue to stand with Ukraine as we enter the second winter of Putin’s brutality,” Mr. Blinken said at a news conference in Brussels, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “But the answer here today at NATO is clear, and it’s unwavering. We must and we will continue to support ensuring that Russia’s war of aggression remains a strategic failure.”

He added that he expected that President Biden’s request for $61.4 billion in additional military and economic support for Ukraine would be approved by Congress."

It involves a Boston University study of athletes who played contact sports — like football — as children and died before turning 30, many by suicide. The Times has just published an interactive article about the study, including childhood videos of the athletes and filmed interviews with their parents.

The article begins with a heartbreaking recording that Wyatt Bramwell, who was 18 at the time, made minutes before shooting himself in 2019. “The voices and demons in my head just started to take over everything I wanted to do,” Bramwell tells the camera as he sits in the driver’s seat of his car. He goes on to ask his father to donate his brain to be studied. Bramwell then tells his family that he loves them and says goodbye.

He was one of the 152 athletes whose brains the Boston University researchers studied. More than 40 percent — 63 of the 152 — had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head. Of the 63, 48 had played football, while others had wrestled or played hockey or soccer. Some had never played beyond high school.

In the interviews with parents, they talk about what they would — or would not — have done differently."

“So now I am going to say, let’s go and see how we can help people who don’t have a sexual problem,” she said. “I don’t want to be known only as a sex therapist. I want to be known as a therapist.”

For Dr. Westheimer, this has meant turning her attention to what she views as the biggest need right now — the epidemic of loneliness in the United States. Her new goal: to become the Loneliness Ambassador for New York State.

When she began her quest sometime last year, no such position existed. So she enlisted the help of a state senator and began petitioning Gov. Kathy Hochul to create the role."

Mr. Toscani was once convicted of stabbing a group of Jewish men, and Mr. Correa has been accused of murdering a couple leaving a party. But this time, they were behind bars for attending what they said was a harmless barbecue.

The Brazilian authorities, however, say it was something far more sinister: a meeting of the Hammerskins, a neo-Nazi group founded in Dallas in 1988 that they say has recently found its way thousands of miles south, to Brazil’s most starkly conservative region, reflecting a surge in far-right extremists in Latin America’s largest nation.

The president’s efforts to focus attention on the domestic economy ahead of next year’s campaign have come after three weeks in which his administration has been seized by events overseas following the terrorist attacks in Israel and the country’s subsequent military action in Gaza.

Speaking in front of a tractor to a crowd in a machine shed, Mr. Biden credited “intense and urgent American diplomacy” for the evacuation on Wednesday of Americans, wounded Palestinians and other foreign nationals from Gaza. Then he pivoted to the economy at home.

He told a well-worn story of the “hollowing out of Main Street” and noted the more than 400,000 farms that have gone out of business in the past four decades, sending young people far from home to look for better job prospects.

“The pope’s activities continue as normal,” the statement said.

After meeting with the rabbis, Francis delivered a prepared speech to a volunteer association from Sicily and met with the new Brazilian and Swiss ambassadors to the Vatican. On Monday afternoon, the pope attended a gathering with about 7,000 children from around the world, where he appeared to be in good spirits, taking questions and accepting hugs from many attendees.

The pope’s health — he now frequently uses a cane or a wheelchair because of knee problems and sciatica — has been of increasing concern in recent years. He underwent major intestinal surgery in the summer of 2021, having roughly 13 inches of his large intestine removed because of what the Vatican said was inflammation that had caused a narrowing of his colon. In March of this year, he was treated for bronchitis that required hospitalization. Then in June, he spent nine days in the hospital after undergoing abdominal surgery.

Francis resumed a packed schedule after the latest surgery. In the months since his release from the hospital, he has traveled to Portugal, spent four days in Mongolia and taken a short trip to Marseille. The pope is scheduled to travel to Dubai next month for the United Nations climate summit.

Asked about his health during a televised interview on Italy’s national broadcaster RAI earlier this month, Francis said he still had a problem with his knee but that it was improving. He also mentioned his recent surgeries, saying: “now I am doing very well. I can eat everything.”"

But with Democratic opposition softening, it appeared the plan could be headed toward bipartisan approval within days.

The shifting alliances came as the House planned to take its first action on the bill as early as Tuesday. The legislation would fund federal agencies into early 2024 with two staggered deadlines, allowing lawmakers time to try to finish off the annual spending bills and putting off a debate over wartime aid to Israel and Ukraine.

It was reminiscent of the situation in the House about six weeks ago. Kevin McCarthy, the speaker at the time, was facing right-wing opposition to a measure to keep federal funding flowing and was forced to turn to Democrats to push through a temporary extension. The move cost Mr. McCarthy his speakership.

But Mr. Johnson — who is far more conservative than Mr. McCarthy — was not expected to face similar blowback from Republicans, who are not eager to repeat the dysfunction and paralysis that followed their last speaker’s ouster."

The stopgap spending bill he pushed through the House on Tuesday with overwhelming support from Democrats over the objections of a solid bloc of Republicans was a near-exact replica of the funding package he had opposed six weeks ago, when he was still an obscure lawmaker from Louisiana.

But as speaker, Mr. Johnson was forced to bow to the political reality that spending proposals designed to appease the far right cannot become law in a divided government. In doing so, he exhibited a pragmatic side that surprised Democrats and frustrated allies on the right who just days ago were exultant at his sudden rise.

Mr. Johnson made the calculation that House Republicans, divided and known more for acrimony than accomplishment these days, could not afford to be held responsible for a crippling pre-Thanksgiving government shutdown."

The move ended five days of drama that had gripped Silicon Valley and beyond. Altman and those focused more on commercializing the technology came out ahead of those worried about its apocalyptic potential. But the episode raises questions about what comes next.

OpenAI’s board will be revamped. Gone are Tasha McCauley, Helen Toner and Ilya Sutskever, three of the four directors who ousted Altman.

That board will help select a bigger permanent one, according to The Verge, which may include representation for Microsoft, OpenAI’s biggest investor.

Even in silence, symmetrical features announce their presence and elicit a reaction: desire, admiration, curiosity, resentment, belittlement, rage or envy. The response is rarely neutral.

In this way, beautiful people are different from comedians who have to work for a crowd’s attention. Comics choreograph their lines, pauses and gestures to get a laugh. Then they practice, and fail, and practice more. Why would an attractive person toil for a reaction if they don’t have to?

This is why my colleague Jason Zinoman, The Times’s comedy critic, recently chose to disclose a bias of his: He is skeptical of attractive men in comedy. And he isn’t alone. The conventional wisdom is that male comics need to be relatable, not hot, lest their beauty distract from the bit. But that may be changing.

Stand-up stages are crawling with beautiful men. Chris Rock is showing off his abs. Jimmy Fallon smiles boyishly on late night. Trevor Noah and his dimples date actresses. An industry once known for nerdy, affable guys — Jerry Seinfeld, Bob Newhart, Jim Gaffigan — is becoming another venue for charmers.

On Feb. 6, 1904, a group of powerful Jewish men met at the Fifth Avenue mansion of Jacob Schiff. Largely forgotten today (except by antisemitic conspiracy theorists), Schiff was a German immigrant who became one of the most powerful bankers on the planet, “a colossus in finance and Jewish life,” Daniel Schulman writes in “The Money Kings.”

That night, Schiff’s guests — who included Adolph Ochs, the publisher of The New York Times, and Oscar Straus, President Theodore Roosevelt’s minister to The Hague — were talking about the looming war between Japan and Russia. Schiff knocked on the table for silence and announced that he had been approached about arranging a loan to the Japanese government to help fund the war. Then he asked the same question my grandfather used to ask: What does it mean for the Jews?

That question recurs throughout “The Money Kings,” a sprawling history of the German Jews who came to the United States in the 19th century and helped create the modern economy while navigating their own identities as Jews, bankers and Americans.

Schiff is the book’s central figure, and by the early 20th century, on the eve of the Russo-Japanese War, his influence had spread beyond Wall Street. At the time, Jews were being raped and murdered in yet another series of pogroms in imperial Russia. These attacks burned such a lasting scar on the Jewish psyche that, earlier this year, an Israeli major general was moved to compare the slaughter of Israeli civilians on Oct. 7 to “a pogrom from our grandparents’ time.”"

He brought that question to his brother Ryan, a tech whiz who had invented a type of wireless cellphone charger when he was in college. After Brandon Tseng left the military, he joined with his brother to find ways to apply technology to national security challenges and quickly had what he remembers as his “aha” moment.

The rapidly emerging field of artificial intelligence, he believed, could be applied to fast-evolving hardware like drones to transform how they are used in war, like sending a tiny, self-piloted vehicle to do reconnaissance inside a structure that troops were about to enter. Even fighter jets could perhaps be turned into A.I.-controlled robot drones.

The company the Tseng brothers created in 2015, named Shield AI, is now valued by venture capital investors at $2.7 billion. The firm has 625 employees in Texas, California, Virginia and Abu Dhabi.

So after briefly writing about the issue of forced population transfer in Gaza a few weeks ago, I picked up “Making Minorities History” by Matthew Frank, a historian at Leeds University in England.

In the early 20th century, Frank writes, governments in Europe became convinced that “population transfers” — a euphemistic term for forcibly expelling minority groups to the countries they supposedly “belonged” to because of their backgrounds — were a way to prevent and resolve wars.

Many of the people who were enamored of population transfer in Europe later came to support the establishment of Israel as a Jewish homeland, because they either wanted to remove them as a minority within Europe or thought that doing so was the best way to ensure their safety."

Unlike other presidents who have celebrated birthdays with lavish political events, Mr. Biden plans to observe his milestone privately with family in Nantucket later this week.

The best birthday gift the oldest president in American history could hope for would be a strategy for assuaging voters’ concerns, but that has been hard to come by. Mr. Biden and his team have taken the approach that his record of domestic legislation and international leadership should belie any worries about his capacity, even though polls have shown consistently that that line of argument has not been persuasive, at least not yet.

Some Democrats argue that Mr. Biden needs to do more to draw the contrast with his likeliest Republican challenger, former President Donald J. Trump, who at 77 has himself exhibited confusion in public lately. Mr. Trump has warned that the country is on the verge of World War II, mixed up the leaders of Hungary and Turkey, and boasted of beating former President Barack Obama in the polls when of course Mr. Obama is not running.

That novel, “Prophet Song,” which imagines a near-future Ireland descending into totalitarianism, then a civil war that leads to families’ fleeing the country, has won the Booker Prize, the prestigious literary award.

On Sunday, Esi Edugyan, a novelist and the chair of this year’s judging panel, said that “Prophet Song” resonated with contemporary crises including the Israel-Hamas war, but that the novel had won solely on its literary merits. “This is a triumph of emotional storytelling, bracing and brave,” Edugyan said in a news conference before the announcement.

The judges weren’t unanimous in their decision, even after six hours of debate, Edugyan said. Still, she added, the panel felt that “Prophet Song” was a worthy winner that “captures the social and political anxieties of our current moment.”"
689,689,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/us/kissinger-state-department-diplomacy.html,"When Henry Kissinger turned 100 this year, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken toasted him at one birthday celebration in New York, and the C.I.A. director, William J. Burns, did so at another in Washington. There was a reason: Kissinger managed to retain his role as adviser to Washington’s key policymakers a half century after he left office, oftentimes because what he did then was so relevant to the crises of today.

Mr. Kissinger spoke with Mr. Blinken regularly, including as recently as last month, Mr. Blinken said. He had also consulted with previous secretaries of state, including Condoleezza Rice, Hillary Clinton (who took heat for those conversations during her presidential campaign), John Kerry and Mike Pompeo. But he wasn’t some retired coach, reminiscing about the good old days. Instead, he remained the ultimate back-channeller, especially to leaders in China.

In July, Mr. Kissinger secretly flew to China — by private jet, since it’s an arduous flight even if you are not 100 years old — at the specific invitation of Xi Jinping, who called him an “old friend” and, during a lengthy dinner, told him “China and the United States’ relations will forever be linked to the name ‘Kissinger.’”

It was a calculated move. Mr. Xi was making clear that he wanted to move back toward the warmth that surrounded President Richard M. Nixon’s opening to China in the early 1970s, engineered by Mr. Kissinger in secret interchanges and a remarkable, also secret trip to China. And the July visit helped set up Mr. Xi’s summit meeting with President Biden, outside of San Francisco, this month.

On that same trip, Mr. Kissinger was celebrated at the U.S. Embassy, where R. Nicholas Burns, the current U.S. ambassador, lives in a house that Mr. Kissinger helped get constructed when the United States had a representative to China, but full diplomatic recognition had not yet happened.

Mr. Kissinger met with the embassy’s vast staff, talking about what the process of opening the relationship was like — in an era when it seemed inconceivable China would become the world’s second-largest economy."

The debate has come during what national security officials say is a surge in threats fueled by the Israel-Hamas war.

But whether lawmakers will reach consensus and pass any bill that would renew the law, known as Section 702, before the deadline on New Year’s Eve remains far from clear. National security officials have lobbied Congress for nearly a year to reauthorize the law, and privacy advocates have urged lawmakers to include various reforms in any legislation.

Surveillance law scrambles the usual partisan lines, with national security hawks and civil liberties-minded lawmakers on both sides. Dysfunction in the Republican majority that controls the House has only complicated talks, and by week’s end, the chamber is set to be in session only 12 more days.

Here is a closer look at the state of play.

What is Section 702?

It is a surveillance law that authorizes the government to collect the communications of foreigners abroad who have been targeted for intelligence purposes — even when those targets are talking with or about Americans. The information can come from American companies like Google and AT&T and without a warrant."

How could this mutual slaughter be happening, so suddenly, and on this scale? I thought of the American poet Walt Whitman’s stuttering shocked reaction to America’s Civil War. “The dead, the dead, the dead,” he keened, “Our dead — South or North, ours all, all, all, all.”

Another, later American poet and political activist, Muriel Rukeyser (1913-1980), might have been less surprised by the present catastrophe and the images it’s generating. “It is the history of the idea of war that is beneath our other histories,“ she coolly wrote in the late 1940s, early in the bitter long Cold War that followed World War II. War, with its guarantee of violence, she was saying, is always in progress somewhere, maybe everywhere, in one of three predictable stages: preparation, detonation, cleanup.

This long view of war as a perpetual reality, always nascent, always realized, is the major subject of the work of the American-Vietnamese photographer An-My Lê, whose lucid New York survey opens at the Museum of Modern Art this Sunday. And one of her specific points of reference is the American War in Vietnam, which she directly experienced."

Some said he was too old, or they didn’t think he’d done much as president. Black voters in particular said they didn’t believe he was doing enough to help Black Americans.

They also point to the opportunities for Mr. Biden. Though many said they’d probably vote for Mr. Trump, nearly all said that they weren’t excited about either option, and that Mr. Trump had personally offended them. For some, Democratic messaging on issues important to them, like abortion and the economy, hadn’t reached them.

In a telling indication of how unsettled voters remain with a year to go, many of them expressed different opinions during the follow-up interviews than they did during the survey. In response to neutral questions, some who had said they were unsure became more sure of their support for either candidate by the end of the interview, and others switched their support after recalling their impressions of both candidates and talking more about their priority issues.

A telephone call with a New York Times reporter is not the same as a conversation with friends or family. It’s not the same as a campaign advertisement, either. But it was an opportunity for a group of voters, some of them relatively disengaged, to think about the candidates, issues and campaigns.

Here’s how the Harris supporters broke down:

693,693,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/opinion/nikki-haley-high-heels.html,"Ms. Haley seemed to know she’d gain more by shutting down a male jerk with humor than by letting the moment go. A bit later, too, when Mr. Ramaswamy brought up Ms. Haley’s daughter’s use of TikTok, an unusually personal attack on a family member, Ms. Haley spoke for many when she said, “You’re just scum.”

Now imagine Ms. Haley on the debate stage with Mr. Trump. Maybe Mr. Trump has imagined it. Maybe that’s why he’s afraid to debate her.

Whether you love or hate these playground-style duels, these moments can be more consequential than many of us assume. Most Americans are not reading deeply into the platforms of each candidate; they get glimpses of them in public performances like this and often form opinions around them. So when a moment like this goes viral, often it matters even more. “People get to see whether you could stand your ground or hold your own,” said Tristan Bridges, a sociologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies gender politics. “And they’re just intensely gendered, every time, no matter who’s running.”

Masculinity contests have long been a part of politics; for years, war heroes and combat veterans won office or their party’s presidential nominations, as other men sought to project traditionally masculine characteristics like toughness, resolve, seriousness, strength. In the 2008 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton ran for president staking out some hawkish positions on Iraq and foreign policy; her image of toughness helped her at first, given the ongoing threats from the war on terror. But she became caught up in questions about her likability, with none other than Barack Obama delivering if not a Ramaswamy comment, then still a pretty gendered one in a hushed aside at a critical debate: “You’re likable enough, Hillary.”

No woman runs for office these days without having some way of responding to such digs, and Ms. Haley has practiced. As far back as 2012, she’s been recycling a version of her heels-as-ammunition line. As governor of South Carolina: “I’ve got a completely male Senate. Do I want to use these for kicking? Sometimes, I do.” During an address to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee: “If I see something wrong, we’re going to kick them every single time.” In her official campaign announcement: “You should know this about me: I don’t put up with bullies. And when you kick back, it hurts them more if you’re wearing heels.”"

If the planet is to avoid even more severe consequences from global warming, the world’s leading energy agency says, consumption of oil, coal and natural gas needs to be reduced much more rapidly, and clean energy sources like wind and solar power need to expand at a far faster pace.

But the stock market doesn’t seem to have gotten the memo.

Instead, the shares of a broad range of clean energy companies have been crushed lately, in a rout that encompasses just about every alternative energy sector, including solar, wind and geothermal power.

At the same time, rather than weaning themselves off oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the two biggest U.S. oil companies, are doubling down. They have announced acquisitions that will vastly increase their oil reserves. Exxon intends to buy Pioneer Natural Resources, a major shale drilling company, for $59.5 billion. Chevron plans a $53 billion purchase of Hess, a big integrated oil company. These are enormous bets on oil for years to come.

It’s a perplexing state of affairs. The evidence that carbon emissions are warming the planet is persuasive. Yet the stock market, which is supposed to be forward-looking, is treating alternative energy companies with disdain and big oil companies with respect."

One-sixteenth of an inch equals one foot in the world of ships that have never been splashed by a wave or fired their guns.

Daughtry, 91, is one of nearly 119,000 veterans in New York City, according to Census Bureau data. The state Health Department said in 2021 there were 25 veterans for every 1,000 residents in Manhattan, where Veterans Day began with a parade 104 years ago today. The date was later moved to Nov. 11 — Armistice Day, the day World War I ended, and the observance became Veterans Day in 1954.

Daughtry said he had joined the Marines for one reason. “I’ve always been a person who never shunned a challenge,” he said. “I told myself, ‘Let me see if I can do this.’” If he could make it through basic training in the Marine Corps, he could do anything.

Soon he was in the Second Division, 19th Infantry Battalion, during the Korean War.

He had put models together from kits when he was a teenager — plastic gunboats and wooden airplanes with rubber bands to drive the propellers. And, after the Marine Corps, he was trained as an architectural draftsman. He found a job in Montreal and worked there in the 1960s and 1970s. The company he worked for promoted him to project manager when it had a contract for work on Ben-Gurion International Airport in Israel.

In his spare time, he still made models — more intricate ones. He has built three Navy cruisers and a model of the battleship U.S.S. Arizona, which sank in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor."

What will you be listening for?

If you think of the story of Donald Trump, it’s the story of his money. It’s his essence, and that is why he is so agitated about this trial. He has been lying about his net worth for so long, I think he has come to believe the false narrative he has laid down.

His first defense is likely to be he was busy building buildings, flying around in helicopters and signing autographs and didn’t have time for the minutiae of appraisals and submitting forms to banks. He left that to his accountants and his lawyers.

He’s also likely to say that there were disclaimers in the financial statements that effectively make them meaningless.

And, of course, you will hear his assets aren’t just worth a lot; many of them are priceless.

Trump was testy when Justice Engoron called him to the stand before issuing a gag order during the first week of the trial. How snappish will Trump be today?"

It said it would initially focus on New Hampshire, where Republican voters are more moderate than in many other states — and, crucially, where voters who are not registered with a party can choose to participate in the Republican or Democratic primary race.

After the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23, the group will turn to South Carolina — Ms. Haley’s home state — and to “selected Super Tuesday states with open primaries,” according to a memo shared with The New York Times.

“We all believe that Nikki Haley is an outstanding leader,” the memo says. “She has by far the best electability of any Republican presidential candidate in 2024. We are convinced that our efforts will not be futile, as some may fear, and that Donald Trump does not inevitably have to be the Republican candidate — not at all.”

The founders of the super PAC are Frank Laukien, the chief executive of a life-science research and diagnostics company; Jonathan Bush, the founder and chief executive of a health-care data company and a cousin of former President George W. Bush; Bonnie Anderson, the founder and chief executive of a cancer testing company; Robert Fisher, a white-collar defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor; and Tamra Laukien, the founder and chief executive of a health and wellness coaching company, who is married to Mr. Laukien.

They said in the memo that they saw Ms. Haley “as a forward-thinking, next-generation leader, whose vision, values, integrity, optimism and energy make her the best choice as the Republican presidential candidate.” They did not discuss specific policies but broadly praised her positions on issues including inflation, taxes, support for Ukraine and Israel, and border security."

The musicians arrived there last week to mark the 50th anniversary of the orchestra’s celebrated 1973 visit to Beijing, when it became the first American ensemble to perform in Communist-led China as the two countries worked to re-establish official ties.

(Projections are by Brad Peterson, sound design by Dan Moses Schreier.) “Amid Falling Walls,” though, relies heavily on lyrics and spoken text, almost all of it in Yiddish; non-Yiddish speakers, like me, will spend the performance reading supertitles, which are in English and Russian.

The placement of those titles, far above the actors’ heads on a set by Jessica Alexandra Cancino, fundamentally thwarts this fast-paced pageant, whose arc takes it from the Vilna Ghetto, in what is now Lithuania, to a displaced persons camp in Germany. It becomes a fragmented experience: Take our eyes off the titles and we’re lost for meaning, but read only the titles and we miss the show. Either way, the fullness of the production’s emotion and artistry remains out of reach.

Curated by Avram Mlotek, who wrote the libretto, and his father, Zalmen Mlotek, who is the show’s music director and arranger as well as the company’s artistic director, “Amid Falling Walls” sounds gorgeous. Its 28 musical numbers — folk music and cabaret, elegies and anthems — are played by a nine-piece orchestra tucked away upstage. And the show has an ace in its fine eight-person ensemble: Steven Skybell, who starred as Tevye in the National Yiddish Theater Folksbiene’s excellent Yiddish-language production of “Fiddler on the Roof.”

One of Skybell’s songs here, Reuven Lipshitz’s “Motele From the Warsaw Ghetto,” is the rare number in the show with a tempo slow enough to allow both reading the titles and watching the performance, which in its restraint is absolutely searing: the story of a boy, not yet 13, doing his part to resist the Nazis — sneaking in and out of the ghetto — and dying for it.

“Humanity’s most true history is written only in blood,” Skybell says in English near the top of the show, and it is an arresting line. But before bloodshed comes the process of dehumanization that features in all ethnic hatred, and “Amid Falling Walls” delineates that vividly."
701,701,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/technology/elon-musk-twitter-x-advertisers.html,"More major advertisers have paused their spending on X, the social media service formerly known as Twitter, as the backlash continued over Elon Musk’s endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory on X.

The entertainment company Warner Bros. Discovery and Sony have joined other prominent brands in halting their spending on X. IBM cut off its advertising on X on Thursday, while Apple, Lionsgate, the entertainment and film distribution company, and Paramount Global, the media giant that owns CBS, all paused their ads on Friday.

The spending freeze comes as X has fought to win back advertisers who were wary of spending on the platform after Mr. Musk took it over a year ago and said he would loosen content moderation rules. Major brands tend to be cautious about placing their ads next to posts with offensive or hateful speech.

Mr. Musk, who bought Twitter in October 2022 and renamed it X, drew scrutiny this week after replying to a post on X that accused Jewish people who are facing antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war of pushing the “exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them” and supporting the immigration of “hordes of minorities.”

“You have said the actual truth,” Mr. Musk replied. Jewish groups said that Mr. Musk’s message boosted a conspiracy theory known as replacement theory, which claims that Jews have organized nonwhite immigrants to replace the white race. The concept was embraced by Robert Bowers, who killed 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018.

Mr. Musk’s statement drew condemnation from the White House on Friday. Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that it was “unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust.”

Mr. Musk lashed out at advertisers who had pulled their dollars from X on Friday, and threatened legal action against Media Matters, a left-wing advocacy organization that said it found antisemitic content on X and highlighted advertisements for Apple, IBM and other brands that appeared alongside posts touting Hitler and the Nazi Party.

In a post on Friday night, Mr. Musk said, “The split second court opens on Monday, X Corp will be filing a thermonuclear lawsuit against Media Matters and ALL those who colluded in this fraudulent attack on our company.”

X said that the research strategy used by Media Matters to discover the advertisements that ran along antisemitic content was not representative of how regular people use its platform. The organization followed accounts that posted the content, then refreshed the X timeline until ads appeared, X said in a blog post. Only one of the nine posts highlighted by Media Matters violated its content moderation rules, X added.

In a statement, Joe Benarroch, the head of business operations at X, said, “50 impressions served against the content in the article, out of 5.5 billion served the whole day, points to the fact of how efficiently our model avoids content for advertisers.” He added, “Data wins over allegations.”

Media Matters said that it would defend itself from litigation by X. “Far from the free speech advocate he claims to be, Musk is a bully threatening a meritless lawsuit in an attempt to silence reporting that he even confirmed is accurate,” said Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters. “Musk admitted the ads at issue ran alongside the pro-Nazi content we identified. This is like getting mad at a mirror because you don’t like the reflection. If he does sue us, we will win.”

He can now be seen pressing and seasoning onion-thatched portions of ground beef on the griddle at his first Hamburger America, a sunny restaurant with counter seats, booths and takeout, in SoHo. The restaurant’s name is that of his 2004 documentary film, a project that took him around the country researching hamburgers, and subsequent guidebook. In partnership with the owners of the Schnipper’s casual American restaurants, he serves a flattened fried onion burger with American cheese, and a classic smashburger with optional cheese and condiments, $7.25 for a single on a toasted, buttered potato roll, or $11.50 for a double. The meat is prime chuck, 75 percent lean. As for why the smashed burgers, they go back to what he says were the original hamburgers sold in the United States for more than 100 years. “I like history,” he said. There are fries, a few sandwiches, flavored milks including a chocolate egg cream, and Miller High Life, as well. Early next year he will invite guest hamburger makers from around the country on a monthly basis to serve their specialties. (Opens Wednesday)

In public, the company has announced its staggering growth with a steady cadence of news releases. They have included agreements with European pharmaceutical giants like AstraZeneca and a $100 million deal with a Silicon Valley firm to build what the companies boast will be the “world’s largest supercomputer.” Last month, G42 announced a partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.

But in classified American intelligence channels, there have been more concerning reports about the company. The C.I.A. and other American spy agencies have issued warnings about G42’s work with large Chinese companies that U.S. officials consider security threats, including Huawei, the telecommunications giant that is under U.S. sanctions.

U.S. officials fear G42 could be a conduit by which advanced American technology is siphoned to Chinese companies or the government. The intelligence reports have also warned that G42’s dealings with Chinese firms could be a pipeline to get the genetic data of millions of Americans and others into the hands of the Chinese government, according to two officials familiar with the reports."

The recommendation comes with the caveat that Ukraine must take steps to address corruption, protect minorities and limit the power of oligarchs.

“Ukraine continues to face tremendous hardship and tragedy provoked by Russia’s war of aggression,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the body’s executive branch. “And yet the Ukrainians are deeply reforming their country, even as they are fighting a war that is existential for them.”

711,711,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/world/europe/russia-nuclear-test-ban-treaty.html,"Since the United States has never ratified the treaty, Russia’s move was more symbolic than practical. But it leaves only one significant nuclear weapons pact between Russia and the United States in place: the New START treaty.

What is the nuclear testing treaty?

The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, or CTBT, was an attempt under the umbrella of the United Nations to ban all nuclear tests. Adopted in 1996, it never came into effect because not enough key countries, including the United States, have ratified it. In Washington, efforts to ratify it have broken down repeatedly, largely along partisan lines, with Republican administrations arguing that despite a U.S. moratorium on new tests, future improvements or modifications in the nuclear arsenal might require them.

What does Russia’s decision mean?

Russia, in de-ratifying the treaty, removed another brick in the wall of formal arms control intended to limit proliferation. Though the move was mostly symbolic, it added to the recent sense of menace fostered by Mr. Putin and other hard-line Kremlin officials.

The hard-liners have been rattling the nuclear saber as a threat to others not to intervene in the Ukraine war, arguing that an atomic blast — in Ukraine, in Europe, or maybe in a test over Siberia — was a sure means to resurrect Western fear of Russian might. At a conference this year, Mr. Putin mentioned that Moscow had successfully tested a new nuclear-powered cruise missile with global reach. Russia trumpeted it as part of a newly robust arsenal of strategic nuclear weapons, though analysts widely believed it to be far from operational. It is unclear, however, whether Russia will resume tests of nuclear warheads.

What nuclear treaties are still in effect?

The New START is the only nuclear weapons deal between the United States and Russia. Although Mr. Putin announced last February that Russia was suspending its participation, Russia has thus far stuck to the treaty limits. Intended to institute verifiable limits on deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, it caps the number of nuclear warheads on each side at 1,550. The treaty, which came into effect in 2011, expires in February 2026."

But let us be clear: There are additional threats that also demand our action — threats that are currently causing harm and which, to many people, also feel existential.”

Ms. Harris’s speech, during which she fleshed out a sweeping executive order President Biden signed this week, included a distinct emphasis on consumer protections and how A.I. could exacerbate existing inequalities.

But we shouldn’t lose sight of how annual efforts to pass spending bills have changed. They are now one of the highest-stakes elements of the congressional workload. The showdowns and shutdowns, threatened and realized, don’t occur in a vacuum but are a symptom of the broader challenges — some would say dysfunction — that have often plagued Congress.

The budget process has become less about major fights over taxing and spending and more about the ways in which this fundamental congressional responsibility can be undermined by narrow partisan conflicts and performative politicking. The kind of brinkmanship we saw this week, and even more so in September, is becoming the new normal for the budget process. Unfortunately we may be in for another round in early 2024.

He doesn’t want to look like a guy who’s been driven from office.

If Trump manages to escape conviction in Jack Smith’s Washington case, which may be the only criminal trial that ends before the election, that’s going to turbocharge his campaign. Of course, if he’s convicted, that could turbocharge his campaign even more.

It’s a perfect playing field for the maleficent Trump: He learned in the 2016 race that physical and rhetorical violence could rev up his base. He told me at the time that it helped get him to No. 1, and he said he found violence at his rallies exciting.

He has no idea why making fun of Paul Pelosi’s injuries at the hands of one of his acolytes is subhuman, any more than he understood how repellent it was in 2015 when he mocked a disabled Times reporter. He gets barbaric laughs somehow, and that’s all he cares about.

The last speaker who prevented a shutdown, Kevin McCarthy, was booted from his position by Republican extremists for working with Democrats to pass a stopgap bill.

Mr. Johnson might have tried to appease the howling kennel on the far right by throwing it a treat in exchange for support, as he did with the I.R.S. enforcement money. But on this bill, he didn’t. There were no policy riders or crazy demands for cuts, and as a result, all but two House Democrats voted for it. Republicans, on the other hand, split into their usual camps. Most of the caucus — the 127 members who are, for convenience’s sake, called centrists, though few of them really are — voted for the bill, but 93 said no. Many of them said they oppose the idea of stopgap bills on principle, and they don’t care what damage a shutdown would do to the economy or the country’s reputation.

Any of those 93 could call for Mr. Johnson’s ouster, but that’s not going to happen this round. The calculation seems to be that the new speaker is still in some kind of honeymoon period, that no one wants another embarrassing speaker fight or that members want to get home for Thanksgiving without a shutdown hanging over their heads. The far right never trusted Mr. McCarthy, but feels a kinship with Mr. Johnson’s fringe cultural positions. But underlying it all is the desire for some running room for the big spending fight to come this winter.

The stopgap bill is weird because it punts that fight to two dates. On Jan. 19, funding will run out for a group of agencies including those handling transportation, housing, energy, agriculture and veterans’ affairs. On Feb. 2, funding will run out for everything else, including the Pentagon. The danger of that approach is that the far right could create a partial shutdown on Jan. 19 of agencies they don’t care about, which is the kind of bloody trophy many of them would be proud to carry home and wave around.

That kind of threat could really become reality, along with a full shutdown on Feb. 2, because the extremists are eager to start demanding their favorite policy provisions in the full-year spending bills for each agency that will be necessary after the stopgap. (Mr. Johnson has said he won’t do any more stopgaps, known as continuing resolutions.)"

The polling verification system was overwhelmed with an influx of votes after the American comedian John Oliver ran a self-described “alarmingly aggressive” campaign for the little-known pūteketeke — also known as the Australasian crested grebe — which he described as “weird puking birds with colorful mullets.”

Mr. Oliver paid for billboard advertisements in a number of countries including New Zealand, France, Japan and the United States, encouraging residents to vote in the poll — which is not restricted to New Zealanders.

“This is what democracy is all about: America interfering in foreign elections,” Mr. Oliver said on his weekly show, “Last Week Tonight.” He also highlighted some of the unique traits of the species, including carrying their young on their back and a mating dance in which “they both grab a clump of wet grass and chest bump each other before standing around unsure of what to do next.”"

Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February last year, our paths had barely crossed. As a lecturer, researcher and volunteer, I went back and forth between Ukraine and Britain. My friend, meanwhile, traveled across Ukraine as a local producer for foreign journalists covering the war. It was important work. But on Oct. 7, a media trip my friend had been organizing to eastern Ukraine was canceled. The crew instead left for the Middle East.

“They leave Ukraine because the front is moving slowly,” my friend told me when we met at her place in Kyiv. “The journalists will be back in no time once we liberate any significant patch of land.”

Liberate another significant patch of occupied territories and discover another mass grave, I thought. That would, for a few days, refresh the world’s memory of what Ukraine is up against. The delivery of a dozen more tanks might follow, perhaps, along with some renewed talk of commitment. But with enough weapons to keep fighting but not to win, Ukraine is at a stalemate, as Gen. Valery Zaluzhny recently confirmed. Those of us not in the trenches must continue selling Ukrainian resistance to the world, telling our stories in the hope of support.

For 20 months, I have been churning out essays on why the world should stay focused on Ukraine. I have written them in a bomb shelter in Lviv, in a train packed with refugees in Poland, in a bathroom during an air raid in Kyiv and in the back seat of a car returning from near-frontline towns.

Mr. Biden wished Mr. Xi’s wife a happy birthday. Mr. Xi replied with embarrassment that he had forgotten her birthday was approaching because he had been working so much. At another point, Mr. Biden brandished a picture of a younger Mr. Xi standing on the Golden Gate Bridge.

“I said, ‘I wanted to show you a picture,’” Mr. Biden said Wednesday evening at a reception for leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit that Mr. Xi did not attend. “He said, ‘I like that picture.’ Well, he was translated to say, ‘I like that picture.’” At a high-dollar dinner across town, Mr. Xi hinted that giant pandas, which he called “envoys of friendship” between the two countries, could be returning to the United States. Only one U.S. zoo is left with a pair after Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington returned two aging adult pandas and their cub to China earlier this month as previously agreed.

Mr. Biden eventually pierced the “Kumbaya” moment by telling reporters after the carefully coordinated summit that he still considered the Chinese leader a dictator. Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, called Mr. Biden’s comment “extremely wrong.”

Dealing with leaders who have unsavory politics is part of presidential diplomacy. Mr. Biden’s predecessor, Donald J. Trump, enjoyed buddying up with such leaders — once in a friendly summit with Vladimir V.

Is that what’s happening here? Is this real?

She is gaining in the places that matter. And she is running the campaign she’s run before: hard-core conservative on fiscal matters and immigration, kitchen-table pragmatic on basically everything else. A plaintive quality in Ms. Haley’s voice joins up well with the grim statistics she shares about kids’ reading and math proficiency since the pandemic and about what happens to veterans after they come home. She spends a good deal of time talking about U.S. support for Ukraine (and Israel) as bulwarks against further deterioration of the world order while outlining a hawkish “peace through strength” approach toward China.

There are a hundred little switches that would need to flip from now, in a big mousetrap-style path, toward victory. If a bloc of Republican voters’ support for Donald Trump is as soft as some polling indicates and if Ms. Haley could somehow continue to elevate herself the rest of the way, the race for the G.O.P. nomination would turn brutal — and volatile confrontation with Mr. Trump would be inevitable. Survivors of such moments have been rare, but for those few, like Brian Kemp, the Georgia governor, survival becomes a position of strength. Maybe people forgot Ms. Haley’s early campaigns in favor of the easy relationship she had with Mr. Trump, but they might prove instructive.

In person, her campaign feels different from Mr. Trump’s and those of the other challengers; if she agrees with them on immigration, the tone and emphasis on much of the rest differ. This includes her general impulse toward knocking Washington (both Republicans and Democrats) rather than the cultural Marxists that animate most Republican visions of what ails the country. You are, in general, unlikely to hear at another national Republican event answers about access to contraceptives, the importance of attracting and training more mental health counselors or even a slight openness to the idea of businesses transitioning to the use of electric vehicles (if on a longer time frame than the Biden administration’s and only after Ms. Haley goes on a long riff about calling out China and India). In Nikki Haley, these things flow fluidly alongside outlines of her plan to raise the retirement age for the youngest generation or extended and hard comments about the border, including a reactionary “it only takes one” warning about terrorism."

(That’s despite Trump being nearly as unpopular and fighting multiple legal battles; he is taking the stand on Monday in one of them. And, on PredictIt, which is watched by political experts, Biden holds a six-point lead on Trump.)

A glaring weakness for Biden remains the economy, despite signs that it’s doing well and efforts by the White House to promote its accomplishments. Experts say it’s still possible for the president to make a comeback — but when it comes to economic issues, that’s a tough task.

Just 2 percent of voters said the economy was excellent, the poll found. Worryingly for Biden, that discontent is being reflected in demographics crucial to his re-election: 48 percent of Black voters in the Times/Siena poll rated the economy as poor, as did 59 percent of voters under 30. Zero respondents in that age group in Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin rated the economy as excellent.

Biden’s struggles are Trump’s gain. Likely voters trust the former president on the economy more than the current one by wide margins: 57 percent of those under 30 prefer Trump, as do 55 percent of Hispanics, 52 percent of women and a majority of people in every income bracket."

My colleague Sarah Kessler recently wrote about how opting for remote work may make it harder for women to get ahead in their careers. Because office attendance is still often seen as a proxy for productivity, working remotely full time, or working more days from home than others do in a hybrid workplace, could become an updated version of the “mommy track,” a career path in which flexibility comes at the price of lost chances for advancement.

Sarah told me that she began thinking about this issue after hearing company executives lament that employees were taking a break around 5 p.m. to pick up their children from day care and then logging back on at night to finish their work. In other words, some employers were frowning upon the flexibility of remote work.

“The modern work force and the traditional views of what hard work needs to look like don’t add up,” Sarah said. “If companies hire both mothers and fathers, someone is going to have to leave their job on time to pick up the kids. So why is it seen as such a bad thing?”"

That a British immigration policy involving one-way flights to an East African country would have implications for Northern Ireland is one of the strange, second-order effects of Britain’s membership in the European Convention on Human Rights, an international accord it helped draft after World War II.

And the fact that it would catch the eye of Washington speaks to the sensitivity of Northern Ireland in the trans-Atlantic relationship.

Not if he’s beaten by a Republican who had to buy into his fictions or emulate his ugliness to claim the prize. Not if the Republican Party remains hostage to the extremism on display in the House over these past few months.

That assessment isn’t Trump derangement syndrome. It’s straightforward observation, consistent with Liz Cheney’s new memoir, “Oath and Honor,” at which my Times colleague Peter Baker got an advance peek. Cheney describes House Republicans’ enduring surrender to Trump as cowardly and cynical, and she’s cleareyed on what his nomination in 2024 would mean. “We will be voting on whether to preserve our republic,” she writes. “As a nation, we can endure damaging policies for a four-year term. But we cannot survive a president willing to terminate our Constitution.”

They’re not just theater, either. Long gone are the days when Trump’s darkest comments and direst vows could be dismissed as perverse performance art — as huffing and puffing that wouldn’t and couldn’t amount to all that much. That soothing myth died once and for all during the final months of his presidency, when he layered the Big Lie atop the heaving mountain of little and medium-size ones and cheered on a mob making its way to the Capitol.

And the notion that he’d at some point be contained by fellow Republicans who would put up with only so much? What a quaint hope that was. Most of those Republicans cowered before him. Most still do. The two current runners-up for the Republican presidential nomination, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, raised their hands when they were asked, during a debate in August, about whether they’d support Trump as the party’s nominee even if he was convicted of felonies. That’s why the stakes of this election are titanic even without Trump on the ballot. The stain of him is deep and wide."
732,732,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/09/opinion/republican-debate-winners-losers.html,"Welcome to Opinion’s commentary for the third Republican presidential debate, held in Miami on Wednesday night. In this special feature, Times Opinion writers and contributors rate the candidates on a scale of 0 to 10: 0 means the candidate probably didn’t belong on the stage and should have dropped out before the debate even started; 10 means the candidate can head to Iowa and New Hampshire with the wind at his or her back. Here’s what our columnists and contributors thought about the debate.

Jamelle Bouie On abortion, at least, Nikki Haley knows how to sound like a moderate. And if this were an actually competitive presidential nomination process, you’d be hard-pressed not to see Haley as far and away the most viable candidate for the general election.

Gail Collins Well, she certainly beat all the boys. Such as they were.

Michelle Cottle Very strong showing. The heavy foreign policy focus played to her strengths. Whether talking Ukraine, Iran, Israel or China, she was crisp and confident. She refused to let her opponents’ attacks go unanswered. She landed solid punches on DeSantis. And it was a delight to watch her smack back at Ramaswamy’s yapping.

Ross Douthat I’m not sure she won all her arguments with Ramaswamy, but the stylistic contrast between them has been a boon for her. Likewise, her abortion answer was fundamentally evasive but rhetorically more effective, with its show of nuance, than most of the answers from her rivals. The debate didn’t answer the question of whether she can really cut into DeSantis’s more conservative bloc of support. But her consolidation of voters seeking pre-Trump Republican normalcy and smiling electability should continue.

David French Neoconservatism made its comeback tonight, and Nikki Haley led the charge. She was hawkish on Iran, steadfast in supporting Israel, steadfast in supporting Ukraine and hawkish on China. Her message was clear: American weakness anywhere will be exploited by American enemies everywhere. She was also sensible and realistic on abortion. When the pro-life position is in electoral retreat, now is the wrong time to talk about national bans.

Sarah Isgur Expectations were high for Haley to keep moving toward a No. 2 position, and she met them, but not by much. Once again, she handled Ramaswamy easily. She also substantively had such strong answers that she looked like someone who could actually do the job of president. But nothing about her debate performance seems it would or could change the fact that she’s still lagging Trump by more than 30 points in Iowa.

Sarah Longwell She is at her best when demonstrating her foreign policy expertise (or swatting aside Ramaswamy). She falls flat when she’s delivering canned lines about her footwear. Her answer on abortion was thoughtful and seemed likely to connect with both primary and swing voters. There is a real chance she may overtake DeSantis as the main challenger to Trump.

Daniel McCarthy She may not be Dick Cheney in three-inch heels — they’re five inches, she joked — but neoconservatives like Ambassador Haley couldn’t handle Iraq or Afghanistan, so her bravado about taking on China and Russia sounds absurd.

Jamelle Bouie Ron DeSantis cannot escape the fact that it makes no real sense to try to run as a more competent Donald Trump, for the simple reason that the entire question of competence is orthogonal to Trump’s appeal. There’s not really much of an audience in the Republican primary electorate for what DeSantis is trying to sell, and it doesn’t help him that it seems he hates being a salesman of any sort.

Gail Collins So very, very hard to imagine him moving up to … anything.

Michelle Cottle He was extra feisty, which was mostly a positive. He even landed a lighthearted line about the profusion of Social Security recipients in his state. He did nothing, however, to distinguish himself — or to slow the momentum of Nikki Haley, who has been gradually creeping up on him.

Ross Douthat He basically took the same front-running, above-the-fray approach that he’s taken in every debate, notwithstanding a couple of mild digs at Haley here, and since he’s gained zero ground in the polls with that approach, it’s time to start reducing his scores even though he was perfectly fine overall.

David French This was DeSantis’s best debate, by far. He’s dropped the relentless focus on wokeism, he’s mostly revived his traditional Republican foreign policy views (though he was the weakest on Ukraine aid of anyone not named Vivek Ramaswamy), and he was generally substantive and calm. Just once, though, I’d like to see him debate without proposing a policy that violates the Constitution. Yet there he went again, proposing plainly unconstitutional summary executions for fentanyl smugglers at the border and bragging about violating the First Amendment rights of pro-Palestinian student groups on Florida campuses. Unconstitutional policymaking is a divisive waste of time, but that remains DeSantis’s signature move.

Sarah Isgur DeSantis was good, not great. His best moment was early in the debate, when he made the case against Trump — the strongest we’ve seen him make to date. Was it enough to turn the tide of this race? Nope. But it’s the only chance he’s got to make any headway in the remaining two months before Iowa.

Sarah Longwell DeSantis was looking to capitalize on his recent endorsement from Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa. This was his strongest debate performance. He was prepared and calm, but it wasn’t nearly enough to re-energize his flailing campaign. His affect remains charmless and grumpy.

Daniel McCarthy He still seems the most presidential, and he was sharp to include the Federal Reserve among his targets for censure. But his stature doesn’t grow as these debates continue, with more ideologically clear-cut candidates like Ambassador Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy driving the discussion.

Jamelle Bouie Chris Christie seems to know that he has no realistic chance of becoming the Republican nominee, which seems to have freed him to tether his bid for the White House to something that looks a little like reality. It’s not going to work, obviously, but it does make for a somewhat interesting show.

Gail Collins Really expected something more exciting than “reasonable,” but here we are.

Michelle Cottle He was a little lower energy than usual, especially early on. Not bad, but off his game. Not that it matters.

Ross Douthat It was a reminder of the rhetorical gifts that made him a strong potential president in 2016. Unfortunately, it’s 2023 — and all he’s doing is dividing the anti-Trump vote to no real purpose, for the sake of a fourth-place finish in New Hampshire.

David French Christie has been the boldest and most outspoken Trump critic in the field, and his relative silence about Donald Trump was indicative of a profound flaw that permeated the debate. In spite of the hosts’ efforts to get the candidates to distinguish themselves from the absent front-runner, they mostly acted as if Trump did not exist. When Christie isn’t running against Trump, one wonders why he runs at all.

Sarah Isgur It’s hard to watch Christie — who is always in his element on a debate stage — and not wonder what could have been if he had run in 2012. But 11 years later, it shows just how much the Republican Party has changed that Christie is viewed as more heretic than adherent.

Sarah Longwell Without an opportunity to confront Trump directly, Christie seems to have lost his reason for running. He deserves praise for his substantive, competent answers, but there’s not much of a market for that in the Republican primaries. Onstage, he is most helpful as an ally for Nikki Haley. But in the polling, they’re splitting the relatively small share of non-MAGA voters. Christie should drop out and endorse Haley.

Daniel McCarthy His reason for running was to thwart Trump. He hasn’t done that, and his presence isn’t achieving anything else, either.

Jamelle Bouie Watching Tim Scott make his appeal is like stepping into a time machine and walking into the 2000 Republican presidential contest. With his endorsement of the Laffer curve, Scott sounds like a relic. Unfortunately for him, there’s no real appetite for the zombie Reaganism he displayed.

Gail Collins He came in second for me, entirely on the theory that he’s trying to sound like a good, boring potential vice-presidential nominee. Of course, the boring part probably comes naturally to him.

Michelle Cottle Yet another meh performance, often flabby and rambling. So many words, so little clarity. It may be that he has been too long in the Senate.

Ross Douthat At the outset of the race, I thought he was a slightly more interesting candidate than Haley, but I’ve been proved wrong. Rhetorical gifts are no substitute for a compelling rationale for a candidacy, and after three debates, we’re no closer to answering the “Why Tim Scott?” question than we were at the start.

David French I’m not sure why Scott is still in the race. Everyone else on the stage has a niche. DeSantis is still Trump’s main challenger and an avatar for the new right. Haley has a small amount of momentum and represents the Reagan remnant. Christie attacks Trump. Ramaswamy appeals to Trump. But what is Scott doing? There is nothing distinctive about his candidacy, and there’s no obvious path for him to pass either DeSantis or Haley, much less Trump.

Sarah Isgur His answers were filled with platitudes and wannabe sound bites that seemed ill suited to the moment. Months and months into this campaign, he hasn’t gotten better, and it’s still unclear why he is running.

Sarah Longwell Tim Scott continues to barely register as a candidate. He engaged with questions only when they happened to align with his domestic policy chops. Otherwise, he fell back on stump speech anecdotes from his upbringing that were compelling the first 10 times we heard them. He clearly thinks that Iowa evangelicals will save his campaign. They won’t.

Daniel McCarthy He’s right to emphasize rebuilding U.S. industry as a strategic necessity, and his remarks on support for crisis pregnancy centers were spot on. But on most issues he’s marginal to the debate and the race.

Jamelle Bouie Is Vivek Ramaswamy the most singularly insufferable person in national politics?

Gail Collins If you’re gonna be the outspoken outsider, you have to be interesting as well as loud and irritating.

Michelle Cottle I had thought it was impossible for this guy to be any more puerile and obnoxious. I was so, so wrong. One word: decaf.

Ross Douthat Underneath all the attention seeking, trolling and performative obnoxiousness, there’s a guy making some interesting points that no other Republican is making. Underneath the guy making some interesting points, alas, there’s an attention-seeking troll.

David French Ramaswamy is a right-wing Twitter thread come to life. It’s actually uncanny how much he imitates the culture, positions and manners of right-wing Twitter trolls. But he was the only one who truly seemed to channel Trump’s antiwar positions, including Trump’s contempt for Ukraine. In a debate dominated by a neoconservative revival, Ramaswamy — in both style and substance — was the only Trumpist on the stage.

Sarah Isgur Per usual, he seemed to be running for most likely to get punched in the face. Still, this may have been his strongest debate performance to date. I’m sure a lot of G.O.P. primary voters relished his attacks on the Republican National Committee and the debate moderators.

Sarah Longwell As advertised: unhinged, unserious and unpleasant. Within an hour, he went from decrying antisemitism to calling Ukraine’s Jewish president a Nazi. He referred to Haley as “Dick Cheney in three-inch heels” and faulted her because her daughter uses TikTok. “Smarmy” isn’t a strong-enough word. His stunt campaign can’t end soon enough.

Daniel McCarthy He cheekily plays the Joker while the rest of the field pretends to be Batman, and in the process he punctures the platitudes that make these debates so dull and meaningless. Vive le villain!"
733,733,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/opinion/pence-trump-biden-2024.html,"It’s one thing to disparage Donald Trump. It’s quite another to throw your body between him and his efforts to steal the presidency. Mike Pence, God love him, did the latter, and that sealed his doom. To the hard-core MAGA corps, tyranny is the meaty breakfast of champions. Virtue and democracy are a wimp’s veggie canapés.

But that’s not the only moral of Pence’s miserable polling and early exit from the contest for the Republican presidential nomination, which is, incredibly, even less appetizing for his departure. He did something else that was just as dissonant with the mood of his party — with the mood of America, really. He talked about goodness. He privileged upbeat over downbeat. While others maniacally fanned the flames of anger, Pence mellowly stoked the embers of hope.

That’s not going to cut it in 2024. Pence’s fate validated that.

I’m braced for the campaign season from hell, for a race for the White House that’s a rhetorically violent duel of dystopias, a test of who can sound the shriller death knell for America. It could be all Armageddon all the time.

An exchange involving Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy in the Republican presidential debate last August in Milwaukee foreshadowed that. Pence took aim at his much younger rival’s perversely exuberant negativity, schooling him: “We’re not looking for a new national identity. The American people are the most faith-filled, freedom-loving, idealistic, hard-working people the world has ever known.” They just needed better leaders and a more responsive and responsible government."
734,734,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/23/arts/design/jewish-in-the-gdr-exhibition-berlin.html,"The catastrophic history of the Jews in Germany in the 1930s and ’40s is better known than the second half of the 20th century, Berg said. Before Adolf Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, there were more than half a million Jews in Germany, but during the first six years of the antisemitic Nazi regime, half fled to other countries. Among those who stayed, about 170,000 were murdered in the Holocaust. By the end of World War II, only about 15,000 Jews remained.

After the Third Reich was defeated in 1945, the Allies divided Germany into four occupied zones. Four years later, the British, French and American sectors became a parliamentary democracy, the Federal Republic of Germany, while the Soviet zone, led by a Marxist-Leninist party, became the G.D.R.

While few Jews wanted to live in Germany, or what they regarded as “the land of the perpetrators” in the war’s aftermath, denazification proceeded more quickly in the Soviet zone than in the West, and some Jews were attracted to the utopian vision of rebuilding a better society in the East, Lüdicke said: a “just, antifascist society, where being human was the most important value.”

The story of one such optimistic family is told through a traveling trunk owned by Josef and Lizzi Zimmering, painted with the cities that marked their trip back: “London, Brussels, Berlin.” After surviving the Holocaust in exile, they returned to the Soviet occupied zone in 1946. The trunk contained all of the family’s possessions after the war.

“It really stands for the optimism and hope — the exile and return — of people who believed in this utopia,” said Lewinsky."

My name is Ady Barkan, and I am speaking to you through this computer voice because I have been paralyzed by a mysterious illness called A.L.S. Like so many of you, I have experienced the ways our health care system is fundamentally broken: enormous costs, denied claims, dehumanizing treatment when we are most in need. Since my shocking diagnosis, I have traveled the country meeting countless patients like me, demanding more of our representatives in our democracy. Today we are witnessing the tragic consequences of our failing health care system. In the midst of a pandemic, nearly 100 million Americans do not have sufficient health insurance, and even good insurance does not cover essential needs like long term care. Our loved ones are dying in unsafe nursing homes, our nurses are overwhelmed and unprotected, and our essential workers are treated as dispensable. We live in the richest country in history, and yet we do not guarantee this most basic human right. Everyone living in America should get the health care they need, regardless of their employment status or ability to pay. Even during this terrible crisis, Donald Trump and Republican politicians are trying to take away millions of people’s health insurance. With the existential threat of another four years of this president, we all have a profound obligation to act — not only to vote, but to make sure that our friends, family and neighbors vote as well. We must elect Joe Biden. Each of us must be a hero for our communities, for our country. And then, with a compassionate and intelligent president, we must act together and put on his desk a bill that guarantees us all the health care we deserve."

“For people interested in seeing the photographic arts in all of its varied forms and styles, Viewpoint is a great place to visit. Its free monthly, changing exhibits in two gallery spaces will showcase landscape, portraiture, street, still life, abstract, alternative processes, composites and mixed media from artists around the world. Every new exhibit will have a reception to allow you to talk to the artists directly. You can also browse the portfolio drawers of local artists to see additional photographic works.

737,737,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/arts/design/picasso-sothebys-emily-fisher-landau-auction.html,"A brilliant blue painting by Pablo Picasso of his young mistress was crowned the prized lot of the November auction season so far after it sold at Sotheby’s in New York for $139.4 million, with buyer’s fees, on Wednesday.

Completed during one of the most intense years of the artist’s personal life, the 1932 portrait of Picasso’s great muse, Marie-Thérèse Walter, remained on the auction block for four minutes as three collectors over the phones from around the world fought to establish control. But it was an anonymous bidder who named the winning price over the telephone. (The work fell short of the $179.4 million auction high for the artist, established at Christie’s in 2015.)

The evening sale of blue-chip modern and contemporary art from the estate of Emily Fisher Landau, an arts patron who had her own private museum in Long Island City, Queens, was somewhat protected from market volatility because Sotheby’s had assured the owners that it would purchase the Picasso — and nearly 30 other consignments from the estate — if buyers failed to bid above a minimum price. Auctioneers said that over recent weeks they were in a frenzy to secure third-party guarantees that were slightly higher, saving their company from assuming debt on the trove of artworks.

“When it’s hard to compel someone to sell something, you need to put money on the table,” said Benjamin Godsill, an art adviser watching the sale. “The headline for me is keep calm and carry on. There is still a market, even if there weren’t fireworks.”"
738,738,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/04/opinion/sunday/china-nuclear-weapons-russia.html,"After months of troubled relations, and then some tentative steps to bridge the gap between the United States and China, there is one glaring omission: American and Chinese military leaders still don’t communicate with one another directly. That’s important because those lines of communication are the best way to avoid the kind of misunderstandings or overreactions that can lead to actual conflict. That’s why it’s encouraging that the countries plan to meet on Monday to discuss arms control.

The talks come at a perilous moment for the systems of global controls, painstakingly built over decades, to avoid nuclear conflict. The landmark Cold War-era treaties between the United States and Russia have fallen by the wayside, one by one, with few meaningful restraints remaining and even less good will to negotiate successor agreements. The last major agreement, New START, expires in February 2026.

This week, the Russian government said it was formally withdrawing from the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, though it said it would continue to abide by the terms of that agreement. The United States, for its part, is in the midst of upgrading its own nuclear weapons.

As the United States and Russia lose their safeguards, the Chinese government is expanding its nuclear arsenal. For decades, the People’s Liberation Army has felt secure with a few hundred nuclear weapons. But over the past few years, the government began a building spree that, if it continues, would leave China with an arsenal of 1,500 nuclear weapons by 2035, according to an estimate released last month by the Pentagon. Currently, the United States and Russia have about 1,670 deployed weapons each, with thousands more in storage."
739,739,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/13/us/hollywood-actors-contract-vote.html,"For the past several months, production in Hollywood has been at a near standstill.

In May, thousands of movie and television writers went on strike, calling for better pay amid an explosion of streaming services that have upended the entertainment industry. In July, 160,000 actors joined the action — the first time that Hollywood writers and actors went on strike at the same time since 1960.

The Writers Guild of America, which represents 11,500 screenwriters, ended its 148-day strike in September after reaching an agreement with studios.

And last week, SAG-AFTRA, the union representing tens of thousands of actors, reached a tentative deal for a new contract with entertainment companies. That ends what was the longest movie and television strike in the union’s 90-year history and clears the way for the $134 billion U.S. movie and television business to swing back into business.

SAG-AFTRA said on Friday that its national board had voted to send a tentative contract with studios to members for ratification, a process that would start tomorrow and end the first week in December."
740,740,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/briefing/gaza-women-russia-ukraine-openai.html,"The nightmare of giving birth in Gaza

The streets were empty. The ambulance couldn’t come for more than half an hour, and the hospital’s maternity ward no longer functioned. The only sounds were the noises of planes and shelling.

For Wajiha al-Abyad, who had fled her home weeks earlier, giving birth in Gaza last month was “something like a horror film,” she said.

Women, children and newborns in Gaza are disproportionately bearing the burden of the war, both as casualties and in reduced access to health care services. The U.N. estimates that there are around 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza and that more than 160 babies are delivered every day.

The bombardment, huge levels of displacement, collapsing water and electricity supplies and limited access to food and medicine are severely disrupting maternal, newborn and child health care. None of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are functional enough to treat critical trauma cases or perform surgery, the W.H.O. said."
741,741,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/books/review/childrens-lit-taboos.html,"The issue, then, is the extent to which publishers feel the need to pander to the limitations any one group might impose, particularly in such an uncommonly politicized children’s book culture. If you are in a high-risk, small-margin business like publishing, with a constant eye on the bottom line, why allow a small, inconsequential detail — a character in a crowded street scene holding a cigarette — to alienate 48 percent of your potential market? Surely it’s easier to pre-emptively avoid all the possibly problematic things. Just in case.

We translators are stationed permanently at bridging points between different book markets operating under different rules, which feels like a good position from which to interrogate them. We’re always grappling with the fact that what might be widely accepted in one market will be controversial in another. Seen from Nordic countries, say, Anglophone markets can look prudish when it comes to sex, sexuality and human bodies, and in total denial when it comes to death.

Context isn’t irrelevant, of course. Genuine harms exist, and threats to children’s safety aren’t the same everywhere. An episode of “Peppa Pig” in which Peppa learns to befriend a spider was, sensibly, pulled from transmission in Australia, home to some of the more ferociously unfriendly arachnid species.

One common sticking point is that what differs from market to market is, fundamentally, the concept of children and childhood: What is expected of and for children? How much agency should they have? How much do adults trust in their general robustness in the face of The World? Woodstein recalls being asked by publishers to alter words or scenes to avoid suggesting that child characters have “too much liberty.”

Unlike some publishers, Enchanted Lion is constantly working to “expand the field of possibility,” as Bedrick puts it. One of my favorites from their wide-ranging catalog is “The Bird Coat,” by Inger Marie Kjolstadmyr and Oyvind Torseter, translated from Norwegian by Kari Dickson. It’s a beautiful, thought-provoking book about a tailor who aspires to fly and bravely jumps … to his death. It’s a book about courage, consequences and failure; about following a dream. People love books about dreamers, Bedrick says, but only when the dreamers succeed. It’s not the first time she has encountered U.S. resistance to kids’ books without conventionally happy endings.

I don’t expect one culture’s discomforts to be inflicted on another. Just because Australia has some highly venomous spiders doesn’t mean the rest of us have to be continually fretting about them. In practice, sure, minor accommodations often need to be made (if I want my books to span multiple markets, best to keep witches and pigs out of the pictures). But what Schimel experienced in Hungary — and what plenty of authors experience in parts of the United States — is about assuming that one’s own taboos are, or should be, our neighbors’. This looks particularly willful and arbitrary to those of us who are trying to reconcile divergent cultures that assume theirs is the only way."
742,742,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/us/politics/government-shutdown-vote-mike-johnson.html,"Speaker Mike Johnson was forced on Tuesday to rely on Democratic votes as the House passed legislation to keep federal funding flowing into early 2024, after scores of Republicans opposed his plan to avert a government shutdown at the end of the week.

Almost all Democrats and a majority of Republicans overcame the opposition of G.O.P. conservatives to approve the bill under special expedited procedures that required a supermajority. That approach, hatched by Mr. Johnson in his first weeks as speaker, amounted to a gamble that a substantial number of Democrats would rally to help pass a package that Mr. Johnson’s own members were unwilling to back.

The vote was 336 to 95, easily clearing the two-thirds threshold required for passage. In the end, 209 Democrats and 127 Republicans joined to pass the bill. Ninety-three Republicans opposed it, as did two Democrats.

The final tally vividly reflected a dynamic that dogged both Mr. Johnson and his predecessor, Speaker Kevin McCarthy: The House G.O.P. lacks the political will to keep the government funded, forcing its leaders, operating with only a tiny majority, to rely on Democratic votes to do so or face the political backlash for a shutdown."

Eataly SoHo

This, the third Eataly in Manhattan, the ninth in the United States and the 49th worldwide, is more restaurant than food market. About half the 20,000-square-foot space, smaller than the Eataly locations in the Flatiron and financial districts, is taken up by a 200-seat dining room and bar, generously windowed, with a brick wall and a bar done in natural wood. Just past the restaurant is the cafe, a casual all-day coffee bar with tables serving pastries, breakfast fare and other light food like Roman-style pizza alla pala. Unlike the usual Eataly template, there are no dining counters in the retail food departments like the pizzeria or butcher. The restaurant’s wine list and menu are thoroughly Italian, with beef carpaccio, cold seafood salad, radicchio salad, tagliatelle Bolognese, rigatoni carbonara, lasagna with mushroom ragù and various pizzas. The market side of the establishment sells groceries like sauces, oils, pastas and condiments, including some newly anointed with Eataly’s private label. Fresh food like produce, meats, seafood, cheeses and charcuterie is all prepackaged. Tommaso Brusò, the new chief executive of Eataly North America, said another 20 Eatalys are planned for North America in the next five years. And while they’re at it, they will also be expanding the Flatiron district store next spring. (Opens Nov. 25)

HAAM

Formerly takeout-only and based in Sunnyside, Queens, this plant-based Caribbean spot has become a proper restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It’s by the chef and owner Yesenia Ramdass, whose cooking is inspired by her family’s Dominican heritage and the Trinidadian background of her husband, Randy Ramdass. There are 30 seats and six bar perches in the space, which is done with straw and green for an island feel. The menu showcases jerk barbecued mushrooms in a yellow rice ball, mashed yucca with king oyster mushroom “scallops,” a sweet plantain boat stuffed with lentils and cabbage slaw, Yuh Motha’s mofongo with lion’s mane mushrooms and cream sauce and arroz con leche rice pudding made with cashew milk. There’s takeout and delivery. (Wednesday)

John McDonald has joined forces with Stephen Hanson, another restaurateur, to open this minimalist burger stall in an Urbanspace food hall. The menu offers but two choices: the Classic, like the one you’d have found at Mr. McDonald’s Burger & Barrel, now closed, with cheese, lettuce and tomato; and the Bash Burger, also a four-ounce patty with the addition of bacon, onion jam and shaved pickles, and so named because it has repeatedly taken first place in the New York City Wine & Food festival’s burger bash contest. Fries, fountain drinks, beer, wine and cocktails are served.

Many of the most rampant crimes in San Francisco involve automobiles. A person is severely injured in a car crash on city streets every 15 hours. Car break-ins, often perpetrated by thieves who are in idling cars themselves, have swelled since 2011; nearly 17,000 have been reported this year.

A newer crime that the police call “ram raiding” involves driving a car into a storefront window, filling the vehicle with stolen goods and speeding away. Car thefts and sideshows are also common."

“Isn’t it also a violation of human rights in a different way?” she said, referring to the U.S. decision to suspend Uganda from the program.

Once the suspensions take effect on Jan. 1, there will be 31 countries participating in the trade program. It was signed into law in 2000 and is open to nations in sub-Saharan Africa, allowing them to export certain goods to the U.S. without having to pay duties. Last year, the U.S. took in about $30 billion worth of goods through AGOA.

The tension between promoting democracy and human rights, on one hand, and maintaining influence abroad is hardly a new one for the U.S. It is very much alive in Africa today with the competition between the U.S., Russia and China, where Moscow and Beijing promise aid and security without strings. But for the U.S., the campaign to promote democracy is, among other things, an essential selling point for a domestic audience that has grown increasingly isolationist in recent years."
746,746,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/opinion/tipping-percent-door-dash.html,"This year, DoorDash, which delivers takeout food from restaurants, piloted a warning on its app that if customers don’t add a tip at the time they order, “their order may take longer to be accepted as a result.” The randomly tested warning has served its purpose because nobody wants cold food: “Since launching this test, we’ve seen a meaningful decrease in no-tip orders,” the company announced on Nov. 1. (If a no-tip order sits too long, DoorDash will raise the base pay until a driver — known as a Dasher — finally picks it up.)

I’m glad to see workers earning more in jobs that tend to be low-paid, grueling and in some cases dangerous. That’s sharing the wealth. “Our three-sided marketplace only works if it’s working for Dashers, consumers and merchants alike,” the company said, correctly.

I’m not as happy that some portion of the bigger tips will most likely indirectly increase corporate profits. DoorDash, for example, says that the independent contractors who drive for it get to keep all of their tips, and the company doesn’t reduce their base pay if they’re tipped. While that’s true, money is fungible. You have to assume that if the drivers have started to consistently earn more in tips, over the long run the company will be able to offer less in base pay than it otherwise would have.

The technology-aided shift in the balance of power isn’t just about tips. It’s about the broader question of who’s trying to please whom. For example, Uber allows drivers to rate their passengers. A passenger rated with a single star will have a hard time getting picked up by a driver, so there’s a strong incentive to be on one’s best behavior. (The driver rates the passenger before seeing the tip, although I’m guessing a lot of customers don’t realize that.)

Tipping intrigues economists because in some ways it seems irrational. Why leave a tip at a restaurant in a city that you will never visit again? Maybe you’re trying to impress your dining companion with your generosity. But what if you’re dining alone? Robert Frank, a Cornell economist, wrote in a 1988 book, “Passions Within Reason: The Strategic Role of the Emotions,” that people develop altruistic habits because getting a reputation for doing the right thing (even when no one is looking) helps them succeed in the long run."

On Sept. 1, 1969, a group of Libyan Army men launched a haphazard but ultimately successful coup that toppled the country’s monarch, King Idris I, and put them in charge of the large oil-rich nation on the Mediterranean coast. Taking to the airwaves, their leader, a little-known officer in his late 20s named Muammar el-Qaddafi, announced the dawn of a new era in a country where “all will be free, brothers within a society in which — with God’s help — prosperity and equality will be seen to rule us all.”

The putschists — a group of officers who had never run even a desert oasis — soon realized that they had no idea how to govern a country, so they sent a cable to their hero and role model, Gamal Abdel Nasser, the president of Egypt and one of the most prominent Arabs of his day, to ask for help.

And help he did. He sent arms, military experts and advice on how to talk to the West. He encouraged the officers to assure the United States, Britain and France that the coup posed no risk to their people or interests. He appeared publicly with Colonel el-Qaddafi to boost the rising young dictator’s international standing and dispatched an aide to advise him on everything he needed to know, like the importance of hiring a trustworthy cook to avoid getting poisoned. (“If you don’t succeed and secure this revolution,” Nasser reportedly told the aide, “I’ll kill you with my own hands.”)

Colonel el-Qaddafi went on to rule Libya for 42 years, brutalizing his people, failing to develop his nation, sponsoring acts of terrorism and aging into a cartoonish thug who appeared at international forums like the United Nations General Assembly dressed in flowing robes and ranting like a kook. His long reign is but one strand of Nasser’s disastrous legacy, according to “We Are Your Soldiers,” by the Lebanon-based journalist Alex Rowell. Rowell takes the reader on a historical tour of the Middle East to illuminate how Nasser contributed to the region’s “shared curse of political repression mixed with economic misery.”"
748,748,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/business/x-elon-musk-advertisers.html,"X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter, could lose as much as $75 million in advertising revenue by the end of the year as dozens of major brands pause their marketing campaigns after its owner, Elon Musk, endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory this month.

Internal documents viewed by The New York Times this week show that the company is in a more difficult position than previously known and that concerns about Mr. Musk and the platform have spread far beyond companies including IBM, Apple and Disney, which paused their advertising campaigns on X last week. The documents list more than 200 ad units of companies from the likes of Airbnb, Amazon, Coca-Cola and Microsoft, many of which have halted or are considering pausing their ads on the social network.

The documents come from X’s sales team and are meant to track the impact of all the advertising lapses this month, including those by companies that have already paused and others that may be at risk of doing so. They list how much ad revenue X employees fear the company could lose through the end of the year if advertisers do not return.

On Friday, X said in a statement that $11 million in revenue was at risk and that the exact figure fluctuated as some advertisers returned to the platform and others increased spending. The company said the numbers viewed by The Times were either outdated or represented an internal exercise to evaluate total risk.

The advertising freezes come during the final three months of the year, which is traditionally the social media company’s strongest quarter as brands run holiday promotions for events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In the last three months of 2021 — the last year the company reported fourth-quarter earnings before Mr. Musk took over — the company recorded $1.57 billion in revenue, of which nearly 90 percent came from advertising.

Since Mr. Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of Twitter last year, some brands have been hesitant to advertise on the platform, concerned with Mr. Musk’s behavior and content moderation decisions, which have led to a rise in incendiary and hateful content. U.S. advertising on the platform is down nearly 60 percent this year, prompting the company to try to woo back advertisers in an effort its chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, is spearheading. X is also campaigning for advertisers to return during the holiday period to make up for revenue shortfalls earlier in the year.

The documents, however, reveal that has not been going to plan. More than 100 brands are shown as having “fully paused” their ads while dozens of others are listed as “at risk.” Many paused on or after Nov. 15, when Mr. Musk wrote in a post on X that the conspiracy theory that Jews supported the immigration of minorities to replace white populations was “the actual truth.”

Leesha Anderson, the vice president of digital marketing and social media at the advertising agency Outcast, said its clients steadily stopped spending on X after Mr. Musk took over and had found alternatives on platforms like LinkedIn and TikTok.

“In today’s dynamic marketplace, brands have a plethora of platform choices at their disposal for precise audience targeting,” she said. “Therefore, it is imperative for the stewards and proprietors of social platforms to exercise deliberate discretion in all aspects, be it their personal beliefs or political stances, as these choices will inevitably undergo public scrutiny.”

The organizations that have paused their ads on X range from political campaigns to fast food chains to tech giants, according to the documents. Airbnb, for example, halted more than $1 million of advertising, while Uber cut back on ads worth more than $800,000, halting campaigns in U.S. and international markets. Both tech companies declined to comment.

Other large brands, including Jack in the Box, Coca-Cola and Netflix, paused some of their campaigns. Netflix’s halted ads were worth nearly $3 million, according to X’s estimates. Jack in the Box, Coca-Cola and Netflix did not respond to requests for comment.

Various subsidiaries of Microsoft have also stopped advertising — leading to a potential loss of more than $4 million in revenue for X’s fourth quarter, based on the documents — as have Amazon’s units for books and music and one subsidiary of Google. The search giant and some other brands that have paused spending, including NBC Universal, have continued to post content on the platform without paying X to ensure it reaches a broad audience.

Google and Microsoft declined to comment. Amazon did not return requests for comment.

On the NBC program “Meet the Press” last Sunday, the Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie called Mr. Musk’s comment part of a recent outpouring of an “outrageous type of hate.”

“Whether it’s Elon Musk, whether it’s professors on our college campuses or students that they are misleading, or whether it’s individuals who are speaking out in an antisemitic way on the streets of our cities,” he said.

Two days before Mr. Christie’s appearance, a super PAC supporting him, called Tell It Like It Is, pulled its advertising from X, according to the documents. A representative for the political fund-raising group did not respond to a request for comment.

In an internal meeting with employees at X this week, Ms. Yaccarino cut a defiant mood. She made no mention of Mr. Musk’s endorsement of the antisemitic post and attributed the company’s problems to a report by the left-wing media watchdog group Media Matters, which showed that ads on X from companies like IBM and Apple appeared next to posts promoting white nationalist and Nazi content.

On Monday, after Mr. Musk called Media Matters “an evil organization,” X sued the group and argued that its report, which was published after Mr. Musk’s statement, “manipulated the algorithms governing the user experience on X to bypass safeguards and create images of X’s largest advertisers’ paid posts adjacent to racist, incendiary content.” Ms. Yaccarino has blamed the Media Matters report for X’s declining ad sales.

“Kowtowing to external criticism or pressures is simply not how X will ever operate,” she wrote in an email to X employees on Wednesday that was seen by The Times. “The people at X are free speech defenders. We stand in solidarity with those who believe in this fundamental right and the critical checks and balances of a thriving democracy.”

Earlier this week, Mr. Musk spent time celebrating companies that have continued to advertise on X, including the National Football League. Using a heart emoji, X’s billionaire owner said he loved the N.F.L. (The New York Times largely stopped marketing on the platform in early 2023, though the company’s sports publication, The Athletic, has continued to purchase ads, according to a spokesman.)

Mr. Musk also noted that the company would donate “all revenue from advertising & subscriptions associated with the war in Gaza to hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza.” The funding will include revenue from ads bought by charity groups, news organizations and other groups that advertised content related to the conflict.

Following her boss, Ms. Yaccarino added to Mr. Musk’s original post with a plea.

“Lean in and help,” she wrote on X.

Its operations along the roughly 600-mile-long trench line have failed to produce any advances, while resulting in high casualties on both sides, and Ukraine is facing intensified Russian attacks in the East. At the same time, skepticism about Ukraine aid has increased in some European capitals and among members of the Republican Party in the United States.

Ukraine’s leadership is also worried that the attention of Western allies has shifted to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, and away from its war with Russia. “The war in the Middle East, this conflict takes away the focus,” Mr. Zelensky said on Saturday.

Even as Ukrainian soldiers endure in the trenches, soaked now into streams of mud by autumn rains, officials and politicians in Ukraine and allied capitals have been passing around blame for the stalled Ukrainian counteroffensive that began in June and has advanced only a dozen or so miles through densely mined fields. American officials have hinted that Ukraine was to blame for dispersing its forces too widely; Mr. Zelensky said his army did not receive sufficient weaponry to advance.

Speculation about tension between the president and the military’s commanding general over strategy and command appointments had been swirling in Kyiv for more than a year but had not spilled into public disagreement previously."

Mr. Chernyak declined to speculate on the perpetrator or the type of poison used and provided no further details, citing the ongoing investigation.

Personally, I’m skeptical the final results will look quite like these polls. But even if you think the final results will be very different, it does not mean that the polls are “wrong” today.

In fact, the belief that Mr. Biden will ultimately win young voters handily next year does nothing to distinguish two very different explanations for what we see in the polling:

The polls are mostly wrong. They’re biased. For whatever reason, they fail to reach the Democratic-leaning young voters who propelled Mr. Biden to victory in 2020.

The polls are mostly right. They’re reaching the young voters who backed Mr. Biden. But for now, these voters don’t support him. Over the next year, things could change.

When it comes to the Times/Siena poll, we’ve put forward a lot of evidence consistent with the theory that the polling is mostly right, but that things might change.

By the measures at our disposal, the voters 18 to 29 in our survey “look” right. They say they backed Mr. Biden over Mr. Trump in the last presidential election by a wide margin, 57-35, right in line with our expectations. They “look” right by other measures of partisanship as well. In the states with party registration, for instance, the Times/Siena young voters were registered Democrats by a 13-point margin, 35 percent to 22 percent. That’s almost exactly in line with their actual 13-point registration advantage, 36 percent to 23 percent.

It’s important to emphasize that just because the polls “look” right doesn’t mean they are right. Our polls looked “right” by these kind of indicators in 2020. They were still wrong in important ways (though they were right about plenty as well, including racial and generational depolarization). But these data points nonetheless raise the burden on those who assert that the issue is partisan nonresponse bias, in which young Democrats simply aren’t answering their cellphones (99.8 percent of our young respondents were reached by cellphone).

We see no evidence of that. In our polling, the problem for Mr. Biden isn’t too few young Democrats. It’s that many young Democrats don’t like him. Mr. Biden has just a 76-20 lead among young voters either registered as Democrats or who have previously voted in a Democratic primary. It’s just a 69-24 lead among young nonwhite Democrats. The dissent exists among self-identified Democrats, Democratic-leaners, Biden ’20 voters, and so on."

The centerpiece of that plan was a promise for an injection of 100 billion euros, or nearly $110 billion, and to raise military spending in a shift that amounted to an earthquake for a country that had developed an almost pacifist ethos since its terrible history in World War II.

But nearly two years later, experts and military officers say the “Zeitenwende,” or “change of era,” Mr. Scholz promised with such fanfare is barely visible to rank-and-file soldiers who still lack even the most ordinary infrastructure, ammunition and equipment.

Much of the money has either not yet materialized or is going to weapons that will not be in the hands of soldiers for years because of procurement delays and the need to ramp up long-dormant production lines."
753,753,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/opinion/george-santos-republican-party.html,"By now, you probably know a lot about George Santos, the congressman who scammed with abandon and made up almost everything. His college diploma. His grandparents who “survived” the Holocaust. Many of his most egregious untruths were unveiled by The New York Times last December. This week, the House Ethics Committee went even further, reporting that he had used campaign money for Atlantic City trips and things marked “Botox.”

This most recent round of investigative revelations prompted Mr. Santos to say he won’t run for re-election, as his fellow House members try once again to expel him. But the fact that he remains in Congress highlights something crucial about the people’s House. It’s a Congress that this week featured a former speaker being accused of playing a sharp-elbowed bully and a senator getting ready for Mortal Kombat with the Teamsters president. Even in that company, Mr. Santos stands out by exposing just how much craziness the Republican Party is willing to tolerate in pursuit of narrow partisan gains.

The biographical lies and widely reported small-time hustles that boosted Mr. Santos pale in comparison with his penchant for “just throwing ideas.”

I’m borrowing that phrase directly from Mr. Santos, who said it in a Spaces conversation on X, formerly Twitter, in October, shortly after Hamas’s terrorist attack on Israel. After saying that the ambush made him worried about “the kind of danger that we’re in on a national security front,” he started freestyling ways for the United States not to get “caught sleeping,” as happened before Sept. 11. Maybe we should take a close look at people who waved Palestinian flags at a protest — he thought there was “probable cause” to check them out. Or perhaps federal agents should be vetting people more broadly: “I think every inch of this country at this point should be mapped out again and completely checked,” he said, without getting into specifics. “I don’t care if we go into a police state for a couple of months.”"

She had greater ambitions than simply throwing state dinners, she explained, and she paved the way for a new, more enduring view of how a presidential spouse could make a difference. “The first lady role has changed,” she observed. “I don’t think there will ever be another first lady who will be just a hostess and pour tea.”

If that is true, Mrs. Carter will have been one of the primary reasons.

While she spent only four years in the White House, she transformed the unelected, unpaid and sometimes unappreciated position of first lady in ways that reverberate to this day. By the time she died at age 96 on Sunday at her home in Plains, Ga., she had long since dropped out of public view, but every one of her successors knew how important she was in shaping the role they inherited.

“We have Rosalynn Carter to thank for helping to expand and formalize the modern first lady’s office, a structure that is largely still in place to this day,” said Anita B. McBride, who served as chief of staff to Laura Bush when she was first lady — a staff job that itself has its origins in Mrs. Carter’s era. “It was a time in the country of profound change for women, and she wanted to seize the opportunities before her.”"

The court’s unanimous rejection of a flagship government policy is the latest setback for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at a time of intense political turmoil in the Conservative Party, which has held power for 13 years and is lagging in the polls.

Reacted to the war in Israel and Gaza, including protesting a tech conference organizer’s social media posts about the conflict.

Buzzed over a manifesto from a top venture capitalist outlining a list of enemies to technological progress.

Scrambled to invest money in the hottest artificial intelligence company, OpenAI, at triple its valuation earlier this year.

Hotly debated the new features on Threads, a social media site owned by Meta.

All of which is to say that, despite the involvement of many Silicon Valley insiders in FTX, people in tech were not outwardly obsessed over the ins and outs of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s trial, which ended when he was found guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy on Thursday. They barely mustered a shrug.

The apathy may have had many reasons, including that FTX’s downfall has been well covered by two books, a documentary and multiple podcasts in the year since it happened. But a simpler answer could be that the tech industry has again done what it does best: move on to the next thing.

The industry hasn’t fixated on Mr. Bankman-Fried’s fate because it is no longer fixated on crypto — or web3, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs and other crypto-fied buzzwords that signified the cutting edge just two years ago. They may come back around in a few years. But for now, they are out of style and therefore irrelevant.

In early 2009, congressional Republicans were staring down a long exile in the political wilderness. Barack Obama was about to assume the presidency, and Democrats were within reach of a filibuster-proof, 60-vote supermajority in the Senate and the largest House majority in more than 20 years after the economic crisis of 2008.

But Republicans saw a glimmer of hope in the energized far-right populist movement that emerged out of a backlash to Mr. Obama — the first Black president — and his party’s aggressive economic and social agenda, which included a federal health care plan. Republicans seized on the Tea Party and associated groups, with their nativist leanings and vehemently anti-establishment impulses, as their ticket back to power.

“That’s what I’m trying to do,” Wegz, 25, said. “Just revert people back to minimalism.”

His numbers, however, have been growing. Wegz has been the most-streamed artist on Spotify in Egypt since 2020. In 2022, he was named the most-streamed artist on the platform across the entire Middle East and North Africa, and became the first Egyptian artist to perform at the FIFA World Cup final. He sold out concerts in London and Berlin before arriving in the United States last month as the first Arab artist with a global tour backed by the concert giant Live Nation.

(Wegz’s track “El Bakht” is now the most streamed song of all time on the service.) “As an Arabic hip-hop movement, he has taken it to a different scale.”

In the middle of his current tour — after the European leg had wrapped up but before his first dates in North America — the war between Israel and Hamas began.

Fox’s character, Marty McFly, is transported to the fall of 2015 and encounters a world of self-tying shoes and hoverboards. He finds himself trying to make sense of how people behave and the choices they make.

Lately, I too feel like I’ve been transported to autumn 2015.

That fall, Republican Party officials, donors and operatives were brimming with hope that the field of presidential contenders facing Donald Trump would shrink, clearing the way for a one-on-one matchup between the then-unthinkable Mr. Trump and a more conventional nominee, like the senators Ted Cruz of Texas or Marco Rubio of Florida. As one Michigan donor put it, “Just like everyone else, I’m waiting for this field to consolidate, and it doesn’t seem to be consolidating.” Arguments ensued over which candidates should take the hint. If only the field were smaller, the thinking went, surely Mr. Trump would be defeated.

If only, if only, if only. This line of thinking became an excuse for candidates who didn’t want to take any real swings at Mr. Trump. It was the field — not Mr. Trump — that was the problem. No top contender took him on aggressively. No one really hammered away at his weaknesses in the kind of sustained, nimble assault they would have needed to topple him from his position as the front-runner. And even as Mr. Trump’s opponents dropped out, some of their voters wound up drifting to Mr. Trump as a second choice, keeping him at the head of the pack.

Something similar is happening today. From the Republican debates to the campaign trail, the other candidates aren’t making a real attempt to dent the front-runner’s lead; instead, they are sniping at one another, pleading with donors and engaging in magical thinking. While there is some truth that having more candidates helps Mr. Trump win the nomination, consolidating the field alone is not likely sufficient to defeat him."

It is the most candid assessment so far by a leading Ukrainian official of the military’s stalled counteroffensive.

“Just like in the First World War we have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate,” the commander, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, told The Economist in an interview published on Wednesday. “There will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough.”

His comments marked the first time a top Ukrainian commander said the fighting had reached an impasse, although General Zaluzhny added that breaking the deadlock could require technological advances to achieve air superiority and increase the effectiveness of artillery fire. He added that Russian forces, too, are incapable of advancing.

The general said modern technology and precision weapons on both sides were preventing troops from breaching enemy lines, including the expansive use of drones, and the ability to jam drones. He called for advances in electronic warfare as a way to break the deadlock."

Several countries — including Germany, Britain and Norway — are increasing production of weapons, especially the artillery ammunition that Ukraine so badly needs. Germany, once a laggard in providing aid to Ukraine, announced a week ago that it planned to double its support to $8.5 billion in 2024 and would deliver more crucial air-defense systems by the end of this year. And European Union states are gearing up to train an additional 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers, bringing the total so far to 40,000.

“We really have to step up our game here,” Kajsa Ollongren, the Dutch defense minister, said at a forum this month at the Clingendael Institute, a think tank funded by the Dutch government.

But that may be little comfort to Ukraine, where a counteroffensive against invading Russian forces has stalled as winter approaches, and officials say more support is needed now, even as many countries turn their attention to the Israel-Gaza war."

The choice of Westermann, 61, to replace Richard Armstrong, who retired as director last summer, is something of a surprise, given that she is not a professional museum director and her name doesn’t typically appear on the list of candidates.

But she is familiar to many in the art world, having previously served as executive vice president at the Andrew W.

With less than a thousand votes to spare, Kristy Marmorato, a conservative Republican candidate, was declared the winner by The Associated Press of the tightest City Council contest in the city, roughly 15 hours after the polls had closed.

Ms. Marmorato had sparred with Ms. Velázquez about crime and her support of a rezoning that would bring affordable housing to the neighborhood in District 13 in the northeast Bronx.

The plans would sharply restrict both legal and illegal immigration in a multitude of ways.

Mr. Trump wants to revive his first-term border policies, including banning entry by people from certain Muslim-majority nations and reimposing a Covid 19-era policy of refusing asylum claims — though this time he would base that refusal on assertions that migrants carry other infectious diseases like tuberculosis.

He plans to scour the country for unauthorized immigrants and deport people by the millions per year.

To help speed mass deportations, Mr. Trump is preparing an enormous expansion of a form of removal that does not require due process hearings.

Late ’70s press coverage mocked her as “Rosé Rosalynn,” a dour Southern Baptist who canceled hard liquor, dancing and French cooking at White House dinners — all seen as not elegant or remnants of Kennedy-era decadence — and allowed her staff members to shuffle around in clogs. Feminists like Gloria Steinem faulted Mrs. Carter for not being sufficiently outré in her activism. “I am disappointed in her altogether,” complained Ms. Steinem in 1978. Even female reporters like United Press International’s Helen Thomas, an old White House hand who had witnessed far lazier and media-hostile first ladies, were unimpressed. “There’s no ferment, no mystique,” she wrote. “She creates neither love nor hate.”

Neither America nor Washington was quite ready for Mrs. Carter at the time. A careless classism and Georgetown-set pettiness ran through much of the D.C.-focused society gossip and political reporting about her. (Nancy Reagan was careful to cultivate the Katharine Graham-led Washington social elite to pre-empt the same fate.)

While Mrs. Carter was less contemptuous of politics than her husband and strategic enough to know that lofty goals required politicking, she, too, came from a small town in Georgia and had a slightly defensive air of humble superiority. It kept her from doing the image crafting and social brokering that first ladyhood requires. It was only a political outsider like Andy Warhol, who visited the Carters in Plains, Ga., to do a portrait of Mr. Carter after he won the Democratic nomination, who could appreciate her steel. “She’s the tough one, Rosalynn,” he told a colleague after the trip. “She wears the pantsuit. Polyester.”

Less Washington-centric press accounts from Mrs. Carter’s time in office acknowledged what she had managed to achieve but with an undercurrent of ambivalence. A Newsweek columnist referred to her as “Mrs. President”; on the occasion of one speech, a piece in The Atlantic described her as having “the air of a child at her first piano recital.” It was only years later that mental health would emerge as a national health crisis, and by that time Mrs. Carter’s early efforts to both forge a care agenda and combat stigma were largely forgotten. The legacy of the Carter administration itself was neglected for decades and only recently has generated renewed interest.

My own interest in Rosalynn Carter was piqued in childhood, when in Iranian émigré circles her husband was blamed for haranguing the shah of Iran on his human rights record, emboldening the anti-shah Iranian student movement in the United States and thus shepherding that great disaster, the Iranian revolution of 1979. In my mind, the name Jimmy Carter, pronounced in a Persian accent, still sounds like a curse word."

That’s New York’s problem, although New York has been taking steps to improve its sewer system.

In Hoboken, the sewers were upgraded, and many of the streets were remade so there would be less likelihood of pedestrian accidents. But Hoboken’s approach was to do a twofer: At the same time, it put in gardens and porous surfaces along those streets that would collect water when there was rain.

You pointed out that Mayor Adams cut $75 million from the budget for New York’s parks department. Why was that a bad decision?

It’s understandable that everyone would need to tighten belts, and that the mayor would ask everyone to save money. Parks are often thought of as a luxury, not an essential part of civic welfare, but they are, frankly, as important as almost anything else because they are not just places where people can go to relax.

Given the reality of climate change and our need to deal with storms that are becoming more extreme, our parks collect as much water as half a billion dollars’ worth of infrastructure that New York would have to build."

But Mr. Milei’s political style resembles theirs in many ways. He harshly attacks his critics and the news media, he calls the scientific consensus on climate change a socialist plot, he argues that a shadowy cabal controls the country and he even has an unruly hairdo that has become an online meme.

For many observers, the most worrisome parallel was Mr. Milei’s pre-emptive claims of voter fraud. He has openly questioned the results of the 2020 U.S. election and 2022 Brazilian election, and for months has claimed with scant evidence that the Argentine election was rigged against him. He had warned that if he lost on Sunday, it may have been because the vote was stolen. After signs emerged on Sunday that he would win, Mr. Milei’s campaign told reporters that the election was clean.

Mr. Milei has also downplayed the atrocities of Argentina’s bloody military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983, calling them “excesses” as part of a “war” against leftists. He said during a national debate that the number of people killed under the dictatorship was far smaller than the widely accepted estimates of as many as 30,000 people.

That rhetoric, paired with his warnings of a rigged election, raised broad concerns in Argentina about his potential effect on the nation’s democracy. Ahead of the vote, more than 20 prominent Argentines recorded and released a video promoting democratic values."

The story goes something like this: A powerful A.I. is developed. Its designers are thrilled, then unsettled, then terrified. They go to pull the plug, only to learn the A.I. has copied its code elsewhere, perhaps everywhere.

Keep that story in mind for a moment.

Two signal events have happened in A.I. in recent weeks. One of them you’ve heard about. The nonprofit that governs OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, fired Sam Altman, the company’s chief executive. The decision was unexpected and largely unexplained. “Mr. Altman’s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities,” read a cryptic statement.

Many assumed Altman had lied to the board about OpenAI’s finances or safety data. But Brad Lightcap, an OpenAI executive, told employees that no such breach had occurred. “We can say definitively that the board’s decision was not made in response to malfeasance or anything related to our financial, business, safety or security/privacy practices,” he wrote. “This was a breakdown in communication between Sam and the board.”

At the heart of OpenAI is — or perhaps was — a mission. A.I. was too powerful a technology to be controlled by profit-seeking corporations or power-seeking states. It needed to be developed by an organization, as Open AI’s charter puts it, “acting in the best interests of humanity.” OpenAI was built to be that organization. It began life as a nonprofit. When it became clear that developing A.I. would require tens or hundreds of billions of dollars, it rebuilt itself around a dual structure, where the nonprofit — controlled by a board chosen for its commitment to OpenAI’s founding mission — would govern the for-profit, which would raise the money and commercialize the A.I. applications necessary to finance the mission."

Thanks to its hugely popular ChatGPT chatbot, the San Francisco start-up was at the center of an artificial intelligence boom, and Mr. Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, had become one of the most recognizable people in tech.

But that success raised tensions inside the company. Ilya Sutskever, a respected A.I. researcher who co-founded OpenAI with Mr. Altman and nine other people, was increasingly worried that OpenAI’s technology could be dangerous and that Mr. Altman was not paying enough attention to that risk, according to three people familiar with his thinking. Mr. Sutskever, a member of the company’s board of directors, also objected to what he saw as his diminished role inside the company, according to two of the people.

That conflict between fast growth and A.I. safety came into focus on Friday afternoon, when Mr. Altman was pushed out of his job by four of OpenAI’s six board members, led by Mr. Sutskever. The move shocked OpenAI employees and the rest of the tech industry, including Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion in the company.

For example, consider the fascinating reality that huge percentages of Americans have extremely negative views about the economy in spite of a considerable amount of good economic news. Americans are far more negative about the broader economy than they are about their personal finances.

Republicans, of course, receive a steady stream of negative information about Bidenomics. They’re constantly told that the economy is in a state of crisis. But what of everyone else? Republican disapproval alone can’t fully explain why consumer confidence is roughly at the same place as it was at the height of the Great Recession, even though the economy is growing, unemployment is low, and inflation is slowing. During the Great Recession, by contrast, the economy was shrinking, unemployment was soaring, and there was real concern that the entire global financial system was on the verge of collapse.

But if you’re a politically active progressive, your curated feeds may be full of criticism of late capitalism and examples of economic failure and injustice. As a result, both Bidenomics-hating Republicans and socialism-curious progressives are shockingly negative about an American economy that certainly has problems but is still the envy of most of the world.

In fact, I’d argue that the more politically engaged you are, the harder it is to avoid bespoke realities. The most politically engaged of us are going to spend a disproportionate amount of our spare time perusing political media, much of it online. And each algorithm will notice our political preferences and try to feed us content that matches those preferences.

Understanding this dynamic helps us better understand one of the most interesting and troubling studies of our modern political moment. In June 2019 the group More in Common released a study demonstrating that Americans are wrong about their political opponents in a particularly destructive way: They believe them to be more extreme than they really are. Moreover, those who consumed political media were more wrong about their political opponents than those who consumed no media at all. The study found that those who follow the news “most of the time” were roughly three times as wrong about their opponents as those who follow the news “hardly at all.”"

Rumble on the Senate Floor

On Tuesday, Markwayne Mullin, a Republican senator from Oklahoma, challenged Sean O’Brien, the president of the Teamsters, to a fight during a Senate hearing. The two had previously exchanged insults after Mullin complained that unions were trying to undermine his plumbing business. Asked about his more recent conduct, Mullin told CNN: “I’m not somebody that’s going to say we go around and fight all the time; I got paid to fight. But I will say that every now and then, you do, and you should be taught a lesson.”

To defend his behavior, Mullin pointed to past examples of fighting in the halls of Congress. He noted the caning of Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts by Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina, an incident that left Sumner seriously injured.

I have to say, it is both wild and a little ironic that Mullin would cite this particular incident, which not only foreshadowed the Civil War — Sumner was one of the most prominent antislavery lawmakers in the country — but was also indicative of an ideological extremism that, by the middle of the 1850s, had gripped much of the southern wing of the Democratic Party. That extremism produced a rigid and doctrinaire style of politics that condoned violence and, in short order, destabilized the nation’s political system."

One of his housemates drove him to the emergency department at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. It was dark outside by the time he passed through the busy E.D. and into a room in the hospital. He repeated his story a half-dozen times to various doctors, nurses and trainees as he was poked, prodded, stuck and imaged for hours. The priest was grateful for the quiet of the small room where he was finally able to rest.

Dr. Martin Kaminski was the hospitalist on the night shift. He introduced himself and asked the patient to tell his story, listening as the man described his trip, his weakness, his rash, his fever. His temperature was 102 when he arrived at the hospital but had come down with acetaminophen and IV fluids. When the patient got to the end, Kaminski had a few more questions. Had he used insect repellent while in South America? No, the priest recalled. A fellow priest gave him a wristband that was supposed to keep the mosquitoes away. He hadn’t felt any bites while there. He drank only bottled water, he added. Did he leave the city or go for hikes in wooded areas? Had he been in contact with any domestic or farm animals? No, he was too busy to leave the hotel where the conference was held.

Kaminski asked if he had any body aches. He did. And earlier, his right hand felt achy and a little weak. He had trouble carrying his suitcase. On the ride home, his neck felt strangely weak, as if his head had suddenly gotten much heavier. His neck still felt sore and stiff. The doctor asked him if he could put his chin on his chest. A stiff neck could suggest meningitis. But the patient demonstrated that he could. He was worried, the priest told Kaminski. He had felt this sick only once in his life — and that time was diagnosed with lymphoma. Could it have come back? In the E.D., the hematology-oncology team recommended a CT scan of his chest, abdomen and pelvis, but he hadn’t had it yet. Kaminski told the anxious man that he thought an infection was much more likely than cancer. But they would know more after the CT scan.

A Bite on His Ankle?

As he examined the priest, Kaminski noted that his rash was on his back and arms as well as his chest. It looked like a sunburn, and the red skin paled to near-white when Kaminski pressed his finger into the bright-colored skin on his chest, indicating that it was some kind of inflammation in the skin rather than blood leaking from the vessels below it. There was a tender red nodule on his ankle — possibly a bite. Otherwise, his exam was unremarkable. The lymph nodes in his neck and groin and those under his arms were not enlarged. If he had lymphoma, it wasn’t obvious. Infection was still the most likely cause of his misery."

It’s an uncomfortable subject. It was when I joined, and it still is for me. I don’t think that it has anything to do with music. It doesn’t mean anything to me. I don’t think that female composers are any better than men or any worse. I have friends in the orchestra of both genders.

One of your fans was Bernstein, who led the Philharmonic from 1958 to 1969 and once described you as a “source of radiance in the orchestra.”

I remember when Bernstein said he was going to take some time off to compose something special. I had just bought a book about Masada, the ancient fortress in Israel. I wrote him a letter saying, “I think I found a theme for you for an opera or maybe a cello concerto. And if you want, I can loan you my book.” And the next week at rehearsal he stops and he says: “Orin, thank you for your letter. It’s a very good idea.” And all the guys turned and looked at me and I thought, “Oh my God, I’m never going to write him another letter. Never.” And I never did. I was so embarrassed and humiliated.

You say in the film that you chose the double bass because you liked being in the background. Was that a reaction to the fame of your parents, George O’Brien and Marguerite Churchill, who were both movie stars in the 1930s?

That was definitely part of it. My brother and I would go out to dinner with my father and fans would come up and ask for his autograph. We were bitterly resentful of that because that took him away from us because he loved the attention. “I’d love to sign an autograph.” And we were then deprived of his attention for awhile and we were hurt by that. But you could see that he just reveled in it. He enjoyed the perks of fame and fortune. And my mother probably did, too — she was an actress onstage here in New York before she went to Hollywood. If you’re a bass player, you don’t expect that much attention. And that’s maybe one reason I gravitated to it.

The future for offshore wind farms suddenly seems less certain than it did just a few months ago. Some wind projects in the New York area have been canceled recently. What was behind the decisions to call them off?

Global inflation and supply disruptions have driven up the costs of constructing these massive projects. That has led the companies that build them to plead for bigger subsidies and, in some cases, to pull out altogether.

Last month Orsted, a Danish company, canceled two big projects it was going to build off the coast of New Jersey."
785,785,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/climate/us-china-climate-agreement.html,"The agreement comes two weeks before representatives from nearly 200 countries converge in Dubai as part of the United Nations climate talks known as COP28. The United States and China have an outsize role to play there as nations debate whether to phase out fossil fuel.



“This lays the foundation for the negotiations in Dubai,” said David Sandalow, a veteran of the Clinton and Obama administrations who is now a fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “It sends a strong signal to other countries that this language works, and more broadly that differences can be overcome.”

The agreement does not specify how China will push fossil fuels off its electricity grid. While the United States has displaced some of its fossil fuels by increasing solar and wind power, China has been building more renewable energy than any other country but at the same time has also been constructing new coal-fired power plants.

Still, many of those Chinese coal-fired plants are expected to operate at less than full capacity and the International Energy Agency predicted last month that China’s use of coal will drop in the next several years, and possibly as soon as next year.

An analysis by CarbonBrief, a United Kingdom-based energy publication, found that China’s emissions are likely to fall next year, after they had rebounded from a decline because of coronavirus restrictions. That is in part because of “record installations of low-carbon electricity” that the analysis found could be enough to meet rising electricity demand."

The United States, Russia, Australia, Israel and others have all argued that no new international law is needed for now, while China wants to define any legal limit so narrowly that it would have little practical effect, arms control advocates say.

The result has been to tie the debate up in a procedural knot with little chance of progress on a legally binding mandate anytime soon.

“We do not see that it is really the right time,” Konstantin Vorontsov, the deputy head of the Russian delegation to the United Nations, told diplomats who were packed into a basement conference room recently at the U.N. headquarters in New York.

The debate over the risks of artificial intelligence has drawn new attention in recent days with the battle over control of OpenAI, perhaps the world’s leading A.I. company, whose leaders appeared split over whether the firm is taking sufficient account over the dangers of the technology. And last week, officials from China and the United States discussed a related issue: potential limits on the use of A.I. in decisions about deploying nuclear weapons.

Against that backdrop, the question of what limits should be placed on the use of lethal autonomous weapons has taken on new urgency, and for now has come down to whether it is enough for the U.N. simply to adopt nonbinding guidelines, the position supported by the United States."
787,787,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/opinion/henry-kissinger-the-hypocrite.html,"Mr. Kissinger was not uncomfortable with that dynamic. For him, credibility was rooted in what you did more than what you stood for, even when those actions rendered American concepts of human rights and international law void. He helped extend the war in Vietnam and expand it to Cambodia and Laos, where the United States rained down more bombs than it dropped on Germany and Japan in World War II. That bombing — often indiscriminately massacring civilians — did nothing to improve the terms on which the Vietnam War ended; if anything, it just indicated the lengths to which the United States would go to express its displeasure at losing.

It is ironic that this brand of realism reached its apex at the height of the Cold War, a conflict that was ostensibly about ideology. From the side of the free world, Mr. Kissinger backed genocidal campaigns — by Pakistan against Bengalis and by Indonesia against the East Timorese. In Chile he has been accused of helping to lay the groundwork for a military coup that led to the death of Salvador Allende, the elected leftist president, while ushering in a terrible period of autocratic rule. The generous defense is that Mr. Kissinger represented an ethos that saw the ends (the defeat of the Soviet Union and revolutionary Communism) as justifying the means. But for huge swaths of the world, this mind-set carried a brutal message that America has often conveyed to its own marginalized populations: We care about democracy for us, not for them. Shortly before Mr. Allende’s victory, Mr. Kissinger said, “The issues are much too important for the Chilean voters to be left to decide for themselves.”

Was it all worth it? Mr. Kissinger was fixated on credibility, the idea that America must impose a price on those who ignore our demands to shape the decisions of others in the future. It’s hard to see how the bombing of Laos, the coup in Chile or the killings in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) contributed to the outcome of the Cold War. But Mr. Kissinger’s unsentimental view of global affairs allowed him to achieve consequential breakthroughs with autocratic countries closer to America’s weight class — a détente with the Soviet Union that reduced the escalatory momentum of the arms race and an opening to China that deepened the Sino-Soviet split, integrated the People’s Republic of China into the global order and prefaced Chinese reforms that lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.

The fact that those reforms were initiated by Deng Xiaoping, the same Chinese leader who ordered the crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square, speaks to the ambiguous nature of Mr. Kissinger’s legacy. On the one hand, the U.S.-Chinese rapprochement contributed to the outcome of the Cold War and improved standards of living for the Chinese people. On the other hand, the Chinese Communist Party has emerged as the principal geopolitical adversary of the United States and the vanguard of the authoritarian trend in global politics, putting a million Uyghurs in concentration camps and threatening to invade Taiwan, whose status was left unresolved by Mr. Kissinger’s diplomacy.

Mr. Kissinger lived half of his life after he left government. He blazed what has become a bipartisan trail of ex-officials building lucrative consulting businesses while trading on global contacts. For decades, he was a coveted guest at gatherings of statesmen and tycoons, perhaps because he could always provide an intellectual framework for why some people are powerful and justified in wielding power. He wrote a shelf of books, many of which polished his own reputation as an oracle of global affairs; after all, history is written by men like Henry Kissinger, not by the victims of superpower bombing campaigns, including children in Laos, who continue to be killed by the unexploded bombs that litter their country."

While Ms. Haley’s support has increased, particularly in Iowa, voters have yet to flock to her candidacy in overwhelming numbers. A number of megadonors have taken a wait-and-see approach, keeping an eye on Ms. Haley but remaining on the sidelines.

Now, a little less than 10 weeks before Iowa voters cast the first ballots in the caucuses there, the clock is ticking.

“The momentum is clearly there, but momentum is a very elusive thing,” said Kevin Madden, a former Republican operative who worked on Mitt Romney’s 2012 and 2008 presidential campaigns. “How does she turn it into an avalanche — 1,236 delegates to secure the nomination at the convention? The blueprint for that has yet to be unveiled.”

Ms. Haley’s backers say that Wednesday’s performance should help her continue to make inroads — drawing major donors and gaining support among voters eager for an alternative to Mr. Trump. Ray Hunt, a Texas billionaire, committed funds to the super PAC backing Ms. Haley, Stand for America, the night of the debate, its spokeswoman, Brittany Yanick, confirmed Friday, though she would not disclose the exact amount of his contribution. Ms. Haley’s campaign officials said her campaign collected more than $1 million in the 24 hours after the debate — its best small-dollar fund-raising day to date, coming on the heels of what was its best fund-raising month so far, October.

Fred Zeidman, a Texas businessman who has been one of Ms. Haley’s biggest fund-raisers since the start, said he fielded calls on Wednesday night from people who were “ready to get out their checkbooks.”"
790,790,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/us/politics/kissinger-diplomatic-longevity.html,"When China’s leaders wanted to send a message to the Biden administration last summer, they did what came naturally. They called Henry A. Kissinger.

Mr. Kissinger was 100 years old by then and had left the government 46 years earlier. But for as long as anyone could remember, the Chinese had venerated him as the secretary of state who forged the landmark diplomatic opening to Beijing. They had used him as a channel to Washington ever since.

Knowing him as they did, the Chinese played to his sense of self regard during his visit in July. They feted and flattered him. They put him up in the same guest quarters he had occupied during his historic visits in the 1970s. They hosted meetings in the same building where he had met their predecessors. And President Xi Jinping told Mr. Kissinger that his initial visits had led to 50 years of mostly stable relations and that he hoped this trip would usher in another 50 years.

That last part was the point. After months of friction over a spy balloon and other provocative actions, Mr. Xi was trying to make clear to President Biden’s administration that he wanted to put the tension behind them and repair ties with the United States. Mr. Kissinger returned home and dutifully filled in Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken by phone; met with William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director; and passed along his impressions to Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser."

He moved to the city, a diamond trading hub, after leaving De Beers, where he had worked for 16 years, including five years in Gaborone, Botswana’s capital.

“I saw firsthand how these diamonds do good and how important it is for those communities who live off them,” he said.

This month, International Diamond Center, a 12-store jewelry retailer based in Clearwater, Fla., is planning to introduce Botswanamark’s branded diamonds at four of its stores, Mr. Moltke said, adding that the consumer experience will be similar to the De Beers model.

Greg Kwiat, chief executive of Kwiat Diamonds, a diamond jewelry brand in New York City, said the company’s Mine to Shine traceability program, introduced in June, was likewise based on a desire to show how diamonds positively affect the communities in Africa where they are mined.

Consumers who buy Kwiat diamonds are able to follow their stones from the mine through the stages of cutting and setting into jewelry. “Right now, we’re sharing videos and imagery of the process as it’s occurring,” Mr. Kwiat said. “At the end, you get this aggregated video from start to finish as a wonderful shareable memento.”

Pressure From Consumers

Proving mined diamonds’ origins is something the diamond industry has focused on since the late 1990s, when the blood-diamond crisis shook consumer confidence in the trade. In 2003, a coalition of governments, civil society and diamond industry established the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, aimed at preventing the flow of conflict diamonds."

Mr. Braun was, to say the least, an unusual candidate for clemency.

A Staten Islander with a history of violent threats, Mr. Braun had told a rabbi who owed him money: “I am going to make you bleed.” Mr. Braun’s family had told confidants they were willing to spend millions of dollars to get him out of prison.

At the time, Mr. Trump’s own Justice Department and federal regulators, as well as New York state authorities, were still after him for his role in an entirely separate matter: his work as a predatory lender, making what judges later found were fraudulent and usurious loans to cash-strapped small businesses."

Then late last year, the machines abruptly started falling from the sky as they returned from missions.

“It was this mystery,” said Sven Kruck, a Quantum executive who received a stern letter from Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense demanding a fix.

Quantum’s engineers soon homed in on the issue: Russians were jamming the wireless signals that connected the drones to the satellites they relied on for navigation, leading the machines to lose their way and plummet to earth. To adjust, Quantum developed artificial intelligence-powered software to act as a kind of secondary pilot and added a manual option so the drones could be landed with an Xbox controller. The company also built a service center to monitor Russia’s electronic attacks.

The S&P 500 was on its way to a ninth straight day of gains on Thursday when investors got hit by a double whammy: a lackluster auction for 30-year Treasury bonds and more hawkish words from Jay Powell, the Fed chair, that prompted a sell-off in stocks and bonds.

The snapped winning streak — which would have been the index’s longest since 2004 — was a reminder that inflation and global growth concerns remain high, especially given the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Stock futures this morning are pointing to another weak open.

Powell hasn’t dismissed the possibility of raising rates. The subdued jobs report released last week led many on Wall Street to predict that the Fed would stop increasing borrowing costs. Not so fast, the central bank’s chief suggested at an event hosted by the International Monetary Fund in Washington.

He called out the “head fakes” posed by fluctuating inflation data, and reiterated that the door remained open for further interest rate increases.

After directing expletives at those businesses, Musk then cheekily added, “Hi, Bob, if you’re in the audience.” Linda Yaccarino, X’s C.E.O. whom Musk hired to win back advertisers (and who was at the summit), later posted a more conciliatory message.

“Do you want the best car, or do you not want the best car?” Whether people love Musk or hate him, the mogul boasted about the capabilities of Tesla vehicles and SpaceX rockets.

“A philosophy of curiosity.” Pressed on what drives him, Musk turned contemplative, speaking at length about a difficult childhood and how he has grappled with an existential crisis he first felt at age 12. His answer: Ensure humanity reaches the stars and settles other planets, hence his work at SpaceX. “If you’re a single-planet civilization,” he said, “something will happen to that planet, and you will die.”

“I’m quite concerned that there’s some dangerous element of A.I. that they’ve discovered.” Asked about the recent leadership shake-up at OpenAI, which he co-founded before leaving in 2019, Musk said that he was worried about the speed at which it had been pushing innovation. He predicted that the technology could reach the point of problem-solving like the human brain — so-called artificial general intelligence — in less than three years. (Jensen Huang, the C.E.O. of the A.I. chipmaker Nvidia, reckoned that milestone would take at least a decade.)

“I think I would not vote for [President] Biden.” Musk, who has turned politically conservative in recent years, criticized the president for snubbing Tesla in the company’s green-energy initiatives, despite its leadership in electric vehicles. The billionaire also said that liberals tended to embrace censorship now, anathema to the self-described free speech “absolutist.” But when asked if he would then vote for Donald Trump, Biden’s likely Republican opponent, Musk demurred, saying only, “this is definitely a difficult choice.”

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING

Henry Kissinger dies at 100. One of America’s most powerful diplomats in recent memory, he helped reshape the world order during the Cold War, including by normalizing U.S. relations with China, brokering détente with the Soviet Union and negotiating the end of the Vietnam War. Kissinger was alternately lauded for his accomplishments and castigated for an approach that abandoned American values when deemed necessary.

The U.A.W. unveils its plan to organize nonunionized automakers. The United Automobile Workers union said it was courting potential union recruits at more than a dozen companies, including Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen, which together employ more than 150,000 workers. Separately, G.M. will cut spending at its Cruise subsidiary after pausing operations there amid concerns about the safety of its autonomous vehicles.

Disney adds two directors as activist investors circle. James Gorman, the outgoing C.E.O. of Morgan Stanley, and Jeremy Darroch, the former head of the British media company Sky, are joining the Disney board ahead of an expected fight with the financier Nelson Peltz. Disney said that Gorman would help with C.E.O. succession planning, a concern of Peltz’s."
796,796,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/opinion/sunday/republican-war-mexico.html,"As president, Donald Trump reportedly floated the idea of shooting “missiles into Mexico to destroy the drug labs.” When his defense secretary, Mark Esper, raised various objections, he recalls that Mr. Trump responded by saying the bombing could be done “quietly”: “No one would know it was us.”

Well, word got out and the craze caught on. Now many professed rebel Republicans, such as Representatives Mike Waltz and Marjorie Taylor Greene, along with several old G.O.P. war horses, like Senator Lindsey Graham, want to bomb Mexico. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said he would send special forces into Mexico on “Day 1” of his presidency, targeting drug cartels and fentanyl labs. In May, Representative Michael McCaul, another Republican, introduced a bill pushing for fentanyl to be listed as a chemical weapon, like sarin gas, under the Chemical Weapons Convention. This move targeted Mexican cartels and Chinese companies, which are accused of providing the ingredients to the cartels to manufacture fentanyl.

Of course, the United States is already fighting, and has been for half a century, a highly militarized drug war — in the Andes, Central America and, yes, Mexico — a war as ineffective as it has been cruel. Hitting fentanyl labs won’t do anything to slow the bootlegged versions of the drug into the United States but could further destabilize northern Mexico and the borderlands, worsening the migrant refugee crisis.

Addiction to fentanyl, a drug that is 50 times stronger than heroin, affects red and blue states alike, from West Virginia to Maine, with overdoses annually killing tens of thousands of Americans. It’s a bipartisan crisis. Yet in our topsy-turvy culture wars, there’s a belief that fentanyl is targeting the Republican base. J.D. Vance rose to national fame in 2016 with a book that blamed the white rural poor’s cultural pathologies for their health crises, including drug addiction. In 2022, during his successful run for Ohio’s Senate seat, Mr. Vance, speaking with a right-wing conspiracy theorist, said that “if you wanted to kill a bunch of MAGA voters in the middle of the heartland, how better than to target them and their kids with this deadly fentanyl?” Mr. Vance’s poll numbers shot up after that, and other Republicans in close House and Senate races took up the issue, linking fentanyl deaths to Democratic policies on border security and crime and calling for military action against Mexico."

It took jurors just four-and-a-half hours yesterday to reach a verdict in the monthlong fraud trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the fallen cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The result was unanimous: guilty on all counts.

Bankman-Fried has now completed a narrative arc from whiz-kid founder of a crypto empire to fraudster who stole billions in customer funds. It is a tale that humbled Silicon Valley titans and A-list celebrities. And it leaves unclear the future of an industry for which he was the poster child and chief promoter.

Bankman-Fried showed little emotion as the verdict was read, standing in court in a gray suit and purple tie, his hair long since shorn of the curly mop that was his signature look. His parents, Stanford law professors, displayed more: His mother put her head in her hands and sobbed; his father doubled over. The 31-year-old nodded at his parents as he was led back to jail.

From the start of the trial, Bankman-Fried faced long odds. Prosecutors moved to paint the FTX founder — who appeared on magazine covers and hobnobbed with former world leaders — as a scammer who repeatedly lied about his business and profited from illegal use of investor and customer funds. “This was a fraud that occurred on a massive scale,” Nicolas Roos, a prosecutor, said in closing arguments."

So were scenes of young migrants idling on sidewalks, stoops and park benches, desperate to work but legally prohibited from doing so.

For those of us who were once part of such a moment, the scenes stirred up memories and reflections on how different some things were now for new arrivals and how much they were the same. I, too, was once part of a migrant influx.

In the years after the end of World War II, New York City absorbed a similar wave of immigrants — a large majority of the 140,000 Jewish Holocaust survivors who came to America between 1946 and 1953 — and it did so comparatively smoothly and uneventfully. These immigrants were eager to get on with their lives but were still in shock or heartbroken from the brutalities they had suffered, the parents and siblings they had lost, and the hometowns they could no longer return to.

Those who had no relatives to stay with were put up in 14 hotels that had seen better days as well as in a shelter hacked out of the former Astor Library on Lafayette Street, which is now the Public Theater."
799,799,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/14/opinion/tim-scott-republican-party.html,"The book itself suggested otherwise — that Mr. Scott was not only as fixated on his own color as the critics he scorned but also as determined to make use of it. The words “Black” or “African American” appear 75 times, or once every three-and-a-half pages — often within its capsule biographies of Black figures like Jackie Robinson and Madam C.J. Walker, whom Mr. Scott evidently sees as his historic peers. In truth and by design, the book is as much a kind of Black History Month reader as it is about Mr. Scott’s own life. And even that material begins with his grandfather teaching his mother how to pick cotton.

Ben Carson’s more successful run for the Republican nomination in 2016 seemed to have some of what Mr. Scott’s campaign lacked — though almost forgotten today, Mr. Carson, unlike Mr. Scott, actually found his way to the top tier of contenders for a time. To be sure, the substance of Mr. Carson’s commentary on race did resemble Mr. Scott’s. In a representative interview with the conservative talk radio host Dennis Prager, he both denied the persistence of deep racial inequality in American society — “Race doesn’t really keep you down in this country if you get a good education” — and argued that the racism worth worrying about was coming from his progressive critics. “It’s mostly with the progressive movement who will look at someone like me, and because of the color of my pigment, they decide that there’s a certain way that I’m supposed to think,” he said. “And if I don’t think that way, I’m an Uncle Tom and they heap all kinds of hatred on you. That, to me, is racism.”

But unlike Mr. Scott, Mr. Carson rarely discussed race of his own volition, on or off the stump. “Asked about it,” Molly Ball observed in The Atlantic, “he tends to deflect, rejecting racial distinctions as divisive.” And to the extent that Mr. Carson’s campaign did attempt to harness race to its advantage, as it did in a pair of conservative talk radio ads it aired before South Carolina’s primary that year, it did so the old-fashioned way: appealing to the racial anxieties and outright racism of white right-of-center voters. One of the South Carolina ads “inveighed against affirmative action as ‘racial entitlement’ while the other depicted Black crime as a ‘crisis,’” Ms. Ball wrote. “Taken together, the ads were a striking attempt to provoke white voters’ racial attitudes by a candidate who has otherwise avoided the subject.”

Mr. Carson’s own bootstraps story, meanwhile, mirrors Mr. Scott’s in certain respects — both men came to success from poverty and broken homes — but Mr. Carson’s personal narrative was also a tale of Christian redemption. As he tells it, he worked past the anger and violence of his youth through studying the Bible, which made him famous among the conservative evangelicals who would take an interest in his campaign long before he entered politics.

Mr. Scott has nothing like that story in his own narrative — a comparatively simple rags-to-Republican tale about the virtues of hard work and rejecting racial victimhood that, while appealing in the abstract to essentially everyone on the right, wasn’t compelling enough to excite any important constituency in particular. So where Mr. Carson ran largely as a conventional evangelical Republican candidate — racial dog whistles and all — Mr. Scott actively tried and failed to make a race-based message connect."

Still, the difficulty for her, as for all the candidates attempting to emerge as a Trump alternative, is that “what a conservative is has been redefined by Trump himself,” he said.

Mr. Trump’s lead over the field is dominant nationally and in every early state polled, and it remains uncertain that Ms. Haley could peel away enough of his faithful, no matter her approach, to come out on top. And what has so far propelled her could also become a liability, should she alienate one or more faction. Her rivals, including Mr. Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, have sought to portray her as insufficiently conservative and as someone who panders to Democrats. Jaime Harrison, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, labeled her a “snake oil salesman” who “will say whatever she needs to say to get power.”

Her campaign officials and surrogates argue her politics have stayed the same, with the country and the world changing around her. “Nikki has always been a tough, anti-establishment conservative,” said Olivia Perez-Cubas, a spokeswoman for Ms. Haley.

Ms. Haley’s attempt to thread the needle on abortion is already being tested, as she has faced skepticism from Iowa’s evangelical community, a critical voting bloc. Addressing a conservative Christian audience in Iowa, Ms. Haley said she would have signed a ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy as governor.

Democrats seized on Ms. Haley’s remarks as proof that, despite her tone, she is no moderate on the issue. The influential evangelical leader Bob Vander Plaats, who previously indicated that clear-cut abortion opposition would be the driving factor for his support, went on to endorse Mr. DeSantis. But just days earlier, Ms. Haley had received a seemingly impromptu endorsement from Marlys Popma, the former head of the state Republican Party and one of Iowa’s most prominent anti-abortion activists — who indicated she was comfortable with Ms. Haley’s stance."

Over just three days, the landscape for artificial intelligence has been reshaped drastically. On Friday morning, Sam Altman was the C.E.O. of OpenAI, the leader in commercializing generative A.I. through ChatGPT. By Monday, he had not only been fired by his board — he had also joined Microsoft, the start-up’s biggest backer.

What happened is more than just a juicy corporate tale. At stake are the fates of major A.I. players like OpenAI and Microsoft. And it’s a reminder of serious divides within the A.I. community — and questions about how that industry is led.

A recap:

OpenAI’s board fired Altman for not being “consistently candid.” Greg Brockman, another co-founder, was stripped of his chairman title and quit. The two began pitching a new A.I. start-up that evening.

Investors in OpenAI — who have little power because of the company’s quirky corporate governance structure (more on that below) — began plotting a way for Altman to return, with the encouragement of OpenAI executives. Altman returned to the office, marking the moment with a selfie that went viral.

Talks to bring Altman back broke down, with OpenAI’s board eventually naming Emmett Shear, the former C.E.O. of the streaming service Twitch, as its interim leader, replacing Mira Murati, the company’s C.T.O. who had replaced Altman.

Altman and Brockman are joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced research lab, and are likely to hire several former colleagues. (Some OpenAI employees workers wrote on X that “OpenAI is nothing without its people,” posts that Altman liked.)

OpenAI’s future is much murkier. According to The Information, rivals are looking to pick off workers. And a tender offer for OpenAI shares held by employees at an $86 billion valuation appears in doubt.

It’s unclear how much OpenAI’s strategy will change. Altman disagreed with board members — particularly Ilya Sutskever, another co-founder and the company’s chief scientist — about how quickly to commercialize new technologies. Sutskever, like Elon Musk and the A.I. pioneer Geoffrey Hinton, is deeply worried that A.I. could threaten humanity, and may now push the company to move much more slowly."

With a year to go before Election Day, polls increasingly show that American voters believe next year will be a rematch between President Biden and Donald Trump — with the former president in the lead in key battleground states despite his legal troubles (more on that below).

Biden’s troubles stem in large part from negative perceptions about the economy, even as several indications show that it is performing strongly. Here’s a deeper look at what “Bidenomics” has, and hasn’t, accomplished.

On the positive side: jobs. Since Biden took office, employers have created 14 million jobs, and the unemployment rate has been hovering around a 50-year-low for months.

The president has also been talking up signature economic accomplishments like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which he argues have helped rebuild rural America and invigorated the economy. “Bidenomics is just another way of saying the American dream,” he said in a speech. It’s not a stretch. The economy grew last quarter at nearly 5 percent, belying a global slowdown."

HOW ARE THINGS in Glocca Morra?” is a song from the 1947 musical “Finian’s Rainbow,” which is about, among other things, a leprechaun. Glocca Morra doesn’t exist, and if it did, it wouldn’t be in, say, Poland. The song is sung by a homesick Irish lass in the American South; like the show overall, it is the most goyish thing that ever happened on Broadway, unless that would be “Brigadoon,” which opened the same year, with its highland heather and men in kilts. That one’s about a town that awakens only once every hundred years, also not in Poland.

Or is it? Like the score for “Brigadoon,” by Lerner and Loewe, the score for “Finian’s Rainbow” was written by two Jews: E.Y. Harburg (né Isidore Hochberg; the “Y” stood for “Yipsel”) and Burton Lane (né Burton Levy). The show was produced, stage managed and for the most part designed by Jews. The musical director, dance arranger and press reps were Jews. In a city then home to more than two million Jews — even now, the most Jewish city in the world, by sheer numbers — so were a lot of the ticket buyers. (Twenty years later, the playwright and screenwriter William Goldman estimated that Jews made up half the Broadway audience.) Did they hear something familiar in the tune of “Glocca Morra,” even as the lyrics, saluting “Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare,” denied it?

Of course, many gentiles also appreciated the yearning-for-a-simpler-time song, which reached deep into American culture in those postwar years. Along with several other tunes from the show — “Old Devil Moon,” “Look to the Rainbow,” “If This Isn’t Love” — “Glocca Morra” was a popular hit, covered by Sammy Davis Jr., Julie Andrews, Connie Francis, Rosemary Clooney, the Tommy Dorsey band and, over time, some hundred others. Davis, a convert, was the most Jewish among them.

Or he was until the song was sung, around 1967, at my temple. For the edification of our suburban Philadelphia congregation, the rabbi’s wife put on annual shows that spoofed Broadway hits with Jewish-themed puns. “How Are Things in Glocca Morra?” became “How Are Things in the Gemara?” — the Gemara being an ancient work of rabbinical commentary, and thus a boffo punchline in the synagogue stageatorium. “How Are Things in the Gemara?” was funny, it was lovely, it was filled with longing — and it was ours.

You couldn’t say that about most of what appeared on American stages in the 1940s, musical or otherwise, unless you knew the secret. Though Jews had been an integral part of mainstream theater for decades — creating, presenting, teaching and consuming it — and had found in it the ultimate and most enduring expression of their artistry, seldom was the product Jewish on the surface. The same year that “Finian’s Rainbow” and “Brigadoon” opened on Broadway, Arthur Miller’s “All My Sons” did, too. A morality play about an airplane parts manufacturer whose corner cutting leads to the death of 21 airmen, it is virtually Talmudic in its exquisite weighing of individual and communal responsibility. Everything about it is Jewish except the characters.

Tap to open × Pinch to zoom. Tap to explore. This past summer, T invited dozens of Jewish actors, playwrights, songwriters and directors to join their collaborators and colleagues for a group portrait in New York, onstage at Broadway’s Lyceum Theater. When nearly 50 of them arrived on Sept. 11, 2023, it was all but impossible to get them to take their places as they sang songs, told jokes and shared stories of lives spent — together, joyously — in the theater.

Nor is it a one-off. Like many Jewish playwrights of the period, Miller, barely a generation away from a Polish shtetl himself, erased the Jews if not the Jewishness from almost all his reputational works. The putatively gentile “Death of a Salesman,” which had its premiere two years after “All My Sons,” sounds to me, with its Yiddish cadence (“Take an aspirin. Should I get you an aspirin?”) and revolving arguments, like the fractious seders at my grandparents’ apartment. (I’ve never heard a non-Jew say “dast” for “dare” as the down-to-earth Charley does: “Nobody dast blame this man.”) And though “The Crucible” (1953) is set among Massachusetts Puritans and “A View From the Bridge” (1955) among Italian American dockworkers, they, too, feel rabbinical in their ethical wrangling. It wasn’t until the 1960s, with “After the Fall,” a fictionalized rehash of his relationship with Marilyn Monroe, and “Incident at Vichy,” a Holocaust drama, that Jews really showed up — unavoidably and somewhat self-consciously — in Miller’s plays.

By then they were showing up elsewhere, too, often in popular comedies and musicals that highbrow Jewish critics nevertheless despised. Robert Brustein called “Biloxi Blues,” among Neil Simon’s most Jewish works, “meretricious.” Cynthia Ozick described “Fiddler on the Roof,” the 1964 megahit based on Sholom Aleichem stories about impoverished Ukrainian Jews, as “romantic vulgarization” — and Philip Roth trumped her with “shtetl kitsch.” (Had either of them ever seen a musical before?) Miller could write Jewishly, but not about Jews; Simon could write about Jews, but not Jewishly. Damned either way, it seems, but no one said assimilation would be easy.

Well actually, in “Candide” (1956), Leonard Bernstein says just that. A character known as the Old Lady, passing herself off as Spanish though her father “spoke a High Middle Polish,” celebrates her chameleon skills in a song called “I Am Easily Assimilated.” The composer’s own lyrics: “These days, you have to be / In the majority.”

WHICH BRINGS US to the matter of Lenny’s nose, or rather Bradley Cooper’s embodiment of it in the Bernstein biopic “Maestro.”

Before the film’s release last month, Cooper’s prosthetic schnoz drew criticism from many Jews, alert to the re-emergence of a hateful caricature that had trailed them for centuries, often attached to actors. It wasn’t so long ago that gentiles playing Shylock in William Shakespeare’s “The Merchant of Venice” did so in “Jewface,” with a large and pendulous hook nose meant to telegraph animality and greed. (Shakespeare describes Shylock variously as a “wolf,” a “cur” and a “cutthroat dog.”) Whether the actor who originated the role in the 1590s wore a wax honker is unknown, but the stereotype was certainly familiar by then. In Christopher Marlowe’s nearly contemporaneous “The Jew of Malta,” the title character’s Moorish slave says, “Oh, brave master, I worship your nose for this.”

Even without the noses — and despite, in Shakespeare’s case, the mitigating poetry — both plays are viciously antisemitic. There’s a reason “The Merchant of Venice,” according to some historians, was the most produced Shakespeare play in Germany during the Third Reich. As the theater scholar Farah Karim-Cooper notes in her book “The Great White Bard” (2023), audiences are strongly influenced by disinformation onstage. In a 2010 study she cites, playgoers in Sweden, Germany and England were asked to evaluate the statement “The reason for antisemitism is the behavior of the Jews in history” both before and after seeing “Merchant.” One out of four found the statement “more correct” afterward. And Shylock was seen as a “typical” Jew by nearly a third.

That shouldn’t surprise us if we believe in the power of theater to confirm and even create opinions and feelings. Whether that power is used toward good ends or bad, the medium itself is unconcerned.

Jews do not have that luxury: The Anti-Defamation League reports that antisemitic incidents in the United States increased to record levels last year; disturbing comments from public figures seemed to increase even more. Yet if Cooper’s prosthesis is too silly a hill to stand on in that context, violence against Jews, whether verbal or physical — from Kanye West’s vitriol to the 2018 Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh to the recent terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians by Hamas — has often seemed too complex for artists, with their tendency toward both-sides-ism, to face. (What about free speech? What about Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians?) Especially in the theater, a supposed safe space for Jews, the response to historical, no less than imminent, threats has always been erratic and constrained.

Not because of a lack of overtly Jewish content. Indeed, the irony is that more shows than ever, both premieres and revivals, seem to be dealing with antisemitism, at least in the past. That they rarely get to the heart of the issue — the sometimes self-imposed (and sometimes viciously enforced) invisibility of Jewishness — is the result of a fear of offense or habit of disguise that evolved as a kind of protection for Jews both onstage and off. Any Roth novel will teach you, as my own childhood taught me, that you must assimilate to a certain degree to survive in an antisemitic world; I stopped talking about “Fiddler” when classmates started calling me “kike.” Yet assimilate too much and something integral to your nature dissolves; for me it would have been like killing my grandparents, as they often made sure to tell me.

Waffling over the expression of identity is probably inherent to all American minority experiences, but it is especially central to, and problematic for, Jewish art, which is often specifically about that waffling and takes its argumentative shape from it, too. But if this “see me/don’t see me” dichotomy has roots as deep as the history of Jews in the American theater, reflecting the age-old conflict of writing for everyone while still being seen for yourself, it was nonetheless shocking to hear, in 2023, what one Broadway insider told me: “Mostly we keep quiet because if we talk, they ship us on the trains.”

This fear persists even though, as I’ve said, New York City stages have in the past year offered a bumper crop of plays and musicals that speak to the subject of antisemitism. Tom Stoppard’s semi-autobiographical “Leopoldstadt” dramatizes the results of the Nazi Anschluss on a Viennese Jewish family in the 1930s and after. “The Doctor,” a revamp of a 1912 Arthur Schnitzler play, starred Juliet Stevenson as Ruth Wolff, a prominent Jewish physician canceled by anti-Semites. The best scenes in the revival of “The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window,” Lorraine Hansberry’s 1964 takedown of a hypocritical Greenwich Village Jew, feature Sidney’s casually antisemitic sister-in-law. The comedian Alex Edelman’s “Just for Us” recounts his infiltration of a white supremacist group in a misguided attempt at “outreach.” And things really went meta at the first preview of “Parade,” a revival of the 1998 musical about Leo Frank, the New York Jew lynched in Georgia in 1915. Outside the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, around a dozen protesters representing the Empire State Stormers (a neo-Nazi group affiliated with the so-called Goyim Defense League) yelled at playgoers and distributed fliers attacking Frank as a “Jewish child-murdering pedophile.”

Even so, the most pointed onstage treatment of antisemitism, connecting it to the nature of allyship and lip service within the theater itself, may have been the one that turned the subject into a joke. In “Gutenberg! The Musical!” — a satire in the guise of a backers’ audition for a horrible show about the inventor of the printing press — two aspiring Broadway writers pause their opening patter to announce somberly that since “every important musical has to tackle at least one incredibly serious issue,” theirs will be antisemitism. That’s the last you hear of it, except when a character called Antisemitic Flower Girl occasionally barks things like “I hate Jews” to big audience guffaws.

“Gutenberg! The Musical!” opened a few days after the Hamas attacks and, in the wake of the terrifying news, some Jewish actors, producers and writers began to feel that the real Broadway wasn’t doing much more than the satirical one in “Gutenberg.” Where was the clear response from their non-Jewish colleagues? Having rightly been asked to educate themselves and speak out about threats to other communities, Jews worried in anxious, private conversations why the same education and outspokenness seemed absent when it came to them. “When it’s time to say, ‘Are you here for us?’” one told me, “I fear that they are not.”

In these conversations, some Jews also wondered if they were partly responsible for the failure of others to see them as a marginalized group — or to see them at all. Had Jewish creatives participated in, and in essence condoned, the sidelining of Jewishness on Broadway, a street they basically built? Two of the three fine actors who starred in 2021 in “The Lehman Trilogy” — a multigenerational epic about the Jewish banking family — were gentiles. So is Oscar Isaac, the Sidney in “Sidney Brustein.” (Well, Isaac has some Jewish heritage on his father’s side, hence the “Isaac.”) Both shows were directed by Jews. Stevenson, who played Ruth Wolff in “The Doctor,” would not say what if any faith she practiced. (Nor would that show’s director, Robert Icke.) This list goes on, and is even more striking in film and television, well beyond the Roman Catholic Cooper. In casting Rachel Brosnahan as the title character on “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” — a comedian obviously modeled on the assertively Jewish Joan Rivers — its producers achieved a difficult double de-Jewification. (On Broadway, though, Brosnahan played Sidney Brustein’s gentile wife.) And did you ever see the nasal monstrosity that Alec Guinness (also Roman Catholic) wears as Fagin in the 1948 film “Oliver Twist,” three years after the liberation of Auschwitz? Where was his impeccable timing then?

As a critic, I’m supposed to be agnostic about such matters; if someone’s good, they’re good. Cooper, a graduate of the Actors Studio, is excellent and, if the nose helped him get there, nobody dast blame the man for that.

But as a coreligionist of Bernstein and Miller and Simon and Rivers and Wolff and the Lehmans, as well as of the Brusteins both Robert and Sidney, I find myself forced, after a season that kept foisting ideas of doomed Jewishness on us — and with a new season continuing to do so with the Holocaust-themed “Harmony,” “Prayer for the French Republic” and “Cabaret” — to question that agnosticism. Who, after all, is all this trauma for? Must the cultural place for endangered minorities always be reduced to their danger only? I have seen too many plays use the Holocaust as a dramatic accelerant or a free pass to pathos.

Jews already know their trauma too well. Others seem to enjoy it or, worse, think of it as a moral vitamin. And though I’m not categorically opposed to the educational function of theater, what troubles me is what isn’t getting said. The theater, which for many Jews was a major way of becoming American in the first place, seems unable to acknowledge that the danger that American Jews face is not just historical, and not just onstage.

“Have we assimilated too much for people to even see us?” one Broadway producer asked me in the week after the Hamas attacks.

I, too, can’t help thinking about the mixed blessing of assimilation, both a goal and a trap. How is it that Jews, in successive waves and for different reasons, keep getting erased from the theatrical culture they did so much to create? Stranger still, they often seem to be holding the eraser — and the scalpel. The nose Cooper put on is the one Jews have spent a century taking off.

IN 1923, LEE Strasberg, a 21-year-old New York City high school dropout with an interest in theater but a job as a bookkeeper in a wigmaker’s shop, saw Konstantin Stanislavsky’s Moscow Art Theater perform at Jolson’s Fifty-Ninth Street Theater.

Known for its emphasis on the inner life of characters and the rigorous discipline demanded of actors to reproduce it, the Russian troupe, founded in 1898, was presenting six plays in repertory, including “The Lower Depths,” “The Three Sisters” and “Tsar Fyodor Ivanovich.” Grim stuff, but the dropout, Strasberg, sat rapt at every performance.

Though the plays were performed in Russian, a language Strasberg didn’t understand, the subtle artistry of the actors — so different from the operatic histrionics typical of the time — seemed to reach out from the stage and offer a lifeline. His had not been a particularly happy or fulfilling life to date. Born Israel Strassberg on a Polish shtetl, and known by the diminutive Srulke, he came to America in 1909 and lived meanly with his family on the Lower East Side. The death of his beloved older brother Zalmon during the influenza pandemic of 1918 nearly undid him; it was Zalmon who had encouraged his interest in Yiddish culture. Srulke performed in local Yiddish-language productions, saw professional plays when he could and embarked on a course of his own wide reading. But the realities of the stage did not match the ideals of his imagination until his encounter with the work of the man who, by any other standards, would have seemed his antipodal foil.

Stanislavsky, the Art Theater’s co-director and most famous teacher, was born in 1863 to a landed Christian family, manufacturers of gold and silver thread. His education was enriched by his access to great art and by his exposure to a semi-mystical Eastern Orthodox sect known as the Old Believers. So when later writing of the actor’s “soul” in his seminal mid-20th-century books “An Actor Prepares” and “Building a Character,” it was no metaphor for sensitivity. Rather, as the cultural historian and critic Isaac Butler told me, Stanislavsky believed that people who aspired to work in the theater “were called to a literally holy task.”

How an ideal of acting proposed by a rich, cosmopolitan Christian came to be interpreted, promoted and glorified in the United States primarily by poor, tenement-raised Jews is the mystery at the center of Butler’s book “The Method: How the Twentieth Century Learned to Act” (2022). Part of the answer, he says, is the “shall-we-say comfort with debate at sometimes very loud volumes” that is almost a Jewish article of faith. And part of it, at least in the case of Strasberg and his founding colleagues Harold Clurman and Stella Adler, was an “almost Talmudic level of scholarship.”

But bigger than both was the Yiddish theater: a keepsake of home, and yet also a means of acculturation for the 2.5 million Jews who arrived in the United States between 1881 and 1924. The tradition of popular drama (and especially comedy) was one of the few forms of cultural expression they could bring with them on boats besides their recipes and religion. And if in the old country the Yiddish theater looked mostly inward, addressing its own communities, in the new country, especially in New York, where most Jews settled, it began to move outward, drawing even non-Yiddish-speaking audiences to a parallel Broadway along Second Avenue. In the district’s many theaters they might see the Yiddish shocker “The Dybbuk” (1920) or translations of the works of George Bernard Shaw and Henrik Ibsen that had not yet appeared in the city in English.

That was the world in which Strasberg, Clurman and Adler grew up. (Both of Adler’s parents were Yiddish theater stars — her father, Jacob Adler, was a renowned Shylock in 1903.) For them, the theater was a form that united intellectual rigor with expressive potential but also offered a path into the mainstream, or at least a louche branch of it. At a time when only a few industries (including banking and the garment trade) were open to Jews, it was a way for them to commodify their intelligence. The problem was that, with its pandering and bellowing, the Yiddish version was no longer enough.

Seeing the Moscow Art Theater perform in the early 1920s amounted to a conversion experience for all three; learning how actors could experience real feelings onstage, in detail and in depth, became their life’s goal.

But because, like most converts, they were zealots, it wasn’t just a conversion experience for them. Through their later roles as founders and leaders of the Group Theater, the Actors Studio and other schools and programs, they turned Stanislavsky’s system into the Method — and the Method into the prevailing style of American acting. Embedding their own observation and experience within Stanislavsky’s, along with the best of Yiddish theater and a generous dollop of Freud, they converted the American theater to Judaism.

Sara Krulwich/The New York Times

Perhaps it was the embedding — a kind of secret coding — that made it an influential yet ultimately unstable conversion, schismatic and contradictory. Strasberg would break away from Clurman, Clurman would marry and divorce Adler, Adler would disown Strasberg and start her own school; their friend Sanford Meisner would develop a splinter Method, and so would the fifth of the foundational figures, Bobby Lewis (né Lewkowitz). In whatever configurations, they and their colleagues, most of whom were likewise Jewish, trained and helped make stars of generations of students, most of whom were not. Adler begat Marlon Brando; Strasberg, James Dean; Meisner, Robert Duvall; Lewis, Meryl Streep.

Clurman most famously begat Clifford Odets, urging the young Group Theater actor to write plays, and directing one of his earliest — “Awake and Sing!” — in 1935. “Awake and Sing!” was among the first plays on Broadway (and for ages among the last) to deal frankly with poor Jewish characters, the kind that most of the cast, including Adler, Meisner and a 21-year-old who was born Jacob Garfinkle, but now called Jules Garfield, knew deeply because that’s what they were, too. Odets even gave them unreconstructed Jewish names. Adler, though only 34, played Bessie Berger, the matriarch of an impoverished Bronx family terrified of eviction. Meisner played Sam Feinschreiber, an immigrant boarder. And Garfield played Ralph Berger, Bessie’s idealistic son.

“Awake and Sing!” was a sensation and a breakthrough, proof of concept for the Group’s Americanized Method. Its title seemed to be, as well, an exhortation to proclaim Jewishness loudly as integral to the culture. But Broadway did not seriously take up the call, and Hollywood utterly ignored it. (“Awake and Sing!” wasn’t filmed until a version was made for television in 1972.) What the studios wanted was the talent, without their Jewish baggage. So when Jules Garfield quickly became a movie star, he did so under the name John. He soon joined Adler, who had gone to Hollywood earlier in 1937, changing her name to Ardler and getting a nose job.

NOBODY DAST BLAME them, either. Jews are not responsible for antisemitism, even the kind they internalize in trying to avoid the external kind. Adler and Garfield weighed the conflict between pride and practicality, between pronouncing their Jewishness and getting a job, and landed, as thousands of others did, on the side of paying the rent. That this clash of values and exigencies was in fact the theme of “Awake and Sing!” — in which Bessie forces her pregnant daughter into a loveless marriage with Feinschreiber — wouldn’t have been lost on them.

For Adler and so many others, Hollywood was the loveless marriage. Even with name and nose changes, most of the great Jewish stage stars of the era had middling film careers. The anticipated trade-off failed in an industry that, led by the Jewish studio heads, was paranoid, or perhaps just accurate and spineless, about American prejudice. William Fox, Louis B. Mayer, Jack Warner and the rest rarely made movies with juicy Jewish roles; when they did, they seemed to go to perverse lengths not to cast Jews in them. In “Marjorie Morningstar” (1958), about a Jewish woman who changes her name from Morgenstern to further her showbiz dreams, Marjorie is played by the Russian Orthodox Natalie Wood. And when “The Diary of Anne Frank” was made into a movie in 1959, an unknown non-Jew named Millie Perkins got the role, which Audrey Hepburn of all people had already declined. On Broadway four years earlier, the play had starred Susan Strasberg — Lee’s daughter.

At least on New York stages, to which Adler, reclaiming her name, returned around 1943, you might have expected the Method machine, as it churned out actors, playwrights and directors for decades, to give rise to an abundance of Jewish theatrical content. It didn’t.

Assimilation, easy or not, is never just a reaching toward something; it’s a turning away from something else. When the something you are turning away from includes poverty, parochialism and disdain, the urge to represent more than one’s own inheritance, or simply to bury it, may be even stronger. For many Jewish actors, especially in the wake of the Holocaust, it must have seemed safer to stake a claim in the larger world rather than the vulnerable little sector they happened to emerge from. And as artists their goal was surely to play Shakespeare and Ibsen in English, not just Sholom Aleichem in Yiddish.

Jews were neither the first nor certainly the last minority to anguish over that conflict between representing and transcending identity. Should Black actors, as a matter of pride, limit themselves to characters specifically written as Black? (The great Black playwright August Wilson thought so.) If gay or trans actors made analogous choices, they might not work at all.

That’s changing, slowly. But even as it does, the move to expand the canon, and to open the existing one to people formerly excluded from it, finds itself at odds with a movement to limit access to certain roles. The prohibition against blackface is being extended to more and more “faces.” As of now, those faces are asymmetrical: A Black actor can play a Jew — Adrian Lester played Emanuel Lehman — but not vice versa. There are inarguable political reasons for that asymmetry. Yet should we ever achieve a just society, will we require exact matches between playwright and story, actor and character, critic and production, production and audience, as if making theater were an organ transplant? And what would that mean for the many Black Jews and others whose mix of backgrounds doesn’t fit neatly into casting categories?

We are in what may be the opening years of an identitarian sea change, as various artists focus more overtly and exclusively on ever finer slices of themselves, speaking first to those in precise demographic alignment and only secondarily, if at all, to interested others. (As the chief theater critic for The New York Times, I have been asked not to review certain plays that creative teams apparently felt I, as a white man, could not appreciate.) This is the reverse angle on the ideal that Jews brought to the American stage. For one thing, Jews couldn’t afford to speak only to themselves as they moved uptown from Second Avenue: They may have made up a big part of the audience but only a tiny portion — 2.5 percent — of the U.S. population.

Beyond those commercial considerations are aesthetic and even spiritual ones. Strasberg’s version of the Method calls on actors to develop the habit of emotional recall so they can reach into the lives of characters who may at first seem unfamiliar but upon sympathetic examination reveal likenesses. Radical connectedness is the underlying message: We intersect everyone. This was a necessary skill for Jews (and other outsiders) even beyond the theater. (I am myself, but I am also you.) To confuse that with a rigid inhabitation of one’s own identity is to make a mistake like that of some actors who, misinterpreting the Method, over-inhabit the identity of their characters.

Well, whatever works. But the history of Jews in the American theater has largely been based on the necessity of opening up and looking beyond, instead of suffocating in, the small space of the self. Jewish playwrights have written from within other identities not only to avoid being pigeonholed but also to exercise the muscle of sympathy. Miller’s plays may not have featured many Jewish characters, but Jews in the audience knew how to hear between the lines of the Lomans or, for that matter, the Macbeths, just as Black people have long read themselves into white stories and gay people into straight ones. The details are merely grappling hooks that let us climb into the universal. In so doing, we learn to map the coordinates of our inner dramas against the ones onstage to approximate a fuller truth that neither alone is sufficient to reach. Without triangulation, the world is flat.

THAT’S OUR METHOD. Try to understand everyone. Keep quiet about ourselves. Don’t startle the gentiles.

I say “our,” but there are many kinds of Jews. “How Are Things in the Gemara?” would be no joke to some of them; my temple’s punchline is their holy text. I grew up in a different Jewish tradition, one that was slightly embarrassed about the old country and the old ways. (None of my immigrant grandparents ever wanted to see Eastern Europe again.) Though maintaining a pro forma adherence to Conservative Jewish ritual, we took the interstate to almost total assimilation via its service road, culture. Theater, often as not on Friday night, became our substitute orthodoxy: similarly argumentative, often musical and scholarly, if you were so inclined. I became a critic over whitefish salad.

But however airily we defined our Judaism — like many of us, I call myself a “cultural Jew,” with “cultural” doing at least double duty — we were haunted by the fear that others, when the time came, would omit the adjective and treat us accordingly. What, to the world, was a Jew anyway, having cut off his sidecurls and tossed his fur hat? Certainly not anything worthy of protection as a persistently endangered minority, or even worth seeing, having worked so hard to make himself invisible.

What awakened me to the reality behind that fear was, naturally, “Fiddler on the Roof,” which I saw during the Philadelphia stop of its first national tour, in 1969. I was 10. As the show’s Jews were forced, on three days’ notice, to pack up their belongings and leave their shtetl, I understood that this was more or less my grandparents’ story, the one they whispered about, or flipped into Yiddish, so as not to distress the kinder. Kitsch notwithstanding, I cried all the way home.

It wasn’t just their story that set me bawling. For me, “Fiddler” was a warning that the triumphs of American Jewry as I knew it — Bernstein! Miller! — could be knocked to pieces in no time. I’m sure Stoppard would be horrified to know that, for all its plush sophistication, what shook me at “Leopoldstadt” was precisely the same thing. His Viennese Jews are extremely cultured and yet extremely discreet. They are close with gentiles who share their love for painting, music, literature and, yes, theater (Schnitzler is a plot point) but, in the end, have few friends when the Nazis come knocking. Their lives are dismantled, in minutes not days, and most of them die in the Holocaust.

If “Leopoldstadt” stopped there, I wouldn’t have mixed feelings about it. But after the deportations it jumps to 1955, when Leo, a callow 24-year-old Brit much like young Stoppard — though Stoppard was born Czech, not Austrian — belatedly allows himself to learn the truth of what happened to most of his family. The play ends with a list of the death camps and the relatives who died in them or otherwise in the wake of the Anschluss. Each name is a cudgel pulverizing Leo’s blithe assimilation until he and most of the audience (the show was a hit) are a pile of rubble: “Hermine. Auschwitz. Heini. Auschwitz.” How dare a Jew not center historical trauma at all times!

To its portrait of the perils of complacency, this final scene thus adds a portrait of the egotism of survival. In each case the Jews are somehow to blame. Both the murdered Viennese and the living Stoppard stand-in apparently should have known better. Nor is that perverse idea confined to “Leopoldstadt.” Assimilation is not merely a danger but a moral failing in most contemporary theatrical portraits of Jews. The Lehmans lose their empire as they lose their religion. Ruth Wolff, in “The Doctor,” finds that being a cultural Jew offers her no protection from anti-Semites. (She, not they, is the author of her downfall.) On the other hand, in “Parade,” Leo Frank is carefully established as a hubristic outsider not only to Atlanta’s gentiles but also to its gracious, Southern-fried Jews. If only he’d been more likable! There’s no winning in these plays — but to be fair, there’s no winning in most plays. That’s what makes them plays.

Still, it does seem especially glaring that Jews are unlikely to be Jewish onstage unless they are endangered — literally or, as in “The Doctor,” professionally. Perhaps it’s not surprising, then, that what felt like the fullest theatrical representation of Jewishness among the recent crop of Jewish shows was Edelman’s “Just for Us”: 85 minutes of stand-up about some ineffectual Queens bigots he dismisses as “Nerf Nazis.” The jokes are the delivery system for an ancient anxiety but also the mark of victory over it. (His visit leaves the Nerf Nazis in confused disarray.) So even though he provides his full name — David Yosef Shimon ben Elazar Reuven Alexander Halevi Edelman — for laughs, he is serious (as he told The Times) about exploring the place of Jews on the “spectrum of whiteness without having a conversation about victimhood.”

Comedy may be best placed to have that conversation — and certainly, from Woody Allen and Rivers on, comedians have been having it. A jokefest like “Spamalot,” first seen on Broadway in 2005 and revived this season, can say what others can’t: “You just don’t succeed on Broadway / if you don’t have any Jews.” That’s true offstage, anyway. But perhaps most troubling in the prevailing conversation about Jewishness in the theater is that it’s exclusively concerned with what happens onstage. In fussing over noses and casting, looking to preserve our place on the playbill, we are defending the wrong thing. What Jews need most in the theater today is an enhanced and reciprocal culture of allyship, one acknowledging that Jewish plays and Jewish success do not nullify centuries of monstrous mistreatment or disqualify us from the list of targeted minorities. Our art is safe; it’s we who are not.

The Jewish contribution to the creation of the American theater was built on the acknowledgment of a larger humanity alive within each of us, available to some, with natural empathy and rigorous training. Not perfectly so: Though the gentile members of the cast of “The Lehman Trilogy” were excellent, they didn’t sound very Jewish to a Jew. Likewise, in seeking to dramatize universal conflicts (racism, despotism, violence, pride) by passing them through the lens of specific exoticized cultures, the Jewish gods of the golden age of the American musical — George Gershwin, Jerome Kern and Richard Rodgers among them — often sacrificed accuracy and sensitivity to power and gorgeousness. See: “Porgy and Bess” (1935), “Show Boat” (1927) and “The King and I” (1951). The Irish no doubt resent the leprechaun in “Finian’s Rainbow,” too, and the Scots the heather in “Brigadoon.”

But surely this doesn’t mean we should discourage artists from attempting the greatest thing theater can do: to create liminal spaces that allow us to cross over into new understandings of otherness. Of all people, Jews should recognize the necessity of that. After all, the American theatrical canon — starting in the 1920s for musicals and the 1960s for plays — is disproportionately the work of our tiny minority. For the decades in which the theater remained an important cultural catalyst, “American” and “Jewish” were thus nearly synonymous, not just on Broadway but also in high school dramatic clubs and community Melody Barns. Of course, some of that was because Jews were the gatekeepers, but it was a gate that swung both ways. Jewishness had to become American surreptitiously or by mere osmosis.

The comedian Alex Edelman, the playwright Paula Vogel and the actor and writer Harvey Fierstein share their favorite jokes. Jordan Taylor Fuller

Having thrived on the practice, even when erring, we should now treasure it in others and let them err, too. If in some new golden age of theater we want anyone to play everyone — that’s certainly my dream — we have to begin to be happy with it now. For me, the best thing about last year’s Broadway revival of “Death of a Salesman,” starring Wendell Pierce, wasn’t that it had been finally made Jewish — it hadn’t — but that it had been finally made Black.

If that’s erasure, it’s a complicated, uplifting kind, consistent with Jewish values and habits and the history of Jews in the theater. Why else did Strasberg and Adler and the others create the Method but to open American culture to a people and a vision it had not yet fully welcomed? That their effort proved more influential than they dreamed, teaching the world how to act and creating a new kind of drama to act in, is not a mark of its failure but its success. We can celebrate that success in the names of Broadway theaters: the Friedman, the Jacobs, the Schoenfeld, the Hirschfeld, the Gershwin, the Simon, the Rodgers, the Sondheim. But having given so much to the world, we should let the world take it. And not to worry, we won’t disappear in the process. Brigadoon will still be a shtetl when it wakes up another hundred years hence, and “Glocca Morra” will always be Jewish when you sing it.

WHAT WAS SAID

“There will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration.”

— in a 2020 interview on NPR

In running for the presidency, Mr. Biden made Mr. Trump’s border wall a central part of his campaign. On his first day in office, he issued a proclamation ending the national emergency declaration that had been used to direct resources to building the wall.

But in recent weeks, the Biden administration has eased a variety of laws to allow for the construction of new barriers in Texas along the southwestern border. The move comes as the number of immigrants crossing the border without authorization surges, drastically altering the political pressures on Mr. Biden.

Mr. Biden has maintained his view that a border wall is ineffective. But he said that the funding was appropriated for the border wall in 2019 and that Congress would not re-appropriate it — despite public calls by the administration to do so — meaning the funding had to be used for that purpose. A 1974 law requires the president to spend money as Congress directs, and White House officials have said the only way to potentially get around it was to file a lawsuit, which the administration chose not to do.

Before the recent announcement, the administration authorized the completion of some small wall gaps.

WHAT WAS SAID

“End Trump’s detrimental asylum policies.”

We are both grass eaters, but that’s about the only similarity.” “Some weeks, it feels as though there is a sniper in the trees, picking off people we have loved for years. It breaks your heart, but as Carly Simon sang, there is more room in a broken heart. My heart is the roomiest it has ever been.” “In my experience, most of us age away from brain and ambition toward heart and soul, and we bathe in relief that things are not worse.” (Thanks to Melissa France of Flemington, N.J., and Steve Aldrich of Minneapolis, among others, for nominating passages from Lamott’s essay.)

806,806,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/us/politics/donald-trump-vp.html,"Election 2024 Who Would Donald Trump Choose as His Running Mate?

Donald J. Trump hasn’t won a single primary or caucus vote yet, let alone the Republican nomination, but his lead in the polls has left much of the political world viewing his nomination as all but inevitable.

It has also inspired a fair amount of speculation about who might wind up on a 2024 ticket beside him. It will almost surely not be former Vice President Mike Pence, who crossed Trump by certifying the 2020 election results.

While Trump has not begun formal veepstakes talks, he has casually weighed the pros and cons of some contenders with friends and advisers.

His team has discussed possible parameters, like whether a woman on the ticket would help win back suburban women who abandoned him in the last election, or if choosing a person of color would be a smart choice, given the gains he saw in 2020 with Black and Hispanic men.

Either way, Mar-a-Lago courtiers generally agree that any résumé for the No. 2 spot on the ticket must include some Trump-specific requirements that defy demographics: absolute loyalty to the Trump brand, a willingness to filter every decision and public comment through a subservient lens, and the know-it-when-you-see-it “central casting” look the former president prizes.

Here’s a look at some possible contenders.

The Political veterans Household names in national politics, these are some of the figures most often floated as possible running mates. Tim Scott A senator from South Carolina, Scott ran for president but dropped out in November. Al Drago/EPA, via Shutterstock PROS The only Black Republican in the Senate, he is one of the party’s most prodigious fund-raisers, and one of its most well-liked figures.

Scott has often leaned on his faith, which could help ease evangelicals’ concerns about Trump. Some have been depressed by Trump’s eagerness to blame them for the party's losses in 2022 and by his lack of passion for their anti-abortion priorities. CONS He's not on anyone's list of Trump's most vocal supporters.

He said when he dropped out that he had no intention of endorsing another candidate, but that could always change.

Scott’s inability to produce memorable moments in three primary debates might not bode well for a potential face-off against Vice President Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor. Nikki Haley Haley, a former United Nations ambassador under Trump and a former governor of South Carolina, is running for president against him. Samuel Corum for The New York Times PROS She has proved to be a skillful debater and formidable campaigner.

As her state's first female governor and the nation's second governor of Indian descent, she would diversify a Trump ticket.

Her executive experience on economic issues as governor and her handling of foreign policy issues in Trump's cabinet could prepare her well for a debate with Harris. CONS Trust could be a problem after she endorsed a rival of his in 2016 and entered the 2024 race against him, accusing him of pursuing “chaos, vendettas and drama” and saying a younger president was needed.

Her ambition could spook a man reluctant to share the spotlight.

Trump’s nastiness toward her – he has relentlessly called her “birdbrain” – could be a barrier. Tom Cotton A staunch and provocative conservative, the Arkansas senator has been seen as one of the Republican Party’s rising figures. Doug Mills/The New York Times PROS At 46, he’s three decades younger than Trump.

He’s a decorated military veteran with a substantial foreign policy résumé.

Trump has shown interest in Cotton before: He considered him for a cabinet post. CONS He voted to certify the 2020 presidential election, which has become Trump's most important political litmus test.

He’s a foreign policy hawk, which might not align with Trump’s often isolationist, “America First” views. Marco Rubio The Florida senator, a rival to Trump in 2016, has hummed along as a reliable Trump ally and leading Republican voice on foreign policy issues. Scott McIntyre for The New York Times PROS Experienced on the national stage, Rubio is a known quantity.

His pro-Israel, anti-Putin track record is particularly timely.

He is a fluent Spanish speaker, and his Cuban heritage figures prominently in his political bio.

Rubio and Trump have quietly had a close relationship for years. Before Trump was voted out of the White House in 2020, he was considering Rubio as a possible secretary of state nominee. CONS Rubio has never quite fulfilled the expectations that many Republicans held for him — and that he helped stoke — after his underdog Senate victory in 2010.

He very publicly said he didn’t want to be considered for Trump’s ticket in 2016.

What could disqualify him is the central role he played in a 2013 immigration overhaul effort that, even a decade later, remains anathema to the Republican base. Mike Pompeo Pompeo, a former congressman from Kansas, was a fixture in the Trump administration, first as C.I.A. director and then as secretary of state. Al Drago for The New York Times PROS He has more high-level experience than most of the other contenders.

He would provide geographic balance as a Midwestern presence on the Republican ticket. CONS In his memoir about his time in the administration, Pompeo criticized the former president’s handling of Vladimir V. Putin, said Trump had a “nutty” plan to put him in charge of the Departments of Defense and State, and revealed that tough talk about China had upset Trump.

Pompeo had considered a 2024 presidential campaign, which Trump viewed as a sign of disloyalty. Before deciding not to run, he publicly warned Republicans to move on from “celebrity leaders” with “fragile egos.”

The Loyalists For any potential Trump sidekick, a track record of accomplishments is nice to have. A track record of fealty may be even more important. J.D. Vance The best-selling author and former venture capitalist is now a senator from Ohio, thanks largely to a Trump endorsement. Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times PROS He and Trump resolved their differences and have become particularly close.

Vance is one of Trump’s most vigorous defenders, which sets him apart in a Senate populated with skeptics of the former president.

Both are immigration hard-liners who also share similar views on trade. CONS He’s much younger than Trump, but he wouldn’t add any gender or ethnic diversity to the ticket.

Ohio is no longer a presidential battleground.

Vance is fiercely anti-abortion, which could add to the party’s difficulties on that issue. Sarah Huckabee Sanders Trump’s former White House press secretary, she parlayed the exposure that gave her into the Arkansas governor’s office. Doug Mills/The New York Times PROS She is a young, female Republican who is widely well-regarded in the party.

She learned the ins and outs of the West Wing while becoming a MAGA star as the administration’s lead spokeswoman.

She endorsed Trump in November. CONS Trump resented that it took her a year to endorse his 2024 campaign.

A minor scandal in Arkansas over the purchase of a $19,000 lectern was the sort of unforced error that presidential campaigns try to avoid. Kristi Noem A popular governor and a former congresswoman, Noem has welcomed speculation that she could be invited to join the ticket. Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times PROS A telegenic Midwesterner, Noem could help connect with suburban women in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states where Mike Pence spent much of his time in 2016.

A two-term governor, she has a record of economic accomplishments in her state that could resonate with voters in 2024. CONS She is untested on the national stage.

She has close ties to Corey Lewandowski, the longtime on-again, off-again Trump adviser, whose brushes with the law have generated unwelcome headlines for Team Trump. John Ratcliffe A former House member from Texas who served as the director of national intelligence in Trump’s administration. Doug Mills/The New York Times PROS A former prosecutor, Ratcliffe made a name for himself grilling Peter Strzok, an F.B.I. agent, over text messages mocking Trump before the 2016 election. Trump still talks about those texts on the campaign trail.

He was rated as the most conservative legislator in Texas by the Heritage Foundation.

He remains close to Trump and would be viewed as a solid choice for the position. CONS He turned down a chance to become attorney general when Trump approached him about the position after the 2020 election.

He warned the Trump White House team against trying to overturn the 2020 election, according to one staff member’s sworn testimony to Congress.

He is not so well known among Trump supporters that his presence on the ticket would energize the base. Kari Lake Lake, a prominent election denier, narrowly lost the 2022 Arizona governor’s race. Rebecca Noble for The New York Times PROS Few Republicans have emulated Trump’s signature style of confrontational politics better than Lake.

A former Phoenix local news anchor, she delivers a polished presentation of her far-right agenda.

She came within a percentage point of winning statewide in Arizona, one of the country’s top presidential battlegrounds. CONS Lake’s Trump impression might be a little too inspired. He is loath to share any of the attention that comes his way, let alone risk being eclipsed.

Adding her to the ticket would combine two of the party's most divisive figures.

She and Trump have exactly one electoral victory between them. Vivek Ramaswamy A wealthy entrepreneur, Ramaswamy has built his campaign around his devotion to Trump, and many Republican voters have responded warmly. Kenny Holston/The New York Times PROS Youthful and energetic, Ramaswamy could be a potent surrogate for Trump, who will spend much of 2024 tied up in court defending himself on criminal charges.

No presidential contender has been more eager to praise Trump from the debate stage, on social media or on the campaign trail.

Trump has returned the adoration, saying in August that he thought Ramaswamy would make a “very good” V.P. pick. CONS He has no previous political experience.

He has irritated both Republican leaders and voters: Polls show that those with unfavorable opinions of him outnumber those with favorable opinions.

He’s relatively untested and unvetted compared with some of the other contenders.

The Up-and-Comers Lesser known on the national stage, these politicians could provide the ticket with a fresh face. Byron Donalds A second-term congressman who has made a name for himself in Washington as an avatar for the next generation of pro-Trump Republicans. Erin Schaff/The New York Times PROS He is one of the party’s relatively few Black officeholders and would add racial diversity to the ticket at a time when Republicans are seeking to draw Black voters away from Democrats.

Trump has taken notice of Donalds and has spoken admiringly of him to advisers. CONS He is relatively inexperienced as a politician.

He ran unsuccessfully for House speaker against Kevin McCarthy, who had Trump’s endorsement.

Donalds had some run-ins with law enforcement two decades ago, including a bribery charge to which he pleaded no contest. He has said that he learned from the experience, describing what he did as the “actions of a young kid.” Elise Stefanik ​​Stefanik, a five-term congresswoman, has morphed from a Bush administration staff member into one of the party’s most prominent Trump supporters. Hans Pennink/Associated Press PROS A 39-year-old woman and rising Republican, Stefanik would bring youth and gender diversity to a ticket with the septuagenarian Trump.

She has a proven ability to reinvent herself as the political moment necessitates. CONS Her devotion to Trump may be surpassed only by her own political ambition. There’s room for only one personal brand at Mar-a-Lago.

She’s from New York, which despite Republican gains remains a solidly blue state. Tudor Dixon Dixon, a conservative media personality, lost the 2022 governor’s race in Michigan to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat. Brittany Greeson for The New York Times PROS A young, charismatic woman from a battleground state, Dixon would check a lot of boxes for Trump. Betting markets are also high on her.

She proudly highlighted a Trump endorsement during her 2022 campaign. CONS Dixon was trounced by 10 percentage points in 2022. Trump likes winners.

She has taken positions on abortion that some party leaders, including Trump, now view as out of touch with voters. Nancy Mace A House member from South Carolina who was the first female military recruit to graduate from the Citadel. Kenny Holston/The New York Times PROS She enjoys a large media profile and has openly expressed interest in joining the ticket.

Mace largely aligns with Trump on social issues, and has cautioned her party against going too far in restricting access to abortion.

She’s politically pliable: hailed as a moderate by some, a pro-Trump warrior by others. CONS She strongly condemned Trump for the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot and has said he should be held accountable.

Trump recruited a primary challenger to run against her last year, and it’s unclear if they have made amends.

She hasn’t yet endorsed Trump’s latest presidential bid. Wesley Hunt A freshman in the House and a retired Army Apache helicopter pilot, he has become one of the party’s rising stars. Suzanne Cordeiro/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images PROS Hunt is another young Black Republican seen as having a bright future, and tells a powerful personal story about growing up in a family of staunch Democrats.

He endeared himself to Trump on the 2024 trail in Iowa by remaining in the state for several days after the campaign had left in order to stump on Trump’s behalf. CONS He isn’t on many lists of potential Trump V.P.s, but neither was Mike Pence.

His inexperience may not reassure voters who are nervous about Trump's advanced age."

From New York Times Opinion, this is “The Ezra Klein Show.” On Nov. 5, The New York Times and Siena College released this poll that freaked the Democrats out like nothing I’ve seen this cycle. The poll showed Trump up in five of the six key battleground states, showed him benefiting from a huge shift in nonwhite and young voters in his favor. And it set off a complete round of Democratic panic. Biden, it seemed, was just uniquely weak. Then, on Nov. 7, we had this big bunch of elections. And Democrats did really well. In Kentucky, Democrat Andy Beshear held the governor’s mansion. In Virginia, Democrats took back the House of Delegates. In Ohio, they got a constitutional amendment protecting abortion. It felt a lot like 2022, when Biden was polling poorly and everybody predicted a Democratic wipeout, but Democrats did far better in the midterms than anybody expected. Well, they did better, I guess I should say, than almost anybody expected. But Michael Podhorzer, he did expect it. Podhorzer was a longtime political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. He’s kind of a legend in Democratic campaign circles. He founded this thing called the Analyst Institute, which was the nerve center of the data-driven empirical turn in Democratic campaign strategies. Now he writes a Substack on these topics called Weekend Reading, which is a descendant of an influential email he used to send out to top campaign strategists. And he never thought 2022 was going to be a wipeout for Democrats. He doesn’t think Biden’s bad polls are revealing much right now. He thinks the whole way the media thinks about polling is wrong. He calls it “mad poll disease,” and it drives him a little nuts. He often vents that frustration to me. I’m a nearby member of the media to him. So I invited him on the show to get his take on how Biden looks going into 2024, whether Democrats are making a huge mistake by sidestepping a primary, and what it will take to reconstitute the anti-MAGA coalition we saw in 2020 and 2022. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. .[MUSIC PLAYING] Michael Podhorzer, welcome to the show.

michael podhorzer

Hi, Ezra. Glad to be here.

ezra klein

So I want to begin chronologically. I asked you to come on the show after this big New York Times / Siena poll, showing Trump beating Biden in five to six key swing states. That poll set off a huge panic among Democrats. You think or thought, I think it is fair to say, that panic was stupid. Why?

michael podhorzer

For several reasons. The most important one is that a poll taken today, especially in 2023, really doesn’t tell us anything about November 2024 that we don’t already know. The national election is going to be really close. No poll even on the day of the election after millions of people have voted gets that right reliably. Over and over again, whether it’s the midterms or some of the elections that just happened, the media looking at the poll doesn’t understand what Americans do, that it’s different when they cast a ballot than when they answer a survey. That when they answer a survey, it’s an opportunity to express their frustration, their disappointment, which is obviously the case about how people feel about this administration. And it comes out in lots of other polls. But then when they actually have to go and vote and actually look at the choice, it doesn’t match. But that isn’t really how it gets interpreted and written up.

ezra klein

Let me try to defend poll panic here for a minute. Not my natural position, but I want to give it voice.

michael podhorzer

Sure.

ezra klein

So the thing people say is, look, fair enough. The polls isn’t predictive. We actually know that polls a year out from an election are not predictive. They have no better than a monkey throwing a dart accuracy. But it is a snapshot, and it’s telling us things that need to be taken seriously. And the thing specifically that it’s telling us is Joe Biden is a uniquely weak candidate. According to the FiveThirtyEight polling average, his favorability rating is 38.5. It’s not great. If you look at the New York Times / Siena poll, he’s seeing — and I think this is both the most striking and, to me, the most questionable aspect of the poll — double digit erosion among young voters and among Black voters. I mean, if that happens, he is toast. And so there are some unique Joe Biden problem. The poll is a snapshot, but the snapshot should make Democrats panic and dump Joe Biden. That would be my case for polling panic.

michael podhorzer

Yeah. Well, there’s nothing in the New York Times survey that people who can do anything about whether Joe Biden is on the ticket don’t already know. There’s a massive amount of polling always going on in the Democratic Party, in the Republican Party, in the groups that work with them. There’s no news in that survey that is a surprise to people who are doing this professionally. This is known.

ezra klein

But I think the concern people have, the concern I hear from Democrats, and including from some elite Democrats, is that the Democratic Party is whistling past the graveyard. You believe, and we’re going to talk about this at some length, that Donald Trump poses a unique threat to American democracy, that Donald Trump getting re-elected in 2024 is a cataclysm of genuinely historic dimensions. And if that’s true, if you believe that’s true, then you really want to go into 2024 with your strongest candidate. And if elite Democrats, informed Democrats, if people with the power to make decisions in this space, people who you’ve been in these circles forever, if they’re refusing to admit what is right in front of their face because maybe it’s bad for their career, maybe it’s socially awkward, maybe they don’t want to be the first one to stick their head up, although some have — I mean, David Axelrod, who is Obama’s chief strategist, has kind of said pretty clearly he thinks Biden should step down and not run again. Not step down from the presidency, but from the campaign. Are those Democratic elites you’re talking about making a terrible mistake right now that is being revealed in this and other polls?

michael podhorzer

I think that this is the kind of original sin mistake, which happened after Sanders won the Nevada caucus. And suddenly, Biden wins everywhere. He’s the nominee, even though about 10 minutes before, he looked really weak. And the things that made him look weak in early 2020, to a certain extent, haven’t gone. But once you’ve been president for three years and there’s a whole infrastructure around you, and there really isn’t time — and here’s where I think it’s really unrealistic — to figure out who the next one is. And so while I wish we weren’t in a position where we are right now, I think that it’s the least bad place.

ezra klein

So something you suggest there is that Democratic elites just don’t really have time or didn’t have time to do something else here. And that doesn’t feel really true. I mean, it’s still possible for your Gavin Newsoms of the world to go onto the ballot. It does seem, and I mean, people in the party have said this, that there has been a push to close ranks behind Joe Biden. And I guess the question I have for you is, has that been the right strategy? There was a lot of time. This was not — nobody lost time on the watch. They made a choice. And people are scared they made the wrong choice. Do you think they made the wrong choice?

michael podhorzer

I feel like that’s something no one could really have an idea on. I don’t offer that kind of advice. I think it’s a gamble. And without knowing what the odds on the gamble were, how do you sort of answer that question?

ezra klein

I do think that is a little bit underplayed in this, sometimes, that going with Biden is dangerous. I mean, going with an 80-year-old candidate has risks who’s not very popular. And starting up a primary either against the incumbent president or having him step down when his vice president is not that politically strong also could fracture the party. And so I also don’t — I’ve felt that other people seem more certain on what Democrats should have done here than I am, but I could see it going wrong both ways. But the fact that it goes wrong one way doesn’t mean it also wouldn’t have gone wrong in the other. Now let me flip the role I’m taking in this, because I’ve looked at polling at about this state in the race, about the state in the presidency for Trump, for Obama, for Clinton, for George W. Bush. And the thing that strikes me about it is that if all I knew were the polls, nothing I’m seeing with Joe Biden looks that weird. I made a mistake. I didn’t bring these numbers in with me. But Mitt Romney was leading Barack Obama in polling in 2011. Hillary Clinton was dominating, absolutely stomping Donald Trump and Jeb Bush in polling. You can go back to Reagan’s first term. You can go back to Obama’s first term. You look at their approval ratings in the third year. They’re not great. Depending on when you’re looking, they’re a little bit higher. You can argue Biden is underperforming them by a point or two. But they now look like incredibly successful politicians. But in year three, they didn’t seem that way. In fact, Barack Obama, in year three, so didn’t seem that way, that his campaign polled taking Joe Biden off of the ticket and replacing him with the electoral juggernaut of Hillary Clinton. And so I think the thing here that is sometimes hard for me to tell is whether incumbents in their third year just kind of look a little rough before the whole artillery of the campaign comes into play, or there’s something distinctive about Joe Biden maybe related to his age and doubts voters have about that or something else about him that puts him in a weaker position, such that the rebound we have seen with other presidents is not as likely for him.

michael podhorzer

Yeah, I’m glad you brought that in because that sounds a little bit self-serving coming from me, but it’s true. Right now, a lot of people taking those surveys are expressing their disappointment with the way the world is, not thinking about what the world might look like in 2025. And that was true in all of the third years you’re talking about. It’s in the DNA to have higher expectations for the person you’re going to elect then gets met. And so I think there was a lot of unrealistic expectations generated.

ezra klein

But why are people so disappointed right now? I mean, Biden’s bad polling, his sort of drop to the low 40s, high 30s, it predates both Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and very much predates the Hamas’s attacks and the war in Gaza. And if you look around, for a while, the explanation was inflation. But inflation has been coming down. The labor market is actually pretty damn strong and has been that way for a while. Wages are pretty good. You wouldn’t think people would be so pissed at the system. I mean, COVID has calmed. Compared to where we were just a couple of years ago, this feels like recovery. This feels like — I don’t want to say feels like, because clearly, it doesn’t feel like. But if you looked at the numbers, you could really make a case for morning in America. So why are people so pissed?

michael podhorzer

Because they’re not the right numbers to be looking at. There’s just the collapse in confidence in American institutions generally. And that has been happening for the last 20 years, at least. Whoever is president is actually the head of one of those institutions that people have lost faith in, which is why for 3/4 of the time for Bush, Obama, Trump, and, Biden their approval ratings have been underwater, except during the 9/11 bump and in the first couple of months after they get elected. That is just the permanent state of presidential approval in the 21st century. And so we’re not seeing a different thing, really. On the numbers. I think that this is one of those situations where there’s sort of zombie heuristics, things like GDP growth. That used to be a really good number because prosperity was shared. So if GDP was going up, then you could be reasonably sure most people were feeling it. But the less that that prosperity is shared, the less good indicator it is. Also, in this period, the kinds of things that really matter to working people have gotten a lot worse in terms of how much more precarious their employment is. So if you make, say, 10 percent or 15 percent more, but you don’t know what your hours are going to be next week, you don’t know whether you’ll have a job in seven months, you don’t feel like someone telling you you’ve just got a 15 percent raise is the whole story. And similarly, if you have a family, if you don’t feel like you’re going to be able to help your kids get a better life, that’s just not going to be overcome by this month’s unemployment numbers. And I think inflation is another area where there’s this kind of data mismatch. Inflation coming down is still rising prices. And if you’re in the bottom 3/4, that’s an immense burden. That’s, I think, hard for people in this bubble to really appreciate, that unlike a lot of other problems, inflation is one that is in your head all the time, because you don’t know whether you’re going to have enough money for the prices that are going to be next month. And so you just spend all this time and mental overhead that’s unlike a more abstract problem.

ezra klein

I want to spend another moment on the Democratic weakness and Biden’s weakness among young voters and voters of color. The swing in the Times / Siena poll is huge. And so I get the point that it seems unlikely that would persist through an election. But we’ve been seeing rising Republican support among nonwhite voters for a bit. Biden’s polling troubles among young voters have also been persistent. Something real is happening here among two of the constituencies Democrats think of as most reliable for them. And it’s consistent across enough polls that I think it should be taken seriously. So what do you make of it?

michael podhorzer

I think that it is less about Trump becoming more popular and about the lack of enthusiasm and disappointment that especially young voters feel for Biden. One thing that I think most people probably can relate to is that often, if you age into the electorate at a time that John Kennedy becomes president, or that Ronald Reagan becomes president, or that Barack Obama became president, that age cohort becomes very much attached to that political party. We’re in this unusual place where the people coming of age are negatively seeing that. They are coming of age in a way that they are turned off by Trump, but not turned on by Biden or other Democrats.

ezra klein

How about the nonwhite vote?

michael podhorzer

I think that there’s a sort of academic or political observer expectation that whether people will vote for Democrats or Republicans is determined by someone’s race. And I think it’s much more the case that it’s determined by whether the campaign is making salient issues that threaten that group identity. And one of the most misunderstood things about the Latino vote between 2016 and 2020, where there was this enormous drop for support between Hillary Clinton and for Joe Biden, is that there wasn’t much change in the support for Joe Biden from House Democrats in 2016. But if you remember, in 2016, going after Trump’s hostility to Mexican immigrants was something she talked about a lot. It was something that she did advertising on that other Democrats weren’t, and that among Latino voters immigration was one of the top issues in multiple polls. It was in the air. And that activated a Latino identity. Joe Biden had a different strategy, which was to try not to go near that. But there are tradeoffs, right? There’s a way in which people who comment on politics don’t realize almost everything has a tradeoff. The tradeoff of being quiet about activating group identities is that people in that group start to vote for different reasons. There’s a great book called “Steadfast Democrats” that talks about how the Black vote is always so high because that’s the only socially acceptable vote in that community because you always are Black in America. But I think Latinos are more like every immigrant group before it. And if you don’t feel threatened, then if you are conservative, the reasons you voted for the House Republican in 2016, but voted for Clinton, that’s a lot of what’s going on.

ezra klein

And so in this theory, there would actually be a connection between why Joe Biden did better among white voters in 2020, which was a very important margin in him winning and why he’s doing and did somewhat worse among non-white voters. The media focused on what he lost, but you’re actually saying they made a trade.

michael podhorzer

Absolutely. If you look at Obama ‘12, Clinton ‘16, and Biden, they all ran about two points ahead of House Democrats. But Obama and Clinton did it by doing much better than House Democrats with Latinos and Blacks and worse with whites. And Biden, it was sort of two points, whichever group you were in. And that may have been part of the success, but it’s a problem that the stories are only that there are losses. There are tradeoffs here.

ezra klein

So something that you said now a few times, the numbers we’re seeing here are not that unusual. People are just mad. Presidents are typically now underwater, have been for some time. It’s been noted by political scientists that performance of the economy is decoupling from presidential approval. That was true for a bit now, too, and that maybe Biden’s age, which I think most of us take as a real potential weakness for him. But I wonder sometimes if it doesn’t almost act as cover to make a normal situation look abnormal. Because Biden’s age is actually somewhat abnormal for a president, that creates a kind of “maybe this time is different.” Maybe what we’re seeing is more serious. But if you weren’t looking at it that way, maybe it all looks normal. And something else that I think possibly adds into that sense is that if you look internationally, the leaders of peer countries are very unpopular. So my colleague, David Brooks, had a column, where he says, Biden’s 40 percent approval rating may look bad, but in Canada, Justin Trudeau’s approval rating is 36 percent. In Germany, Olaf Scholz is at 29. In Britain, Rishi Sunak is at 28. In France, Emmanuel Macron is at 23. And in Japan, Fumio Kishida is also at 23. Now these other leaders are not 80. So something is happening that leaders who are in the center left and center right across a pretty wide array of countries are not popular. In fact, Joe Biden is the cleanest shirt in a dirty laundry there.

michael podhorzer

That’s absolutely right. And I think that matches what I was trying to express, is that there is a sort of baseline dissatisfaction with the way the world’s going and all of these places. And polling makes it easy to attach that disaffection to a particular person you ask about and ignore that it’s really about everything, and that you couldn’t put someone else in and have people suddenly forget all the things that are making them grumpy about the world today. But the act of making it seem like if this could all change if we just had a different person at the top of this is fantasy. It’s just fantasy. And that’s part of why I think it’s a real problem that important media institutions support the idea that our problems are as superficial as who we put on the ballot as different human beings, when we need to solve the underlying institutional problems. .[MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

We’ve been talking about the polling, and this was what was on my mind when I sent the invitation to you. Then there was an election night last Tuesday, and Democrats did pretty damn well, just as they did pretty damn well in 2022, in a way that maybe, if you had been looking at least broad national polling, how people feel about Joe Biden, how they feel about the country, you wouldn’t think the incumbent party, politically, at least the broadly incumbent party politically, would be surviving that. So what did you make of the 2023 specials we just saw?

michael podhorzer

Pretty much the same as you did, that people understand, can distinguish what’s at stake when they actually are deciding who they want than when they’re answering surveys. And there’s no real stakes. But when the media takes those answers as a profound truth, it misses what’s — there’s just evidence piling up over and over and over again, right? It’s like the 2 plus 2 keeps equaling 4, but they keep hoping it’s going to equal 3. And the problem is that this should be telling us they’re not really mathematicians, right? Because it’s like every time you roll out a new number, numbers just do something to people, right? If someone just got up and said, I think Biden won’t do well, it has a different effect than when someone says, I think he’s going to lose by 4 points or something or 4.5. That’s, I think —

ezra klein

Well, I think versus I have a representative national sample or a sample I have turned representative through methodical demographic weighting are, to be fair, different ideas.

michael podhorzer

I don’t think so. The —

ezra klein

Make this argument because you’ve made this argument, and there’s some truth to it, I think, that polling is a kind of punditry. Why do you say that?

michael podhorzer

Right, it’s a different kind of opinion journalism now. There was a time before phone response rates went so down that there was some scientific basis to it. It was just basically probability theory. But now, there’s no such thing as an actual random sample anymore.

ezra klein

And just to draw this out, the thing happening here at the end of the game in polling is that the pollsters are making a prediction about who will come out to vote. And so they’re taking their interviews and then trying to make the demographics of their interviews. If you think you have half as many Hispanics in your sample as you believe will be in the electorate, then you have to upweight the Hispanics in your sample. But so every pollster is making maybe an informed guess, but a guess about who will show up at the polls in the next election. And without making that guess, those polls don’t mean anything.

michael podhorzer

Correct. So to me, one of the best pieces of data journalism ever was in The New York Times.

ezra klein

It’s a great paper.

michael podhorzer

It is — sometimes. In September 2016, when there was another time survey of Clinton versus Trump in Florida, and really genius, the 850 or so interviews were given blind to really respected pollsters, pollsters who don’t do spin, people who are serious, in the middle, some on the left and the right. And the estimates, I think, were Clinton plus 4, Clinton plus 3, two plus 1’s, and Trump plus 1, right? These are literally the same 850 interviews. And it’s in that arithmetic that everyone should see that yeah, they’re all making a good faith effort to tell you what those 850 interviews mean, but they’re not science anymore.

ezra klein

There is a real and I think reasonable given what we traditionally think about as a relationship between midterm performance and the president’s approval rating belief that you would have a just gigantic red wave in 2022, that it would be a historic wipeout for Democrats. Inflation was terrible in 2022. I mean, it was really bad, and people blamed Joe Biden for it. And then he just didn’t. Democrats did well in the Senate and kept it against many people’s expectations. They held losses down quite a bit in the House. They didn’t do that badly across governorships. Why?

michael podhorzer

MAGA. Because the way politics works in this country now has changed radically since Trump was elected. And coverage is pretty much what you just described, where you just expect that red wave because it’s always been that way, right? And so when you do polling, whatever you’re doing, you just are subject to a lot of confirmation bias until it’s disabused at the polls, right? Voters have been making the choice of MAGA, no MAGA, for several cycles now. They know what’s at stake.

ezra klein

So when you say MAGA, you mean Trumpist candidates, the kinds of candidates who buy into his lies about 2020, or prior to 2020, the kinds of candidates who align themselves with, say, the Trump faction of the party or his presidency over what you might think of as traditional Republican candidates.

michael podhorzer

Correct. 20 years ago, if Herschel Walker had been on the ballot, he would have been wiped out, right? He had just so many negatives, so many things that people probably wouldn’t ever countenance in that state. And yet he almost won. And even though I think John Fetterman is great, right, and an important senator now, imagine 20 years ago, a candidate having a stroke win as comfortably as he did, because people understood that it wasn’t just about who Pennsylvania’s junior senator was going to be. They know this is closer to a parliamentary decision than it is weigh the two candidates. Because Trump won and because of Dobbs, voters now understand that there’s more to the difference than rhetoric.

ezra klein

So people hate it when I say this. They hate it. But I’m a party polarization guy, and I believe it. In most elections that are national, right, how Senate, to some degree, presidency, though not only, voters would, in general, have more information if you took the candidates’ names off the ballot because in many ways, the candidates’ efforts using consultants and polling and ads and whatever to create idiosyncratic personal profiles built on their biography, built on which kind of dog they have at home, their family’s story, et cetera, actually distracts from the fact that the most important vote they cast, specifically House and Senate, is for the leaders of the chamber. And I used to say that 10 years ago, and people just loathed it. But what you’re saying is that voters increasingly act that way anyway.

michael podhorzer

Absolutely. Yeah, don’t count me as a hater here. I mean, I wish that was the case. If that was the case, we would not have had a Republican majority in the House because if you think about the way in which every Senate race was covered as, will Democrats or Republicans control the Senate, then you think about how the House races were covered, where that never came in.

ezra klein

So the states that understood themselves as in a national election, right, understood themselves as doing something that would really matter for control, treated it that way, and Democrats held on, and the states that didn’t — I mean, California, the narrative in California was, eh, it’s California, right?

michael podhorzer

Right.

ezra klein

Like, who cares? Democrats win in California. People didn’t really seem very to feel very empowered there and also weren’t treated that way in campaign spending.

michael podhorzer

Right. I think, but again —

ezra klein

Pennsylvania got blanketed.

michael podhorzer

Yeah, it’s that, but it’s also that the media, essentially, is one of your haters because they really want to preserve this Democratic folk myth that we should be looking at the two individual candidates and watch how they debate and do all of those kinds of things, rather than contextualizing those House races as leading to Kevin McCarthy and then Mike Johnson. That was in nobody’s narrative ahead of the election.

ezra klein

Well, I think that’s a little too far. I think the idea that these House races would affect control of the House was not actually a secret the media kept, but I do take your point. People all over the country knew all about John Fetterman and Dr. Oz. And that doesn’t really happen in House races, which I think has a real effect. I do think the deterioration of local media and the nationalization of the media lowers the bandwidth for people to kind of see the stakes and the intensity and what matters in their local elections, in a way that’s a genuine problem.

michael podhorzer

So 100 percent that that is true, and that is a very, very big problem. And where it becomes more consequential is in a more subtle way, which is sort of dictating coverage, what’s important to cover. So in a lot of the stories about the elections in New York, in October of ‘22, they were about crime and about inflation. But when especially big institutions like The New York Times say, well, this poll says voters are not caring as much about abortion and about inflation as they were because this one poll told us that, you know that has an effect on every assignment desk in the mainstream media. Oh, we’re not going to do another story about election deniers. We’re going to do the next one about people at grocery stores or whatever. And it has a ripple effect.

ezra klein

Let’s talk about abortion for a second because I think one way of explaining a fair amount of Democratic performance since 2020, explaining what happened in 2022, explaining, to some degree, what happened in 2023 on Tuesday, is simply to say Dobbs, and that Dobbs took the salience of abortion and the stakes of what it means for Republicans to be in charge and turned, at least on that issue, which is a very important issue for people, turned that from an abstraction to a tangible, real, lived experience. I mean, people are now living — and I think this is often underplayed. Like, people are living in the post-Dobbs world. I mean, women in red states are living in states where abortion is criminalized, and that fundamentally, it’s like not all this anti-MAGA stuff necessarily. It’s Dobbs, and really, the key thing the Democrats are doing is running on abortion.

michael podhorzer

So this is a both/and for me. I think that it is about the immediate effects on people’s lives because of Roe being reversed, but more broadly than that, it’s a kind of shock to the system that all the things that Republicans had been talking about wanting to do wasn’t just rhetoric, that given the chance, they would do it. So your issue doesn’t have to be abortion to be affected by Dobbs. You’re going to hear what a Republican politician says now differently than before Dobbs because now you can’t discount it as just appealing to their base. They’re going to do it.

ezra klein

So I want to now open up into the broad Michael Podhorzer view of the world in elections and what Democrats should do. And there is a school of thought. Sometimes it gets called popularism, has different names, but it’s a long running school of thought among Democrats that the problem with Democrats is that they are a bit too liberal and specifically don’t talk enough about the things that they do that people like, which are usually their more moderate accomplishments and not only. Your view has been that that’s missing the point, and that there is this anti-MAGA majority out there, and that strategy should flow from the question of how you activate that majority, which we know exists because we saw it show up in 2020, saw at least parts of it show up in 2022 unexpectedly. So let me start with this question. Just demographically, what is the anti-MAGA majority? How is it different than just Democratic voters?

michael podhorzer

Right, I don’t think it has a demographic basis. And I really think thinking about the electorate in demographic terms is one of the biggest liabilities of the current conversation because right now, for the most part, when we look at how demographic X is voting, it’s a reflection of how many people who don’t like MAGA or love MAGA fall into that demographic. If I say white non-college voter, probably everybody listening to this thinks of like a burly guy, Bob, in a Wisconsin diner who gets interviewed over and over again and seems pretty Trumpy. Bob is the guy that the populists want to win over. But if you pull the camera back from that interview, first, you see Charlene, who’s reaching over the counter and pouring his coffee. And Charlene is really upset about Dobbs. She’d been an infrequent voter, but now she’s going to be out again. And then you pull the camera back further, and you see three 20-somethings sitting in a booth who don’t trust anything any politician ever tells them. They haven’t had a regular job yet. There’s an ambient anxiety about all the things that could go wrong. And now one or two of them, because their friends says so, decides to vote. That’s the anti-MAGA majority. It’s not particularly demographic. They were all white non-college voters. But they have a different place in the world, and they have a different perspective. And other than Bob’s, they feel threatened by Trump and by what his allies want to do.

ezra klein

If Donald Trump is truly so unappealing to people — and he is a very known quantity, right? He is not the unknown governor of Missouri who’s got a fast rise in the Republican Party right now. People really do know he’s under a bazillion indictments. People really do know that there was this thing that happened on January 6, where he and others tried to execute a coup of the government. And Trump’s staying power, the fact that he’s risen up in, let’s call it snapshot polling, right, polling of just how people are answering today, yeah, maybe they’d make a different decision if they were really in the ballot booth, but I think a lot of people hope to see Trump polling at 34 percent now, right, after the last couple of years. And instead, he’s polling ahead of Joe Biden, and that is making them wonder, maybe that anti-MAGA majority isn’t there anymore. Maybe some things about Trump have faded into a kind of nostalgia. People like the economy better. They don’t really like Joe Biden. And as such, if that was there, then he wouldn’t be polling so high. And the fact that he’s polling so high means that is no longer there. How do you think about that?

michael podhorzer

So one of the things that most accurately predicted Trump’s disapproval numbers going down when he was president is if, for some reason, he was out of the news.

ezra klein

Yes.

michael podhorzer

And right now, he is actually relatively out of the news. The thing that people can’t completely accomplish is think about how they will be thinking about this after four trials, after a possible conviction, after an October where he’s just on the front of everything all the time.

ezra klein

I would frame that a little bit differently. I think the one thing Donald Trump is not is out of the news. I mean, if you go to The New York Times on any day lately, it’s a toss-up on whether or not Donald Trump trials or the war in Gaza is leading the page. What I do think is that people are not hearing from him directly anymore that much. In a weird way, one of the best things to happen to Trump was getting banned from every major social media service and then him deciding to stick to Truth Social, rather than go back to X now that he is unbanned because I do think when Donald Trump is talking directly to people, that is very exciting for his people, but for a lot of other people, it’s very, very, very upsetting and creates a very powerful backlash effect. And at the same time, to just basically reiterate the question or poke at you a little bit more on it, it implies people are very short memoried, to say that after the intensity of the experience that the Donald Trump presidency was and how known a quantity he is, that all of these people who have suddenly started saying, yeah, I would vote for that guy again, or I would vote for that guy at all, have just forgotten the vibes that Donald Trump creates in them when he actually has access to his phone and a full suite of apps.

michael podhorzer

So I think a really good poke because I think it helps bring another aspect of this out that we were talking about before, about this being bigger than individual candidates, right? That there are really, especially over the last dozen years since the 2010 election, half of the country has been going in the opposite direction from the other half of the country in big ways, whether it’s, you get a higher minimum wage, you don’t. You can have abortion, you can’t. Up and down the line, state legislates that they’ve become different worlds to live in. And that’s the baseline for it being so close, is now it’s not just, do I think we should go this direction or that direction? It’s, do I want to keep what I have or lose it because the other party now is in charge nationally? And that’s what gets him from 34 to 42 or 43 or whatever it is.

ezra klein

Let me give you my personal explanation for some of this. You do a lot of media criticism on your Substack in your conversations with me. You’re not always a fan of our reporting. But one of my views is that the single biggest divide in media and politics is not left, right. It’s interested, uninterested. And that the people who are not that interested in politics have actually become functionally unimaginable to the people who are. Like, how much you can really not know about politics, not care, how distant it can really be from your life, if you never read the news, which is true for a whole lot of people, even a whole lot of people who vote really, really rarely come into contact, much less choose to come into contact with political news. I think a lot of when I read you, a lot of things come down to the media should cover this thing differently. But the experience of being in the media is that for a lot of the people who you might care if they read that we were covering a thing differently, like they are persuadable, they are soft in their views, we’re not reaching them. They’re not coming to the home page. They’re not looking for editorials to see what we think about things and what the level of stridency is. And that the big, unsolved question actually for everybody, whether you’re a popularist, whether you’re an anti-MAGA, how do you reach people you’re not reaching? Like, how does a message get to somebody who hates politics and hates the news and doesn’t care what any of us are saying, and weirdly, doesn’t even listen to this podcast?

michael podhorzer

It’s unimaginable.

ezra klein

As hard as it is to believe.

michael podhorzer

Yeah, I think that is a really, really important question. And I agree that most people really would rather not hear the news at all and do not go searching it out. And this is also, just to sweep it back in, part of what was my critique of popularism, is it depends on the belief that if a politician says something, someone will hear it and believe it. And that just is not the world we live in. But what does happen is that the media, especially an institution as big as The New York Times, has a ripple effect. You’re not reaching that person that is not paying attention to you directly, but you’re creating the information reality environment that maybe one or two steps removed, the people they trust about what’s going on in the world, that’s how they organize their thinking. And part of the reason that even right as Dobbs was about to be overturned, polling wasn’t showing people were going to care about it anywhere near as much as they ended up caring about it, is that when you take a survey, and they say, well, if it’s overturned, what will you do, they can’t factor in, what will I do when my two best friends go crazy over it and are telling me all the time we’ve got to go to this rally, or that candidate is going to mean this. It’s not a direct pipeline from The New York Times to that person in the diner, but there will be someone in those people’s lives who’s influenced. And that’s the same thing for Fox. Not that many people actually watch the literal Fox, but that reality bubble goes through all the different social networks and creates a reality.

ezra klein

I do think this is a pretty important point. I’ve been thinking a lot about this with world events over the past year and a half, two years. For a while, it was very plausible and began to seem clearer and clearer that Russia was going to invade Ukraine. And one of the things that I observed in that, as somebody who was part of the world who had begun to realize this was going to happen, was even knowing that and following the news on it closely, I had trouble projecting myself correctly forward into the structure of emotion, the structure of feeling that would follow that event. I knew it would be a big deal. I knew we would have to cover it. But when it happened, it was so seismic and the experience people had watching it on social media was so intense, that just knowing that Russia was going to invade Ukraine and we were not going to it did not describe the reality that was going to happen at all. I think that if you describe to people that there would be a huge Hamas terrorist attack on Israel and then a huge Israeli air bombing and siege and then invasion of Gaza, that people would correctly have told you, I would be very upset about that. That would make me — I would not like that world event to happen. And it would have been much better if it had not happened. But the level of intense feeling for a lot of people after they see their friends weeping and Instagram stories and their Jewish friends posting about anti-Semitism, that it was not really — people are not capable of throwing themselves forward into different emotional realities that they inhabit. It’s actually something I’ve learned about programming the show. Sometimes you just have to let the emotional hit happen. And that this is just something we don’t know how to work with, and it’s a reason that I don’t buy the argument exactly that because the polls were right about the 2023 elections, that they’re also right about Biden because campaigns create a different emotional reality for people. They’re so overwhelmed with anger and emotion and intensity and outrage and coverage for a year that by the end of that, they feel differently, and feeling matters in politics.

michael podhorzer

Yes, that’s what I’m trying to say is that why —

ezra klein

I’m just agreeing with you.

michael podhorzer

OK. No, that’s why you haven’t heard me really ever criticize a particular poll, right? Because my point is that the things they say they’re trying to tell us can’t be told by it. It’s a methodological limitation, right? Just like you just described, you cannot expect human beings to understand and project forward what they’re going to think when something happens.

ezra klein

I’d ask you about another piece of this, which is I think that we are still a little bit trapped in an older version of politics, which is defined by who we like, when modern politics is defined by who we hate and who we fear. And the political science term for this is positive polarization versus negative polarization, right? Do I like Joe Biden? That’s one reason to vote for Joe Biden. Do I hate Donald Trump? That’s a reason to vote for Joe Biden, too. And I often think of Joe Biden and the Democrats in this era as working with negative polarization very effectively and positive polarization very ineffectively. Like, they’re not very good at getting people to them, but they’re good at channeling the fear and anger people have at the Republican Party. And it very much strikes me that your kind of anti-MAGA theory is basically negative polarization as a full-on campaign theory. Just take seriously that the strongest motivator for anti-Trump voters is negative. They don’t have to like Joe Biden. They have to fear Donald Trump. And that might be a much more achievable goal for not just Democrats to achieve, but Donald Trump himself to achieve because nobody’s better at making people fear Donald Trump than Donald Trump.

michael podhorzer

Absolutely, I think that’s exactly right. I think that the perspective I bring to this is not as a party partisan. It’s about preserving what will be taken away if they win. And so I see this as sort of separate from traditional electoral politics. It’s about civil society wherever you are on an ideological spectrum. So I’m not really offering advice to the Democratic Party. I’m offering advice to people who want a democratic, small D, future, that we shouldn’t have to rely on a political party to defeat this kind of movement. It’s up to us ourselves to go out and defeat it.

ezra klein

Let me ask you about another narrative you’ve been, I think it is fair to say, cranky and annoyed by, which is there’s been a move to say in recent years the dominant and rising form of polarization is educational polarization. The Democratic Party has begun doing much better among college educated voters than it used to, Republican Party much worse. Republicans are doing much better among working class voters than they used to, Democratic Party quite a bit worse. This has also led in the telling of some to a shifting dynamics around racial voting. Republicans have been doing better with Hispanic and Black voters, even in the Trump era, than people expected. Democrats have been making gains among white voters. Like that’s a big violation of the narratives, I think, as they were cohering in 2016. And you can correct me if I’m wrong, but my understanding is you believe this is actually misguided, and the thing to focus on is religious polarization. So tell me why.

michael podhorzer

The conversation we’ve had so far describes the actual dominant polarization in this country, which is between a kind of MAGA future and not that future. That is actually what’s polarizing us. And 50 years ago, you would not be talking about education polarization. You would just be talking about the actual divide happening in the world, which is really clear to see. And I do think that in a lot of ways, whether or not you have a degree in this country is devastating in terms of your economic prospects and many other things. It’s really important, but it’s not what’s making this big rip. And the reason I think you raised the religious is that within — let’s just stick with white voters for a minute. Within white voters, do you call someone who is a political evangelical a non-college voter or a religious evangelical when you’re trying to explain their voting behavior? I think, obviously, as a religious evangelical, they’re part of an actual movement. They go to church every week. They listen to Christian broadcasting. There’s no non-college broadcasting network. And if you pull that out, if you divide white voters, which I don’t think is the best way to do it, but you get a way better result than education, if you divide it into those who, on a survey, say, they’re Christian and those who don’t, the partisan voting gap is much bigger. Right? That’s what’s much more clarifying. And a white non-college voter in a blue state actually supported Biden at a higher level than a white college voter in a red state.

ezra klein

I want you to go a bit deeper on this, though, because I think you’re underselling how strident the charts I am receiving from you on this topic have been. One of the cases you’ve been making — I think this is a reasonable description — is that Trumpism is fundamentally at this point powered by religious evangelical voters, and not just Trumpism, but Mike Johnson becoming Speaker, that one way to describe what’s happening is MAGA, but when you ask how is MAGA happening, the answer is that it has developed an extraordinarily potent base among one of the few truly organized voter groups in America, which is religious evangelicals. So make that case to me that something distinctive is happening there, that you cannot understand American politics without understanding.

michael podhorzer

The case I’m trying to make is that the backlash against Obama, what got reported as the Tea Party, was anti-Republicans who were willing to accept the legitimacy of Obama as president. When McCain, like every other losing president before him and did a gracious speech immediately after, and even noted what a step forward it was that Obama was, it was kind of a breaking point within the Republican coalition, where the sort of business interests had been in the driver’s seat, the religious interests had been going along and delivering their votes for them, just flipped. They’re clustered in congressional districts. It only took about 55,000 votes to defeat rhino incumbents in those districts, so that now about 3/4 of the caucus, Republican caucus, is from the most evangelical districts in the country. That political potential was activated.

ezra klein

And so one thing you’re arguing here is that there has been an important base inside the Republican Party, right? Evangelicals have been important there for a long time. But they stopped going along, and instead, began to use their concentration in certain areas to functionally take over the party. I mean, your argument, again, particularly around Mike Johnson, is that he represents the successful takeover of this party, not because most Republican voters are from this faction, but because it actually didn’t need that many Republican House members, for instance, who just would refuse to go along with anybody who wasn’t of their faction, in order to bring the entire House to a halt in order to destroy Speaker McCarthy. So give me a bit more on that. How was this group behind McCarthy’s downfall and Johnson’s rise?

michael podhorzer

So what happens is that partly a result of geographic sorting, partly a result of gerrymandering, right? Out of the 435 districts, 390 of them are just safe, OK? And so the only competition happens in primaries, which are very low turnout and never covered by the national media. This has all been happening in plain sight. No one has paid attention to it. But what it means is that if, say, a third or 40 percent, even that little, in a congressional district are evangelical voters, and the turnout in primaries is very low, they’re almost certain to be a majority of the people voting. And if they are going even 80/20 for your primary challenger to the incumbent, that’s pretty unstoppable, right? Such a sort of hackable part of our election system if you have clustered, concentrated strength in safe districts. .[MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

So now I want to ask you about another faction that has been traditionally very important in politics now, the Democratic side, which you have very specific experience with, which is labor. So you were the longtime political director, as we’ve mentioned, of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. You retired from that fairly recently. I’d say around the same time, labor has gone through a huge resurgence in a lot of the country. I’m not saying those two events are related. [LAUGHS]

michael podhorzer

I would have left earlier.

ezra klein

Sure, but there is something happening. There is very big strikes being threatened, and one, Joe Biden is a very pro-labor president. What do you understand to be happening?

michael podhorzer

For quite a while, there was a feeling of fairly helplessness that working people felt. And part of it was the result of either the outright hostility of Republican administrations or the consequences of the kind of lukewarm support and often bigger policy problems of Democratic administrations. And the combination of COVID and the disruptions and Biden being more clearly and assertively on the side of working people, those are all pieces of a realization that maybe there’s a lot of latent power in working people that no one had been exercising. And one of the things about a resurgence is that they’re almost always historically contagious. I’m sure people have seen how 70 percent of people now support unions in this country. And 10 percent are in them. It’s not because they don’t like unions. It’s because of all the things that have been done to keep people from being in unions. And those are very real things. You’re afraid of losing your job. You’re afraid of retaliation. You’re afraid of all of these things. And so there are upsurges in union success when working people see other working people succeed.

ezra klein

So that implies you’re actually giving Biden quite a bit of credit here, that in being as pro-union as he is, you’re saying that in addition to, I think, sort of other factors, like a tight employment market and so on, that that really has been emboldening, even without Democrats passing major union law reform.

michael podhorzer

Yeah, without getting too much in the weeds, the standard operating procedure for a corporation when confronted with a potential strike had been to basically just drag their feet to count on public attention going away quickly, to count on the regulators giving them delays on unfair labor practices and things like that. And by simply agreeing to enforce the law the way it was written is a big pushback right now. It’s not enough to undo all the reasons certain sectors of the economy can’t be organized and a lot of other important things, but this really may be the first time since the ‘60s that the playing field is as level.

ezra klein

Yeah, I was going to ask this. Is it sufficient for an actual resurgence? Because on the one hand, there are very high profile fights being won, but they’re primarily being won by already unionized workforces. I mean, when you look at the UAW strike, I mean, that is an existing union. When you look at what was happening with UPS, with the screenwriters or the actors, those are existing unions. So we haven’t seen anything like the unionization of the Las Vegas hotel workers under unite here, right? There hasn’t been a big new industry, a big, new corporate chain unionized, to my knowledge. So is that kind of new unionization surge, right, something that would actually change in a positive way the percentage of Americans who belong to a union? Is that possible under the current legal regime, even with a friendly Democratic president?

michael podhorzer

I think the most straightforward answer is to return to the kind of union density that existed in the 1930s and ‘40s and ‘50s and ‘60s. The rules have to be as good. I think one of the most thrown off phrases whenever this topic comes up is the decline of the union movement or declining union membership, which is really a misdirection because, really, from the mid ‘40s right after the war, there’s been a relentless campaign by business to make sure that there aren’t more union members, and it keeps succeeding. I think there’s a way in which people say, boy, when are we going to get those good manufacturing jobs back? In the 1930s, they were as bad as the service sector jobs. What made them in our memory good was that union representation got what was needed. And so then you get to gig workers. And this is where the Democratic Party has been complicit in passing things that prevent them from organizing because they’re, quote, “independent contractors.” So but if you think about the Writers Guild strike, there’s a group of people who you would really think would see themselves as independent contractors. The idea that people who are Uber drivers want to be individuals and the writers of hit TV series don’t is nuts. But it can’t happen because we now have rules and laws that prevent them from organizing.

ezra klein

So what are the electoral effects of this rising, at least in public opinion and political salience labor movement? Does this actually affect the election, or is this a sort of separate thing happening in American life?

michael podhorzer

I think that it will definitely have an effect. People have commented on Trump doing better in 2016 with union members than Obama had. Part of it was because of union members feeling like they just hadn’t gotten enough. I mean, this is something I was actually very in the middle of. And for many of those conservative unions where that was always a risk, business has been great in the construction trades. And having been to local meetings and others, it’s a completely different dynamic in the room, right? It used to be if someone wanted to talk politics, a guy with a MAGA hat would get up and be belligerent. Much harder for that person to do that right now because work is great. So I think that’s one possible impact.

ezra klein

If you’re going to get any labor law reform, you’re going to need Joe Biden or some other Democrat re-elected or elected in 2024. I think Donald Trump is not going to do it. Joe Biden and his campaign, the Democrats have a certain amount of running room. They have strategic decisions to make. You are a relentless and pissed off critic of a lot of the people who have ideas there. You don’t like the idea that Democrats should moderate. You don’t like the idea that the thing they should do is try to poll what their most popular ideas are and just talk about that. So give me your positive perspective. You’re chief strategist on these campaigns. What are you telling Democrats to do?

michael podhorzer

One of the most important things that Democrats can do, which they did do in 2022, is do what they were elected to do, that the fact that the House Democrats were able to pull together and do such important January 6 hearings, it’s both giving people the information they need, and it’s showing that they’re actually responsible and doing their job. Right now, we see a similar kind of thing happening with the corruption stuff at the Supreme Court. It may not seem like it’s exactly what you’re asking, but it really is, because it really is the job of the Senate Democrats to make sure that voters understand what’s going on properly. And then they’ll be doing their job in a way that isn’t partisan political and absolutely necessary. And I think beyond that, I think it’s just running as responsible public officials. Basically, make no unforced errors.

ezra klein

I think that’s a good place to end. Always our final question — what are three books you would recommend to the audience?

michael podhorzer

My first recommendation is an essay that you can get online. It’s by George Orwell, and it’s called “Politics and the English Language.” I think that the way we talk about all these things makes us less able to solve all problems. And we’d just be better to have honest conversation. Second one would be kind of maybe unusual. There’s a new book called “Tyranny, Inc,” by someone who endorsed Trump before, but actually looked at the modern American labor situation and sees clearly what someone in the labor movement or someone who’s actually paying attention to what work life is like, how it’s basically a dictatorship. You have no rights. It’s just really surprising.

ezra klein

This is Sohrab Amari’s book?

michael podhorzer

Yeah.

ezra klein

Michael Podhorzer, political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., recommending a Sohrab Amari book. I’d never have expected it.

michael podhorzer

That’s exactly what I did, but because it’s built on some work by an academic, Elizabeth Anderson, who really brought attention to how we have a First Amendment in the public square and no right whatsoever in the work, all of those things, I think it’s really surprising and important that it’s coming not from someone — the A.F.L.-C.I.O. And the third is one actually that you brought to my attention, which is the book, “Crashed” by Adam Tooze, which I think should open the aperture for people about how our economy, all of these decisions are connected to the world in a way that makes everything make a lot more sense. .[MUSIC PLAYING]

809,809,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/nyregion/nyc-mental-illness-breakdowns.html,"Violent attacks by homeless, mentally ill people are relatively rare. In fact, mentally ill people are more likely to be the victim of a violent crime than to commit one. But each act of violence — every subway shoving, stabbing or slashing — can shake the city’s psyche.

The January 2022 killing of Michelle Go, a 40-year-old financial consultant who was shoved in front of an oncoming subway train, stirred public outrage and led to official promises of reform. But before all that, the man who killed her had been hospitalized at a state psychiatric facility and released despite signs that he was still delusional — the same kind of institutional breakdown that has preceded scores of other attacks, The Times found.

Times reporters spent more than a year examining how often homeless mentally ill people under the care of the city have committed acts of violence. There is no official accounting of such incidents, but The Times set out to create its own, scouring court filings, police records and news reports to identify more than 130 acts of violence carried out in recent years by people who were homeless and mentally ill.

The reporters scrutinized each case, conducting more than 250 interviews, obtaining tens of thousands of pages of confidential treatment records and visiting courthouses, jails, prisons and a psychiatric ward. The lack of public information about the incidents made it difficult to evaluate about a quarter of the cases. Still, the examination identified 94 instances in the past decade in which breakdowns of the city’s social safety net preceded the violence, sometimes by just days or hours.

The review focused on the major elements of that safety net — a disjointed patchwork of homeless shelters, hospitals and specialized teams that was stitched together after the state began closing its notorious psychiatric institutions in the 1960s. It found a widespread failure by the agencies to share information, even though the state created a detailed database expressly for that purpose. It also revealed a pattern among the agencies of taking the narrowest possible approach to care, and an unwillingness on the part of city and state officials to fully fund crucial programs, leading to understaffing and harried treatment."
810,810,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/arts/design/what-to-see-in-nyc-galleries-in-november.html,"The Jacquard loom, patented in 1804, not only revolutionized the production of textiles by automating it, but also inspired designs for early computers. It’s fitting, then, that the artist Qualeasha Wood’s Jacquard tapestries are images of complex digital displays. By translating the contents of her desktop into woven cloth, she’s closing the loop on a long cycle.

Momentum has been building around Wood’s art since it was featured in the magazine Art in America in 2021; last year, when she was just 25, the Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired one of her pieces. But this exhibition, titled “Manic Pixie Magical Negro,” is one of her first solo gallery shows. It’s every bit as good as I’d hoped.

To create her tapestries, Wood takes hundreds of selfies, which she collages, manipulates and layers in Photoshop; after her designs are woven at a mill, she hand-embellishes them with beads, often halos and stigmata. The finished products are whirling mash-ups of Catholic iconography and African American story quilts, filtered through a millennial sensibility.

My favorite piece in the show, “System Maintenance” (2023), contains a portrait of Wood staring out at the viewer. Her head is ringed by yellow beads and computer arrows, which lead our eye to a note that lists tasks for self-care. These include taking medicine and staying off social media. “Don’t look,” Wood writes — a clever play on the fact that just below, she is looking, with an unwavering gaze. Wood brings vulnerability to her works, but what comes through most strongly is her remarkable self-possession. JILLIAN STEINHAUER"

B o l i v i a IN LA PAZ, Bolivia, one afternoon at the beginning of the year, I sat in an aerie of an apartment overlooking an Andean amphitheater of bare scarified mountains. I was in the home of Eduardo Quintela Gonzáles, a 40-year-old musicologist, as he told me how his late father would take him on pilgrimages to the Basilica of Our Lady of Copacabana. They would walk for three days from their home in La Paz, the Bolivian seat of government, to the pilgrim town of Copacabana, at the edge of Lake Titicaca, 95 miles to the northwest. “Walking alone at night changes one’s perspective of things,” Quintela said. “When you set out, you think you’re going to talk to the people you’re with. But after the first day, you find you have nothing to say. It’s just you and your will to reach your destination.” 1 2 4 3 1 JAN. 29 ARRIVAL LA PAZ 3 JAN. 30 ISLAND OF THE SUN 4 JAN. 30-FEB. 3 COPACABANA 2 JAN. 30 HUATAJATA 1 FEB. 3 LA PAZ The idea of a sacred destination, reached through penance and hardship, that reconfigures one’s view of reality, is a feature of pilgrimage everywhere, but Quintela’s return to Copacabana later that week for the Feast of the Virgin on Feb. 2 was underpinned by a special sorrow: His father, the man who had made the trip to Copacabana 15 times in his life, had died the year before after a bout of Covid-19, which was followed by a diagnosis of brain cancer, an operation and then six months in a coma. “I prayed to the Virgin because he asked me to, but he died anyway,” said Quintela, who was dressed in a black hoodie and jeans, as we sat on folding chairs in a room hung with stringed instruments and masks. I was headed to Copacabana, too. Quintela and his band were due to play at Mass on the morning of fiesta. It would be his first trip back since his father had died, and he was intent on honoring him at the site of his deepest devotion. I was on a pilgrimage of sorts myself. From my home in New York, Bolivia would be my first stop in what I had envisaged as three journeys across three great faiths, spread out over a year: fiesta high in the Andes, where pre-Hispanic ritual and belief underlay Catholicism; a spring of pilgrimage through Buddhist and shamanic Mongolia; and lastly, a time of mourning in Shiite Iraq. The Island of the Sun in Bolivia’s Lake Titicaca, a pilgrimage site since before the Inca Empire. I was interested in pilgrimage as a kind of ur-travel, crucial to so much that we associate with the modern industry of tourism, from early inns, hostels and brothels to guidebooks and travel writing. In their 1978 book, “Image and Pilgrimage in Christian Culture,” the British and British American anthropologists Victor and Edith Turner imagine pilgrimage as two roads, one inbound and one outbound — one sacred, the other profane. The road in is a spiritual journey, “exteriorized mysticism,” to use the Turners’ phrase. The road out is less about faith and more about travel itself — that radical business of leaving the safety of one’s home to journey, as Chaucer writes in “The Canterbury Tales” (1400), “to ferne halwes, couthe in sondry londes” (“to far-off shrines, known in sundry lands”). The word “pilgrim” itself derives from the Latin peregrinus, meaning “one from abroad” — a foreigner. In India, where I grew up, and where the sacred topography of pilgrimage stitches the land together, the Hindi word for traveler, yatri, is still the same as the word for pilgrim. I remember afternoon naps with my grandmother in Delhi on days of savage heat, when she would exhort me to take her to the various holy sites, now the shrine of Vaishno Devi in the Himalayas, now the temple town of Varanasi, curled languidly about the Ganges. As in medieval Europe, pilgrimage, not tourism, was the primary motivation to travel at all for someone like my grandmother; years later, I was amazed to find that it was the same for my husband’s grandmother, an evangelical Christian living in the American South. The first time Lyra Skinner, at 85, got on a plane and left the Deep South was to go to the Holy Land. Pilgrimage made familiar the unfamiliar, allowing those who might not be persuaded to go to the nearest big city to venture thousands of miles away. Standing in the garden of Gethsemane, Lyra was struck most by how at home she felt. On the Island of the Sun in Lake Titicaca, where a pre-Inca deity is said to have first ordered the heavenly bodies to ascend to the sky. In my 20s, I set out on my own pilgrimage, to Mecca, among other places, in search of the country and faith of my Pakistani father, who was a stranger to me for most of my life. At the time, I had felt my own lack of religious belief as a severe limitation. I was too young then to see that faith, though a crucial ingredient in pilgrimage, was not all. “A cocktail of motives” — to borrow a term from the British writer Victoria Preston’s 2020 book, “We Are Pilgrims” — sets us on the road to pilgrimage. In medieval times, one might be sent on a pilgrimage by a magistrate as a sentence for a crime. The Prophet Muhammad, having conquered all of Arabia in 630, clearing Mecca of its pagan idols in the process, went back two years later on a triumphant pilgrimage. The Crusaders saw themselves above all as pilgrims. Long before Quintela, the grief pilgrim had walked Jerusalem’s Via Dolorosa, merging private anguish with the suffering of Christ. The Basilica of Our Lady of Copacabana in Bolivia is home to a 16th-century sculpture of the Virgin Mary that draws thousands of pilgrims every February. I was interested in this other human side of pilgrimage — the road out, as it were. I imagined it to be full of danger and fun, populated with bawdy characters such as Chaucer’s Wife of Bath. I had chosen three faiths that were at odd angles to my own background — my father was Muslim, but not Shiite; my paternal grandmother was Christian, but not Catholic; my mother was Sikh, which made her part of the Indic fold, but not Buddhist. A few months before I began my three pilgrimages, I found myself stricken with a loss of my own. Zinc, our beloved shepherd-lab mix, became gravely ill and died soon after. For so many of us, pets become our whole lives. “Grief has its own exigencies,” writes V.S. Naipaul in an essay about the death of his father, his younger brother and his cat, Augustus. “We can never tell beforehand for whom we will feel grief.” My husband, Ryan, and I had both known the oblique grief of trying to mourn fathers from whom we were estranged — both of whom were killed at gunpoint — but the sorrow we felt over Zinc was as direct a thing as we had ever known. On that first morning in La Paz, sitting in that garret of an apartment in Vino Tinto, a working-class neighborhood of winding treeless streets, listening to Quintela speak of his year of loss, I felt myself overcome with emotion — whether from the rawness of Zinc’s death, the altitude or the ghost of my unmourned father. A painting of the Virgin of Copacabana and her namesake basilica hanging in a courtyard behind the church. I WAS TO LEAVE the city the next day at dawn with my guide, Monica Machicao. The plan was to drive deeper into the Altiplano, which is a world unto itself, a vast expanse of tableland spread across Bolivia, Chile and Peru. We were headed to the edge of Lake Titicaca, about two hours away. The entire basin of the holy lake had been a site of pilgrimage long before the Spanish conquest, indeed long before the Incas themselves. On the way to Copacabana for fiesta, I wanted to make a brief stop at the romantically named Islands of the Moon and the Sun. They sit across the bay from the sanctuary of the Virgin of Copacabana and played a central role in the creation stories of this enclosed alpine culture. At over 12,000 feet, the air was as thin as glass. Nicholas Casey, the former Andes bureau chief for The New York Times, had warned me about the effects of the elevation. He advised that I start taking medicine to ward off altitude sickness while I was still in New York but, despite the pills, I couldn’t believe what the air in the Altiplano did to my body: the searing shortness of breath, the piston beating of my heart, the throbbing headache. “We have millions more red blood cells than other people,” Monica said, “plus our lungs are bigger.” It was Casey who had introduced me to Monica, a veteran journalist in her 50s. In learning of her antipathy for the nativist politics of the former Bolivian president Evo Morales — the country’s first Indigenous president, the man under whom the nation had been refounded in 2009 as the Plurinational State of Bolivia — I was given a foretaste of the inner tensions of the society I found myself in. I grew up in postcolonial India, sloughing off two (or 10, depending on whom you ask) centuries of foreign rule, both British and Muslim. In one sense, the history of Bolivia resembles that of India. Both countries were subjugated by a European colonial power: Britain started conquering India two centuries after Spain’s conquest of the Americas. Bolivia attained its independence from Spain in 1825, 122 years before India pushed out the British. In both countries, the preconquest society is in many ways intact. In Bolivia, whole nations of pre-Columbian peoples, such as the Aymara and the Quechua, have lived on, under varying layers of Hispanization, which has seeped through into every aspect of identity, from religion and culture to language and race. If India was like Bolivia in one respect, it was like medieval Spain in another: Both countries had known centuries of Muslim rule until, in 1492 — the year that Columbus sailed to the Americas — a resurgent Catholic Spain expelled its last Muslim emir, completing what came to be called La Reconquista. It was that New World power that, under men like Hernán Cortés and Francisco Pizarro, would go on to conquer Aztec Mexico in 1521 and Inca Peru and Bolivia in the 1530s. Copacabana and the basilica at center as seen from Calvary Hill. On that first day with Monica, listening to her speak of feeling like a racial outsider in a country where her ancestors had been for five centuries, I began to understand how fresh the wounds of this history still were. “What do they see when they see you?” I asked. “A white woman,” she said. “And it’s not true! My father’s mother had Indigenous origins.” Leaving La Paz past shanties, glitzy cholets (party halls) and shops full of televisions and washing machines, I soon set eyes on the Cordillera Real (the Royal Mountain Range) for the first time. The city was behind us and we were in a vast grassland speckled with tiny habitations when, hovering to our right, there appeared the black and jagged shapes of high Andean peaks, their hollows filled with waxy disks of sunlit snow. Monica had spoken earlier of the holiness of mountains in Andean culture. One famous image of La Virgen del Cerro, the Virgin of the Hill, depicts her whole figure, save her hands, consumed by the mountain. “They are the true Hindus,” a friend of mine with a long experience of South America messaged me, referring to the hybridity he had witnessed in the Altiplano. “They absorb everything and remain themselves.” Gazing at these holy eminences, their bases shrouded in mist, the summits piercing a band of clear blue sky above, I was intimately aware that this was part of the staggering spectacle of nature that had first inspired worship among the people of the Altiplano. Then, shortly after, the lake itself appeared. On that day of many moods, Lake Titicaca’s pellucid waters were shades of silver, slate, blue and charcoal and edged with reeds. It is an inland sea the size of Puerto Rico and, at 12,500 feet, the highest navigable lake in the world. A red-bottomed hydrofoil awaited at the small town of Huatajata, ready to take us deeper into what our guide on the boat described as the “sacred lake for our Andean civilization, the Andean Mecca.” During the fiesta to celebrate the Virgin of Copacabana, Aymara women decorate the road that leads from the basilica to the shore of Lake Titicaca with flower petals. On that bright January morning, the hydrofoil slipped through a narrow strait and the full immensity of the 3,200-square-mile lake — nearly half of which is in Bolivia, the rest in Peru — came into view. An hour or so later, the Islands of the Sun and the Moon appeared. They had low crested hills, with Inca terraces, that rose out of the leaden water. On their summits I saw wheeling flights of mountain caracaras, coral-faced birds of prey. It was here that the pre-Inca deity Viracocha was said to have ordered the heavenly bodies to rise for the first time. On the Island of the Sun, I had wanted to hike the five or six miles to see the rock from which it’s said that the sun had first risen, since this older site of pilgrimage was an antecedent of the Christianized fiesta, but, within hours of arriving, we were informed that it was unsafe to go to the sacred crag on foot. A conflict had broken out between two local communities, and the only way to reach the northern tip of the island was by boat. Our informant was Pablo Quisbert, an Indigenous researcher who had come over from Copacabana to join us for the day. A replica of the Virgin on parade. The lunch group Monica had assembled had all the makings of a three-men-walk-into-a-bar joke. In addition to Quisbert, there was the Rev. Leandro Chitarroni, an Argentine priest whose numerous Bolivian parishioners influenced his decision to return to Copacabana for the Feast of the Virgin. There was also Andrés Eichmann Oehrli, a professor of Latin American literature at the Universidad Mayor de San Andrés in La Paz. Over peanut soup and steak with fries, I asked Father Chitarroni about the Roman Catholic Church’s appropriation of Andean sanctity. “The problem we have all over the Americas,” he said, “is when you give people the Good News and it is contrary to their local beliefs. We can introduce new things,” he added, “but we have to let people keep their roots — the thoughts of their parents.” I was intrigued by Father Chitarroni’s open embrace of syncretism. The Spain that conquered the New World, full of the religious zeal of La Reconquista (and the Inquisition), had been uniquely incapable of understanding how among the earth religions, like that of the Incas, it was possible to adopt new deities without forgoing the old gods. In “Conquistadores” (2021), the Mexican historian Fernando Cervantes writes that the arrival of every new bishop in the New World instigated a campaign aimed at the “extirpation” of “idolatry” in the Americas. THAT AFTERNOON, WE all took a boat with a smoky outboard motor to the tip of the island. At sunset, we walked a short distance uphill to the sacred rock, which the conquistadors had stripped of its gold and silver sheeting. In his 1653 book, “Inca Religion and Customs,” the Jesuit priest Bernabé Cobo writes that the reddish-green rock that we were now in front of, its vertical face some 18 feet high, had been a gathering place for large groups of pilgrims who had come from far away. “Thus this place became so famous that its memory will live on among the Indians as long as they last,” he writes. No pilgrim now came to the spot where the sun had first risen, even though we all felt its strange Ozymandian power. What looked like a sacrificial table of white sandstone, surrounded by andesite blocks, prompted Quisbert to speak of capacocha, an Inca ritual in which children of both sexes were selected for sacrifice. The table was the object of tourist lore, scarcely a few decades old. Just as Catholicism had appropriated Andean sanctity, so now did tourism titillate visitors in a place where pilgrims had come with holy dread in their hearts. Across the bay, a ghostly white basilica was preparing for its biannual fiesta, which would take place over two days and include several nights of revelry. Copacabana had been home to a pre-Christian shrine featuring what a Spanish chronicler had called a blue-stone idol, which was possibly female and fish-bodied. It had been part of this ancient nexus of pilgrimage that had included the Islands of the Sun and the Moon but, in the 16th century with the arrival of the Spanish, its old sanctity had been reconsecrated in the figure of the Virgin. Standing between these two poles of pilgrimage, one defunct, one active, I couldn’t help but wonder who the ultimate victors are in a land where conquest has brought about a rupture with the past, yet where the old culture has so thoroughly assimilated the new as to leave it unrecognizable. Edgar Quispe and his wife, Tatiana Huayhua, two of the prestes, or fiesta officials who help organize and sponsor the two-day biannual event. This idea is embodied in the statue of the Virgin of Copacabana that the Indigenous artist Francisco Tito Yupanqui sculpted in the mid-1570s. The Spanish had been on the Altiplano for less than 50 years when the native sculptor, born in Copacabana, began depicting Mary in ways that subverted unspoken aesthetic norms of her as white and European. On seeing Yupanqui’s early efforts, the Spanish bishop was brutal in his contempt, telling the artist that his depictions of Mary looked like a bearded man and that he was better suited to paint la mona con su mico (“a monkey with her baby”). But Yupanqui persevered, said Father Chitarroni: “His religious search had to fulfill a European aesthetic, but the image he did is mestizo.” Arriving in Copacabana the next morning by boat, I wandered through streets of red cinder block and brightly colored corrugated metal, all coalescing around the hulking mass of the basilica, which, with its tiled domes of greenish brown, dwarfed the pilgrim town of about 10,000. Inside, at the center of a baroque altarpiece, was Yupanqui’s Virgin, bathed in white fluorescent light. Rarely had I seen so arrestingly beautiful a rendering of Mary, dark and solemn-eyed. “The singularity of this Virgin,” said Quisbert as we peered at her through the gloom of the basilica, “is not merely that an Indigenous artist created her — she’s also an Indigenous Virgin. Not white, not Black, but morena.” A beautiful word, to which the English “brown” does little justice. Wandering the bowels of that vast church preparing for fiesta, we encountered the head priest, Friar Abelino Yeguaori, in his cocoa-colored Franciscan habit. He stood in a room that contained the Virgin’s many dazzling outfits — with pinks, lilacs, blues and reds and embroidered gold. They had been donated by devotees and included one in a plain forest green, with an insignia of two crossed rifles under a condor, for she is the patron saint of the police, too. Friar Yeguaori was to lead the procession the next day but was full of worries. The weather was changeable, now rain, clouds and mist; now bursts of bright mountain sunshine. The border with Peru, a major source of pilgrims, had been closed because of postelection turmoil there. He feared there would be scarcely one or two thousand pilgrims, instead of the usual 30,000 to 40,000, which would be bad not just for morale but because fewer pilgrims meant a sizable loss in donations. Nor did it help that evangelism was on the rise all over South America. “They tell them they cannot adore images,” Friar Yeguaori said, his brows beetling. “First they tell them God will punish them, then they take their money, saying, ‘If you give us money, God will give you more.’ ” BY MORNING, A sharp alpine sun had banished Friar Yeguaori’s fears of a poorly attended feast. Black smoke from firecrackers drifted across the blue sky, and the calm of the square outside the church was broken by the mournful martial thud of drums and the asthmatic hiss of trombones. A full brass band, in gray suits and sunglasses — the Real Andinos (or Royal Andeans) — was preparing to welcome the first pilgrims to the Feast of the Virgin of Copacabana. A stream of beribboned SUVs stood outside the church awaiting blessings. In front of them were offerings of sparkling wine and, on paper plates, petals, red-capped bottles containing a dark viscous brew of alcohol and coca leaves and clear plastic pouches of rice, sugar and cinnamon. “My father used to bring me here,” said Irene, a 65-year-old fruit and vegetable seller in a blue polka-dot dress. She had come from La Paz with her daughter, Juana, and their white terrier, Blanquita. “In those days we came in trucks. There were no buses, and the road was just sand. He would tell me to get down on my knees and ask the Virgin for favor, and we would encircle the church just like that.” Irene’s face shone with piety but, like the hajji, whose pilgrimage to Mecca gives him immeasurable esteem in his community, there was also an element of self-satisfaction. Pilgrimage cloaked itself in godliness and sacrifice, but its motivations were not always altruistic. In Varanasi, at a house of death where old people came to breathe their last — for to die in the holy city was to be free of the cycle of life and death — I had witnessed firsthand the sacrifices of children who left busy modern lives to fulfill the spiritual ambitions of their parents. Naipaul, in “India: A Wounded Civilization” (1977), describes the Hindu quietism of a fictional character in a well-known Indian novel as “parasitic: It depends on the continuing activity of others, the trains running, the presses printing, the rupees arriving from somewhere. It needs the world, but it surrenders the organization of the world to others.” I wondered now if pilgrimage did not have something of that same quality, self-indulgence sublimated into piety. Two kids came cartwheeling up to us in costume. There was an 8-year-old boy with a green-and-yellow mask and red coat dressed as a kusillo, a little devil, or trickster. His 11-year-old sister was a milkmaid. They were performing a rustic dance called the Waka Waka. Their mother, Aracely Alcón, in white tights and pale orange eye shadow, was there, too. When Santiago, the boy, was 4, Alcón told us, he fell from the second floor of a building and hit his head. “We thought he was dead,” she said. He was paralyzed and could only move his head. “Our family are true believers of the Virgin, and I prayed, ‘It’s my son, don’t take him away.’ The Virgin is a mother, too. She understood my pain.” A week later, the paralysis broke and, after a year of rehab, Santiago was back on his feet. “He’s a walking miracle,” Alcón said. “We come here dancing to thank the Virgin.” Copacabana’s Fraternidad Morenada Transportes Manco Kapac performing at the fiesta. Father Chitarroni was dancing, too. He came up to us in a rented brown poncho carrying a staff. He was to play the key role of the jilakata (village leader) in the dance that was to ensue. “For these people, dance is like an offering, a prayer,” he said. All around us festivity was erupting. It was noon and there were dozens of people in the forecourt of the church, with dozens more pouring in from the main square and surrounding streets beyond. A line of milkmaids in hoop skirts of bright green and orange came trundling into the church. The clamor of numerous brass bands filled the air. Old Aymara women in multilayered polleras (frilled skirts), in maroons and oranges, with aprons and bowler hats, appeared on the sloping street that led from the church to the sacred lake. Armed with bags full of petals, trumpet flowers and leaves, they moved swiftly down the axial street ornamenting it, there with the Inca sun, here with the sign of the cross. Dancers preparing for the Waka Waka, a traditional pastoral dance. The westering sun burned away every trace of a morning drizzle. I was heading down the main street looking for Monica, when suddenly, resplendent in the daylight and framed against the mountains, there appeared a replica of Yupanqui’s Virgin, dressed in white and gold. She was on a palanquin carried on the shoulders of six men. Behind her came an impressive formation of church and municipal leaders with satin sashes across their breasts. Friar Yeguaori was there, too, again in his Franciscan habit. Behind them were women in brown vicuña mantas and bowlers. The townspeople threw flowers at the procession as it went by, up to the gate of the sanctuary, where the Virgin was enthroned at the entrance. The local leaders sat on a podium facing her. “Today we celebrate the arrival of the Virgin of Copacabana, who came here in 1583 from Potosí and was made by the hands of Tito Yupanqui,” began Copacabana’s council president, who wore a blue-and-white sash. The area outside of the church had become a great stage. Troupe after stupendous troupe, consisting of musicians and dancers from all over Bolivia and as far afield as Argentina, made their way up the street performing for the Virgin. Among the most striking dances was the Morenada, which some believe emerged from the plight of Black slaves in the silver mines of Potosí. The dancers wore white metal masks, green-and-white feathers and hoop skirts with tassels. After sharing capfuls of Scotch, they began their dark dithyrambic dance, rattling the matraca, an instrument that Monica said imitates the clanking and heavy tread of slave chains. It felt like a protest dance, percussive and hypnotic, unashamed in its embrace of the signifiers of enslavement. The most beautiful of the acts was Uma Marka, a troupe whose name means “land of water.” At the center was a man who played an Andean trumpet of war called a pututu. “I came from afar to fulfill my promise / because I love you with my soul,” the man sang. “I will always cherish you, my beautiful little morenita. / I will always adore you, Copacabeñita.” Then, almost in the same breath, he began to sing in praise of Pachamama (Mother Earth), “shin[ing] in the cosmos.” He was a schoolteacher from Warisata, one of the lake towns. When I asked him how it was so easy for him to sing to both the Virgin and Pachamama, he said, “Both of them are the same for us. The Virgin is the mother of God. Pachamama is the mother of the earth.” As the formal acts began to wrap up around 7 p.m., the spirit of fiesta started to spread through the confetti-strewn streets of the town. The members of Uma Marka passed around handles of Scotch. Half-consumed cans of beer lay at their feet. I was chewing a mouthful of coca leaves from a green plastic bag and they gave the afternoon a wonderful, thrilling edge. There is always an underlying darkness to carnival, the creeping strangeness of masks and extreme drunkenness. As night fell, this mood, tinged with hints of dislocation and panic, took hold. Young men with haggard faces and gaping mouths roamed the streets. A featureless pounding music, emanating from an indoor arena, drifted up to my hotel room until well after 3 a.m. I had spoken that evening to Amaru Fiorilo Barrios, the 29-year-old half-Dutch, half-Bolivian son of the owners of the Hotel La Cúpula, where we were staying. Dressed in a pink hoodie and turquoise cap, his long hair windblown, he told me of the powerful epiphany he’d had during the pandemic related to pilgrimage. Even as the tourist industry vanished from the face of the earth, “we were full all the weekends with pilgrims,” Fiorilo said. The border with Peru had been closed, as it was now, but they came by foot. The Altiplano, said Fiorilo, goes beyond borders. It was an important point: Pilgrimages are located within national boundaries even as they transcend them. The shrine of Santiago de Compostela is in Spain, but the pilgrimage does not belong to Spain any more than the pilgrimage to Mecca belongs to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, or the sacred landscape of the Buddha’s life to the modern states of India and Nepal. Nations, of course, try to draw validity from being home to major pilgrimage sites, but the 19th-century nation-state, a jealous and petty master, can never quite attain to the subtle complex of belief and belonging that pilgrimage engenders. Fiorilo, who’d grown up in a westernized atmosphere in La Paz, was conscious of the need to honor the old religion of the Altiplano. “It’s very important to keep it” — that is, to adhere to it, he said — “because it’s the identity of the people.” Pilgrimage is bigger than the nation and, though it derives its authority from religion, it’s often bigger than religion, too. Like the journey to Mecca, which started as a pre-Islamic pilgrimage common to many tribes of the Arabian Peninsula, this fiesta is at bottom an emanation of Andean culture. The religious component acts almost as a framing device for the expression of distinctive cultural elements, rituals, customs, song and dance, such as the Waka Waka, or the ancient pre-Christian use of llama parts in sacrifice. Valeria Alcón (right) and her brother, Santiago, dressed as a milkmaid and a kusillo, or little devil, for the fiesta; a village leader carrying a pututu, an instrument of war and assembly; Laureano Jose Quisbert, from one of the local fraternities; and Elena Ticona Flores, also from a local fraternity. ON THE WAY to Mass the next morning, we passed young men still in their suits eating fricase, a pork stew of potatoes and hominy, from plastic containers. “Hangover food,” Monica said. The church was full when we arrived. The air smelled of lilies. Worshipers streamed in and out with replicas of the Virgin in plastic cases stuffed with fake U.S. dollars. In an altar to one side, Eduardo Quintela’s band, Ensamble Sincrético (Syncretic Ensemble), was warming up. It gave me a pang to see him, still in his black hoodie, surrounded by a padre-violinist in a Franciscan habit and female vocalists with shawls about their shoulders. Watching Quintela, his face drawn inward in concentration, I felt all the power of his tribute to his father, who had first brought him on pilgrimage to Copacabana. One of the several open-air stages erected for the fiesta around the main square in Copacabana, where the festivities carry on late into the night. This was the road into the shrine, the spiritual journey, in which pilgrims came before the Virgin bearing grief, joy and gratitude in their hearts. Her cult was fed by this stream of humanity, each confiding in her, and she, in turn, edified the private circumstances of each individual life through her munificence, making the one feel part of a whole. For her, of seemingly limitless patience, no human drama was too insignificant, too tawdry, too wretched or alien. Her maternal consolations rested on her acceptance, her love, her understanding. “What is secret in the Christian pilgrimage, then, is the inward movement of the heart,” write the Turners. As Mass got going, Ensamble Sincrético filled the gold-and-blue vault of the church with haunting music. “A Vuestros Pies Madre” (“At Your Feet, Mother”), they played. It evoked the spirit of an older Europe, even as it sounded unmistakably Indigenous — so much so that the Europeans who came after the original missionaries didn’t recognize it as their own until they were shown the sheets on which it had been carefully scored. It was Christian missionaries — that endless flow of Jesuit, Augustinian, Dominican and Franciscan friars — who primarily brought baroque music to Bolivia. It formed a deep synthesis here with a culture for which music was already a form of worship. As Quintela explained to me, referring to the Guarayos, an Indigenous group in northeastern Bolivia: “When they die, they must pass several tests [in order to reach the afterlife. One of them] is to cross a river on the back of an alligator who only advances to music. If he [the deceased] is not a good musician, the alligator devours the soul of the Guarayo.” Altar boys, swinging silver thuribles, came down the nave of the church, incense smoke wafting up behind them. Then came members of the clergy, some of whom, including Father Chitarroni and Friar Yeguaori, I now knew, but who had been utterly transformed by pomp and circumstance. The Bishop of El Alto led the Mass, and dignitaries, such as Senator Rodrigo Paz Pereira, whose father had been a president of Bolivia, were part of the congregation. Lake Titicaca, which has been considered a sacred site for centuries, is, at 12,500 feet, the world’s highest navigable lake. As Mass ended, we filed out behind the Virgin. The senator, dressed down in a brown jacket and jeans, said that Yupanqui’s Virgin had a special importance against the background of postcolonial history. “She’s a unifying figure, as well as their protectress,” he said. “Through her, they can talk, they can communicate.” Outside, the streets were thronged with brass bands. One of the prestes — a key official in the organization of the pilgrimage — was bedecked in garlands of spring flowers like a fertility god. In the main square, Friar Yeguaori was leading the Virgin in a procession, stopping at every corner to ask for a special blessing — for the children, the town, the leadership, the country. I had wanted to find more examples of how the old pre-Columbian religion of the Altiplano merged with Catholicism. That afternoon I got my chance. Climbing Calvary Hill, where stations of the cross were installed in the 1950s, I could see the bay and town, rain washed red against dark hills. At its summit, amid tombs and sleeping dogs, women sold models illustrating another key ingredient of pilgrimage: want, hard material want. There were plastic replicas of every conceivable kind of habitation, from empty plots of land to little green-roofed houses and condos; toy models of every brand and style of car, from SUVs to racy two-doors, and crude piles of fake American dollars and euros. Monica, with a son in college and a daughter who is about to start her master’s degree program, bought two folders of academic degrees to be blessed by the Virgin. It was oddly moving to have this concrete insight into people’s lives through the things they wanted most. Descending Calvary, we came across a young couple standing in front of a statuette of the Virgin and a bright red model car. The woman was weeping, wiping away strands of long black hair from her face. An older man was performing a ritual of sorts with a little brass bell, burning coals and incense. Another, in a red bolero, stood at his side. Everyone seemed very drunk. Cups of beer were being passed around, some sipped, some deliberately spilled in honor of Pachamama. When the ritual was done, we approached. They were Argentines of Bolivian origin who lived in Buenos Aires. They had come by car, driving for three days, bringing with them their own statuette of the Virgin. It seemed like a long way to come, but “if you love the Virgin, it doesn’t matter how long the road is,” they said. When I asked them about the rite, which would hardly have been out of place on the banks of the Ganges in Varanasi, the younger man, Axel, explained that it was a blessing. The man performing it was an amauta, a shamanic figure. The young couple desperately wanted a car of their own. “Whatever we desire, the Virgin will give us the power and the will,” said Axel. Pilgrimage, though couched in spiritual aims, often bordered on sheer cupidity. Some wanted peace, love and health, others an automobile, but everyone wanted something. When I asked Axel why his wife had been crying earlier, he said, “We need to have faith, and there’s a lot of emotion [involved].” But was there no conflict between these two systems of belief, the Virgin and the amauta? “It’s just a belief,” the man in the red bolero said, casually expressing a great truth about the unthinking quality of its hold over us. “We believe in the priest, and we believe in the amauta.” The wizened-faced amauta sang. He rang his bell. He used incense, a holdover from the classical world everywhere, to entreat the Virgin to give the couple what they wanted. When he was finished, I asked him what his religion was. “Católico,” the amauta said. But what about this rite? That was surely not Catholic. “It’s from our ancestors,” he said. “This was from before we were Catholic.” The fiesta ended as all good parties should: in shame, debauchery, ignominy and tears. All around the main square, open-air stages had been erected. Boy bands in sequined jackets were dancing and playing. Men with their arms draped about one another’s shoulders reeled through the streets. In a gold-pillared room with neon orange beams, one couple — she in red lace, he in a burgundy suit — had fallen asleep in each other’s arms. A visibly drunk young man in a gray suit with a red tie strode up to me. He had seen me that morning at Mass taking notes. Turning to a toy representation of the Virgin, he said, “This is our culture, these are our values, this is our tradition. Everything we have, we owe to her.” Then he implored me to drink and spill. “You have to ask,” he said, looking at the doll with fresh urgency. “Whatever you want, she will give to you.” I was not above asking. I had come out of a year of illness and malaise, in which my grief over Zinc had gotten tied up with my fears about a new novel. My longtime publisher had sat on it for months before passing. I was midcareer. I was afraid of being put out of business. In writing, as in life, we fetishize the beginning, all that youth and ambition. We love the idea of peace or resignation at the end, in our twilight years, but we speak so little of the middle, where most of our lives are spent. For many of us, nothing so grand as even a midlife crisis materializes. There is just the great slog of carrying on without losing one’s nerve. I had not arrived as a pilgrim to Copacabana but, in being someone who also had something to ask of life, I became one. I asked that my novel find a publisher. “If it comes true,” my new friend said with a grin, “you’ll have to come back, you know?” La Paz, the country’s seat of government, to which the writer Aatish Taseer traveled for the first of his three pilgrimages.

M o n g o l i a I GREW UP in India with all the major world religions. I attended a Christian boarding school in a Hindu-majority country that is roughly tied with Pakistan for the second-largest Muslim population in the world. My mother’s family were Sikhs, and I counted among my closest friends a Jew from Bombay and Buddhists from Tibet. Pilgrimage is common to all of these faiths, even as it is utterly distinctive. In Islam, the pilgrimage to Mecca is an ordained pillar of faith that the Prophet Muhammad performed himself. In Christianity, the culture of cherishing relics and visiting holy places is said to have begun with Saint Helena — the mother of Constantine I, the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity in 312 — rushing off to the Holy Land in search of the True Cross. Some pilgrimages enshrine sorrow, like the Ashura in Iraq, which would be the last stop on my journey; others, like fiesta in Bolivia’s Copacabana, are pilgrimages of joy and rapture. Some are historical, like the Jewish commemoration of exile; others, like the Mecca pilgrimage, represent the repurposing of an older sanctity, in this case that of pre-Islamic Arabia. Some pilgrimages focus on a single day, others a season, a month, an auspicious alignment of the stars. In India, which has some of the greatest scenes of pilgrimage anywhere in the world, such as the Kumbh Mela, where every 12 years the largest gathering of humanity on earth — more than 100 million — comes together at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, I had also witnessed the touching intimacy of a family or group of friends who set out for a holy place on a Sunday, just as someone might go fishing or to a national park in the United States. 1 5 2 4 3 1 MAY 20 ARRIVAL ULAANBAATAR 1 MAY 25-28 ULAANBAATAR 1 MAY 22 ULAANBAATAR 3 MAY 23 KHARKHORIN 4 MAY 24 ERDENET 5 MAY 25 AMARBAYASGALANT 2 MAY 20 KHAMAR KHIID It was the ordinariness of this latter kind of pilgrimage, away from the grand spectacles of Ashura and fiesta, that I had hoped to capture in Buddhist Mongolia. I had imagined springtime pilgrimages, people visiting monasteries as the weather warmed. If La Paz is the highest capital in the world, Ulaanbaatar is the coldest, with January temperatures reaching minus 30 degrees. In fact, even as I was setting out at the end of May, my guide and translator, Orgilbaatar Tsolmon, who goes by Orgil, was sending me videos of snow showers in the Mongolian capital. My flight from New York connected through Istanbul; the first leg was 10 hours, and from there we flew another eight hours in a level line across the face of Asia. The Black Sea gave way to the Caspian and, beyond, to a land of mountain, desert and steppe. The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan and his descendants, poured over the steppe in the 13th century and, in the words of the 18th-century British historian Edward Gibbon, “the caliphs fell, and the Caesars trembled on their throne,” even as representatives of the major faiths — from Islam and Nestorian Christianity to Taoism and myriad forms of Buddhism — would come before the great khans to make their case for why their particular creed ought to be the official religion of the empire. My first glimpse of Mongolia was of rolling hills draped in thin emerald grass, of cloud shadows the size of lakes and of raking beams of morning light breaking through a heavy sky. “Nomadism,” I scribbled in my notebook in a sleepless haze, “captures the very spiritual heart of pilgrimage, which is to wander.” If the Latin peregrinus gives us “pilgrim,” it also gives us “peregrination.” Orgil was waiting for me at Chinggis Khaan International Airport in Ulaanbaatar with a red Nissan SUV. My first thought on seeing him, with his long hair and light beard, was of the Nepalese artist Araniko’s late 13th-century rendering of Kublai Khan, Genghis Khan’s grandson. “In Xanadu, did Kubla Khan / A stately pleasure-dome decree. ...” The Coleridge poem was the first I had committed to memory as a child, during a blackout in Delhi, but Kublai was more than the figment of an opium dream. He was a full historical personage who founded the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368) in China and established Beijing (then known as Dadu) as its capital, and was the man whose conversion to Buddhism around 1258 brought shamanic Mongolia into the orbit of Tibetan Buddhism. A tourist camp about 50 miles east of Erdene Zuu monastery. The influence of Buddhism grew sporadically for almost seven centuries in Mongolia, merging in profound ways with its ancient worship of nature — of mountains, water, the eternal blue sky. But then, in the early decades of the 20th century, Buddhism encountered a mortal enemy: Soviet-backed Communism. Even by the standards of a tumultuous century, the Stalin-directed purges of the late 1930s stood out for their systematic eradication of Mongolia’s religious culture. The great majority of the country’s monastic institutions were leveled to the ground; some 18,000 monks were killed; and, in a society where about one-third of the adult male population were lamas (though not all living in monasteries), Buddhism was ripped out root and branch. In 1990, with the fall of Communism, religious freedom was established in Mongolia and Buddhism was allowed to be practiced again. My first destination was the Khamar monastery, 300 miles south in the Gobi Desert, which had been all but destroyed in 1938. It was said to be situated at one of the portals to Shambhala — a mythical kingdom of peace and tranquillity in the Buddhist imagining — and had been founded in the century before by an artist, saint and sybarite called Danzanravjaa, known as the lama of the Gobi. Bolivia had given me new respect for the survival of the sacred, despite great political and historical upheavals, and I was curious to see what pilgrimage would look like in a place where it had been stamped out for generations — curious to see the old pilgrim routes leading back to the locus of sanctity, like neural pathways reforming around an area of trauma. A fertility shrine in Mongolia’s Gobi Desert a short drive from the Khamar monastery. Founded in the early 19th century by an artist and saint known as the lama of the Gobi, Khamar was left in ruins after the Stalin-directed purges of the 1930s. MONGOLIA, BROADLY SPEAKING, is a country with half the landmass of India and a population smaller than that of Los Angeles proper — some 3.3 million people — of which about half live in Ulaanbaatar alone. As we left the capital’s new Japanese-built airport armed with supplies of chips, Snickers, Coke Zeros and vodka as offerings, I gained a first impression of an unnerving emptiness. After some initial settlements of white yurts, or gers, as they’re known here, and houses with brightly colored corrugated roofs behind dark wooden stockades, all signs of habitation fell away. On that morning in late May, spectral wisps of snow blew over the long two-lane highway, and the wind was so strong that I found it difficult to put my jacket on outside the car. A site with caves near the Khamar monastery, where monks would meditate for a period of 108 days, the span reflecting a symbolic number in Buddhism. Amid what seemed like trackless wastes there periodically appeared the giant ragged form of an ovoo, or cairn. Its beanpole of a body was bandaged in blue khadags (prayer scarves), its stony mound of a base littered with vodka bottles and the occasional skull of a dead animal. The ovoo is a monument to the spirits of the natural world, known here as nagas and savdags. Orgil, following the custom of honoring these easily offended beings, lest they punish you for your neglect, honked three times as we went by. “This is the Gen Z way,” he said, grinning, “but I prefer the old way,” which involves circling the ovoo on foot three times in a clockwise motion. But it was too cold to stop. It was too cold to smoke, too cold to take a pee. The temperature was only in the low 30s, but the wind bit through me, and it was hard to believe that this was a relatively mild spring day by Mongolian standards. Outside Choir, a dust-bitten town halfway to the monastery, we inhaled a lunch of mutton broth and dumplings, fried rice and a meat-stuffed pastry called a khuushuur. Then we drove on, another four hours. The land turned arid and flat. Double-humped Bactrian camels appeared along the side of the road. An enticing band of opalescent sky offered the relief of a horizon after hours of rain and snow. Orgil, in between telling me of his days in a metal band, when “I drank beers left and right,” would occasionally grow serious. “During Communism,” he said, “we lost our national identity.” The purges of the 1930s plundered the country’s monasteries and temples — there had been some 700 in the 19th century — which Orgil described as repositories of folklore, history, traditional medicine and learning. Mongolia, after winning independence from Qing China in 1911, began those early decades of the 20th century as a feudal theocracy with a godlike figure, akin to the Dalai Lama, called the Bogd Khan at its helm, overseeing around 80,000 monks. (The Dalai Lama recently introduced a Mongolian child as the 10th reincarnation of the Bogd.) “They shot all the head lamas,” Orgil said. “They murdered all the teachers.” The fires from the monasteries were rumored to have burned for weeks. Christopher Kaplonski, a social anthropologist who has conducted research in Mongolia, has written that, though the total number of Mongolians killed between 1937 and 1939 is unknown, “credible estimates range from 35,000 to 45,000.” As evening fell, we arrived at the ger camp on the edge of the Gobi, a short drive from the Khamar monastery. We were the only ones there. Orgil had made me worried that there would be no pilgrims at all. Bolivia was a lesson in the imperishability of the sacred, but it had also shown me how places of pilgrimage, like the sacred crag on the Island of the Sun, could die. If you ban a religion for more than half a century, murder its clergy and raze its monasteries, as the Communists had in Mongolia, then maybe you do deal it a death blow? I was full of dark thoughts when the ger camp began magically to fill. I’d just finished a dinner of banshtai tsai, dumplings in a goat milk and tea broth, and retired to my ger, where I was watching the wood-burning stove cast shadows on the wooden lattice and felt walls, when I heard electronic music blaring into the Gobi. I stepped outside to see the neat rows of gers now brightly lit, noise and chatter pouring out of their doorways. Bottles of soda were being ferried back and forth and mixed with vodka. Prim, lightly made-up girls sat on the edges of what looked like the Mongolian equivalent of a frat party. “Who are these people?” I asked Orgil in amazement. “Pilgrims,” he answered. Some were part of a construction company, others students with exams on the horizon. They had come to draw energy from Shambhala. The rites the next morning were to begin before dawn, yet the pilgrim parties, with their Chaucerian feeling of intimacy among strangers, continued raucously into the night. Just before daybreak, at 4:20 a.m., we joined a cavalcade of SUVs off-roading through the desert, drawing ruby red parabolas over the dunes. Our first stop was a fertility shrine near the monastery. On a hill were two mounds of sand and rock with stone finials, connected by a beam that was wrapped in the blue prayer cloths. Women in puffer jackets with cartons of milk went back and forth between the shrine and the edge of the hill, casting their offerings of milk into the air. Orgil told me that no man could perform the rite unless his mother had died in the past 49 days, in which case he could perform it on behalf of her spirit. The sun rose over the Gobi, showing reddish earth and black-edged dunes. The sky was a cold, motionless blue. While the women performed the ritual, I spoke to a group of men in their late 30s and early 40s who worked for a real estate company in Ulaanbaatar. One was an economist, another a lawyer, a third a businessman. They had arrived by train from the capital. “I came here to recharge my energy and cleanse my spirit,” said Egi, the economist. (Mongolians use patronymics rather than Western-style surnames; in conversation, people often go by just one name.) “This place is a world energy center.” When I asked if the ritual had been handed down to him by his parents, he said, “They knew about it, but they were not authorized to come. We are the lucky generation.” He added: “This Shambhala reminds us that we are not just ordinary nomads. We had an enlightened one [Danzanravjaa] live among us.” Since the transition to the democratic era, Egi said, “Mongolian people have come to know that we have a great religious and cultural heritage.” Munkhdul, the businessman, said in halting English, “It’s a reconnection in modern times to the past of our life.” Some moments later, our band of pilgrims (about 50 to 100) reconvened outside the gateway to the Shambhala complex, where a pair of mesmeric half-closed eyes, painted on a wall of pinkish orange, gazed out at us, symbolizing the inward-turned sagacity of the Buddha. Stepping across the threshold, we found ourselves in a rectangular enclosure of red earth marked out by a perimeter of white stupas. It was like being in a Zen garden, where one proceeded from one station to another, performing a series of rituals and rites under an open sky. In the distance, the level sands of the Gobi fell away as far as the eye could see. It was an austere, heart-stopping glimpse of the void. Our guide, Haidav, was from the Gobi region. In his early 30s now, he had been selected as a boy by Gandantegchinlen (often referred to simply as Gandan), the country’s main monastery in Ulaanbaatar, to spend four years in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, where, at a center of Tibetan Buddhism — the Namdroling monastery, popularly known as the Golden Temple — he had been educated in the religion of his forefathers with the express aim of reintroducing it to Mongolia. As he led us into the Shambhala, he seemed less like a guide than like a monk re-educating his countrymen about a faith whose core precepts, such as the belief in karma and reincarnation, had survived the ravages of Communism, but whose rituals had to be relearned from scratch. Our group was composed almost entirely of Mongolians, but no one knew what to do at the various stations any more than I did. An 18th-century thangka adorning Erdene Zuu. At the genie’s belly, a low mound of dark rocks, Haidav told us to exhale all of our sins and bad thoughts, intentional and unintentional. At the site of Danzanravjaa’s ger, which was just a circle in the sand, we offered handfuls of grain. We wished that “with the help of the enlightened one, we would be reborn into the Shambhala.” Then we went to three other circles representing past, present and future. Haidav told us to walk not through but around them. We had open bottles of vodka in our hands and made offerings into the air. (Milk and vodka! It was a combination I would encounter time and again in this nomadic post-Soviet society.) Haidav told us not to wish for money or material things but only that which was regenerative — a child, rain or power. He placed a special emphasis on looking in, on harmony and balance. He said that all the bad things that happen to us, whether ill health or failure in our careers, were emanations of what was within and, in cleansing the inner sphere, we could succeed in the outer. Pilgrims to the Shambhala often roll on the ground to draw in the energy of the place. If pilgrimage is exteriorized mysticism, a way for human beings to grasp spiritual truths, the Shambhala felt almost like a cosmogram or mandala, a metaphysical scheme writ small. We came to a circle of red rocks that was the energy heart of the whole enclosure. Here, we sat down. Some lay on the rocks and rolled from side to side. The aim was to draw in the energy of the place. I talked to Samdanbazar, a 78-year-old herder from Töv Province, in the environs of Ulaanbaatar. She wore a gold-and-purple deel, a long coat of sorts, fur lined in the winter, with tiny earrings, her dyed hair whitening at the roots. Watching her roll back and forth, taking such obvious pleasure in the rite, I couldn’t help but ask what it had been like to be denied all of this for the first 45 years of her life. “We had to hide everything,” she said. “My father was a lama, so we had to hide our thangkas [Tibetan Buddhist cloth paintings], Buddhas and religious artifacts.” Our last station was the Golden Skull Hill, where a central ovoo overlooked the desert beyond. There we chanted, “Um sain amgalan boltugai” — “may there be peace with you” — and sang “Ulemjiin Chanar” (“Perfect Qualities”), a Mongolian folk song that Danzanravjaa had composed himself. Haidav was almost scolding in the care with which he instructed us to sing as a chorus. “Whatever your failures,” he said at the end of our morning at the Shambhala, “it’s because of your mind.” The Shambhala complex at Khamar. THE EMPHASIS ON interiority, on isolating the self as the site for spiritual advancement and failure, felt very different from the Christian pilgrimage in Bolivia. The focus there had been outward: on Mary, her miracles, on what she could give you. Here, almost everyone spoke of enlightenment from within and of certain corrosive human emotions, anger being among the gravest of them, that would impede that progress. In Mongolia, the texture of sin felt less like a crime against God than against oneself. Three symbols are often associated with Danzanravjaa’s life and thought: a female figure representing his love of pleasure; a swan symbolizing the arts; and, lastly, a scorpion signifying the human potential for self-destructiveness. Outside our ger camp, there was a giant metal sculpture of a black scorpion, its tail raised, surrounded by desert sands on all sides. It stood as a reminder of the cardinal sin in the Buddhist scheme: rage, which, like the myth of the scorpion, makes us our own worst enemies, liable to sting ourselves in the head. Kublai Khan may have laid the foundation for the rise of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia, but it was a man called Zanabazar — a monk, scholar and artist — who solidified its position. In everything from scripture to ritual, temple design and even religious fashion, including monastic robes with blue cuffs evoking the blue sky that Genghis Khan claimed to worship, the hand of Zanabazar is visible. At the Erdene Zuu monastery, founded by Zanabazar’s great-grandfather in the 16th century after the declaration of Tibetan Buddhism as the state religion of Mongolia, I witnessed an amazing scene, proof of the cocktail of motives that puts us on the road to pilgrimage. Erdene Zuu, with its green-tiled roofs in the Chinese style, is Mongolia’s oldest monastery, built in 1586. It is also located near the ruins of the Mongol capital at Karakorum, about 530 miles from Khamar monastery. On entering Erdene Zuu’s vast, grassy complex, with its perimeter wall crenelated with white stupas and nothing but big sky on all sides, I felt the spirit of a Mongolian camp. Nomadism harbors a disdain for materiality, yet it was hard not to feel myself on consecrated ground, even if only in historical terms. It was mainly from here that the descendants of Genghis Khan in the 13th century brought the world to its knees, from present-day Ukraine to Korea. The site had more recent memories, too. Of its 62 temples and some 500 facilities, the vast majority had been destroyed during the ravages of the 1930s. All around me, amid a handful of stupas and temples, were the flattened foundations of buildings in the religious complex. There had been 1,500 lamas here in the 19th century; there were fewer than 50 today. At the entrance, I spoke briefly to Mandakhtsog Monkhbaatar, who was in his early 20s, dressed in orange-and-red robes with those huge turquoise cuffs and high boots with blue piping. Like Haidav, he had spent years studying at the Golden Temple monastery in India, relearning the traditions that Communism had left Mongolian Buddhism too depleted to teach. Monkhbaatar’s great-grandfather had been a prominent lama in the southwestern province of Bayankhongor. When I asked the young monk about him, he said casually, “He was murdered,” then rushed into the great complex, where the morning chants were set to begin. A plump child lama in a plumed yellow cap appeared on the wooden watchtower of a temple whose sloping white facade evoked the Potala in Lhasa, Tibet — the winter palace of the Dalai Lamas. A conch shell sounded three times. Knots of pilgrims and tourists milling about outside drew near. Inside, monks sat chanting on wooden benches in a blue-ceilinged room hung with thangkas. Sutras wrapped in yellow silk rotated on a turnstile. As bells and chanting reached a crescendo, amid clouds of incense, a woman in a black-and-copper deel, her schoolteacher’s face tremulous with ardor, came rushing in. She then began to perform full-bodied prostrations in the aisle between the monks, some chanting, others laughing or charging their phones. Again and again, as the tempo rose around her, this thin, bespectacled woman prostrated herself in ecstasy, doing what is known in Sanskrit as ashtanga pranam, or the eight-body-part salute: hands, feet, knees, chest and chin. Watching her, I was reminded of a pilgrim I had once seen at a shrine in central India. He had looked like a bureaucrat or bank clerk, the ordinariness of his appearance only amplifying the extraordinariness of his actions. I’d watched him take a rock and place it on the floor a few feet away and then lie flat on the ground face down and wriggle his way toward it. He’d repeated the same gesture several times until he circled the shrine. “This,” the young Brahmin whom I’d been traveling with said to me, “is bhava” (a kind of rapture). Later, I learned that the woman at Erdene Zuu was a 40-year-old herder from Inner Mongolia, the region of the country that had remained part of China after present-day (Outer) Mongolia won its independence in 1911. She told me that she’d been a devout Buddhist since she was a child. “It’s the most perfect religion because it enlightens from within,” she said. But it wasn’t just Buddha who had brought her to Erdene Zuu. She said she came for Genghis Khan, too. “He was our ancestor,” she said of the founder of the Mongol Empire — who was not Buddhist but shamanic. “I wanted to receive the particular energy of this man here, in what was the capital of the Mongol Empire and of Buddhism.” Mongolian tourists on the outskirts of Nalaikh, one of the eastern districts of the capital, Ulaanbaatar. “So is this a religious pilgrimage for you, or a nationalistic one?” I asked. “It is both,” she said. “For Mongolians, this is a sacred place. This is ancestral land.” When I asked her if she felt Chinese at all, she said, “I’m 100 percent Mongol, even if I live in the part that’s China. We may live in different locations, but that doesn’t change the fact that we’re all Mongols.” When I asked for her contact details, she demurred, explaining that to share them was unsafe. Then, as I was walking away, she came rushing after me, imploring me not to post the pictures we had taken together on any social media or mention her by name in whatever I wrote. It was a reminder that political peril had always been part of the calculus of pilgrimage, whether in the Middle Ages, when Islam’s conquest of the Holy Land gave rise to local shrines, such as Santiago de Compostela and Canterbury, or now, for this pilgrimage-within-a-pilgrimage of a Mongolian herder, honoring her ethnic and spiritual ancestor, irrespective of any national boundary. A tourist camp at the foot of Khogno Khan Mountain in Bulgan Province, the site of a nature reserve. Growing up in India, I witnessed the intersection of religion and nationalism canalized into a militarized form of pilgrimage. In 1990, the Hindu nationalist leader L.K. Advani led a rath yatra, or “chariot pilgrimage,” from Somnath temple in the western state of Gujarat, where a major Hindu temple saw the first of many assaults upon it in the 11th century. The yatra, steeped in historical pain and revenge, was headed for the city of Ayodhya, a thousand miles away in Uttar Pradesh, where a 16th-century mosque — named after the Emperor Babur, who, incidentally, was a descendant of Genghis Khan and the founder of the Mughal (derived from Mongol) dynasty — stood on the alleged site of what was the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. The yatra was stopped before it got to Ayodhya, and Advani arrested, but the rage he had tapped into was not so easily contained. Two years later, on Dec. 6, 1992, a mob of kar sevaks, or religious volunteers, some coming as pilgrims with bricks for the construction of a new temple, destroyed the mosque. Religious riots ensued, and hundreds died. Ayodhya was the crucible that led to the ascendancy of Hindu nationalism in India. Two decades on, it gave rise to the majoritarian politics of Narendra Modi. Pilgrimage offered a release from the monotony of daily life, but it also galvanized people in the service of faith, often at the expense of other faiths, and over such a wholesale recruitment of people sent away from home full of religious zeal there forever hung the specter of a crusade. ORGIL AND I drove some 1,500 miles in five days, off-roading over what felt like the spine of Asia: valleys of spring flowers with ancient burial sites encircled by gently creased hills of green velvet. Orgil let me drive. The full expanse of the steppe, streaked with islands of shadow, opened up around us. Sometimes the sky would darken and a storm would roll in, turning the furrowed hills a morose green; then a herd of semi-wild, rain-drenched horses might assemble at the center of the road. I had never seen such emptiness. I felt myself in a country where animals outnumbered people many times over. It was as exhilarating as it was disquieting — the solitary sight of a ger in the distance, the cattle-covered crest of a hill dotted black, beige and white, as if the fickle hand of nature had taken up pointillism. It was easy to imagine this changeless landscape as one where people were especially attuned to the spirits of the natural world. “Throughout Mongolia it is believed,” Orgil said, “that if you pollute the water, the savdag will be angry at you, so we don’t even pour milk into the water, which we consider to be the purest thing.” That shamanic worship had fertilized Mongolian Buddhism, giving it its distinct character, which in turn, because of the influence of Tibetan Buddhism, already included certain esoteric teachings, practices and rituals, known in classical India as the Tantras. Monks praying at Erdene Zuu monastery. I hardly saw Ulaanbaatar until the end of my time in Mongolia. The location of the capital once known to Mongols as Khuree, meaning “monastery,” and later to the Russians as Urga, had not been fixed until the late 1700s and, even today, the city of nearly 1.7 million has the air of a giant encampment. A suburban sprawl of ger neighborhoods — ramshackle houses and yurts — surround a Soviet-style city center of decaying apartment blocks and bureaucratic behemoths touched up with blue glass and steel. Here, the Gandan monastery, the de facto Vatican of Mongolian Buddhism, was the only such institution allowed to remain partially open during Communism. Although it was closed during the purges of the late 1930s, Munkhbaatar Batchuluun, 45, a jovial lama who handled communications for the monastery, explained that it owed its survival to a cynical act of tokenism. Henry Wallace, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s vice president at the time, was in Mongolia on a fact-finding mission in 1944, and the Communist government wanted to show that some modicum of religious freedom existed in Mongolia. Thus the Gandan, though hollowed out, was permitted to stay open as a Potemkin monastery. Mongolia had come as close as any society to having eradicated a religious way of life, with deep roots in the social fabric, yet here, too, as so often on this pilgrimage of mine, the sacred had triumphed in the end. The newly built main hall of the Gandan was swarming once more with pilgrims and lamas. The recitation of the sacred Ganjuur sutra — a practice that had been repressed in Mongolia for decades, the renewal of which I was there to witness — was underway. Sitting in the coffee shop downstairs, in a building that was a teeming complex of ATMs, broadcast studios and what Munkhbaatar referred to as “donation receiving desks,” akin to cashiers at a bank, for the performance of various religious services, he described Buddhism as never really lost “but preserved in the minds of people.” Prayer scarves near an ovoo, or cairn, atop Khan Bayanzurkh Mountain, west of Khamar monastery. As a boy in the countryside in the 1980s, he recalled his grandfather — a lama who disrobed after the execution of his teacher — performing Buddhist rites under cover of darkness at an altar he kept hidden in his home behind a curtain. The other villagers, who praised Communist ideals of progress by day, would by night call on his grandfather, the disrobed lama, to perform healing rites. The Buddha outlined three freedoms, Munkhbaatar explained, of behavior, speech and mind: “The Communists controlled the first two, but they could not control our minds,” he said. On my penultimate night in Ulaanbaatar, I went to meet a woman named Gerelmaa, who went by Giimaa for short, for a shamanic ceremony. She lived in a ger neighborhood in a small house, with a yard full of rubble and rotting armchairs. A white Hyundai sat on cinder blocks, framed against the setting sun. Giimaa, a stout chain smoker in her 60s with a single upper tooth, had been an East German-trained electrical engineer under Communism before becoming a shaman in 1991. She’d often travel up to 5,000 miles a year on pilgrimages to Uvs Province in the west of the country to draw energy from the place where one of her ancestors, a powerful shaman in his day, had once lived. As we sat in an upstairs room full of taxidermy birds of prey, she told me that she mostly uses her shamanic powers to help people cure illnesses and dispel dark energy. Giimaa donned her heavy reindeer-skin coat, hung with a bear’s foot, a vulture’s claw, a wolf’s paw and brightly colored tassels. She made offerings of milk and vodka, which her spirit, like those of most people in Mongolia, seemed to relish. With a veil over her face and feathers on her head, she began to beat a pentagonal drum, dancing about the small room. The 17th-century Tuvkhun monastery in central Mongolia. The country had some 700 monasteries in the 19th century, but the great majority were destroyed during the decades of Communist rule. Once the spirit took hold, Giimaa slumped down on the floor and began to speak in the gravelly voice of her male ancestor. She had told me not to be scared, but it was scary. The spirit asked about my life, and I gave him the salient details: I was the love child of a Pakistani politician and an Indian journalist. My father had been assassinated by his own bodyguard. I was married to a man from Tennessee and had been unable to return to India to see my family since 2019, when Modi’s government had stripped me of my overseas citizenship only months after I wrote an article critical of his re-election. The spirit saw darkness in my life. He asked me to envision my home in the United States and, touching me, flew there to dispel that dark energy. My mind zoomed up, too, giving me an aerial view of this scene of a shamanic ceremony in a little house with the sun setting over the hills surrounding Ulaanbaatar. I thought of my fellow pilgrims: Eduardo Quintela, and his quiet tribute to his father; Aracely Alcón, full of gratitude for Santiago’s restored mobility; and the woman at Erdene Zuu on her perilous journey. Pilgrimage in that moment seemed less to me like exteriorized mysticism and more a rite of remembrance. The world would have us forget what is painful. It would have us move on and be free of the past; but both as individuals and societies, we have our loyalties to what we have known and endured. Pilgrimage gave us the illusion of a forward movement across space, even as it allowed an inner journey toward communion with our past. It was a crystallization of the poet Joseph Brodsky’s idea that “if there is any substitute for love, it’s memory.” Go behind the scenes to learn about Aatish Taseer's pilgrimage, including the dozens of books he read before his trip.

I r a q GRIEF, MEMORY, LOVE. I had not planned for this trinity of themes to become the substratum of my pilgrimage. Yet six months on, to arrive in Iraq in the nights leading up to Ashura — the climactic 10th day in a ritual period of mourning for the world’s more than 150 million Shiite Muslims — was to be confronted by a grief so fresh that the event that inspired it, the martyrdom of the Prophet Muhammad’s grandson Hussein in 680, might have occurred yesterday. In July, William Keo, a 27-year-old French Cambodian photographer, and I flew into the holy city of Najaf, 110 miles south of Baghdad, arriving just after 9 p.m. We were met at the airport by Khuder al-Harooni, our guide and translator, an avuncular figure in his mid-50s. Driving in from the airport, we watched the modern city of Najaf fall away in a blur of overpasses, brightly lit shops and restaurants and a headlight parade of white sedans. Outside the pedestrianized medieval center of town — where our hotel was situated — our taxi stopped in a sea of black. It was as if the whole city of one million were in mourning. “The ladies, too,” Khuder said, pointing to a group of women in abayas. The majority, though, were beautifully barbered young men in long robes, many with hipster haircuts and beards trimmed at the chin, all making their way to the center of the shrine city. A motorbike with two men riding pillion swerved to a stop in front of us. It had small red-and-black flags on its handlebars. The green letters in Arabic script read “Labaik ya Hussein” (“I am here, O Hussein”). 1 2 1 JULY 26 ARRIVAL NAJAF 2 JULY 27 KARBALA 1 JULY 28-29 NAJAF 2 JULY 30 KARBALA 1 JULY 30 NAJAF To be Shiite was to live with the pain, never more acute than at Ashura, of not having been there for Hussein when it mattered most. In 680, Hussein had hearkened to the call of Muslims in the garrison town of Kufa, a few miles east of Najaf. His grandfather the Prophet had been dead for less than 50 years. In that time, the small community of believers had grown into the vast Arab Muslim empire. Hussein’s father, Ali — the Prophet’s beloved son-in-law and cousin — was the last of the four Rashidun (“rightly guided”) caliphs until he died in 661 at the hands of an assassin who struck him with a poisoned sword as he prayed. The Shiat Ali (Partisans of Ali) were at first merely his followers, people who believed that the mantle of the Prophet could only be assumed by one of his bloodline. So when, in 680, Muawiya, the first caliph since Ali, died and the caliphate passed to his dissolute son, Yazid, the Shiat Ali implored Hussein to take his rightful place at the head of Islam. He would have believed he was defending the true faith of his father and grandfather when he rode out from Medina, in present-day Saudi Arabia, with 72 of his companions, to the Plain of Karbala, 50 miles north of Najaf. On the way, many tried to dissuade him, telling him that “though the heart of the city [of Kufa] is with thee, its sword is against thee,” but he rode on, like a man running to meet his destiny — a Christlike figure who sought to redeem the religion of his grandfather by forfeiting his life. At Karbala, Hussein found himself quite alone. Yazid, having subjected the living descendants of the Prophet Muhammad to days of heat and thirst, slaughtered them in a massacre that traumatized Sunni and Shiite alike. The main difference was that the Sunnis, who today are a vast majority of 1.9 billion Muslims, were able to move on, whereas the Shiites dedicated themselves to bearing witness to Hussein’s sacrifice — the word for martyr in Arabic, shahid, like the Greek martur, means “witness.” The mourning for Hussein was a dramatization of a historical wound. It gave Shiite Islam, with its origin in pain and defeat, an entirely different complexion from its Sunni coeval, which was energized by the political triumphs of that first century of Islam after the Prophet’s death, when the entire classical world, from India to Spain, succumbed to the new empire of faith. The split between Shiite and Sunni started as partisanship over who should succeed the Prophet. After Karbala, it hardened into something of a schism, even though the relationship between the two strains of belief was more symbiotic than mutually exclusive. At center, the holy shrine of Imam Ali in Najaf, among the holiest sites in Shiite Islam, contains the tomb of Ali, the Prophet Muhammad’s son-in-law and cousin. NAJAF ON THAT first night was like a town preparing for a medieval battle. We entered on foot through narrow side streets with knife sharpeners at every corner, whetstones crackling and sparking. Broad-bellied iron vats on low blue gas fires held vast quantities of rice and qeema, a spiced stew of meat and chickpeas made especially at Ashura. We dropped our bags at the hotel and walked into the floodlit precincts of the shrine of Imam Ali. A siren sounded, as if summoning soldiers to their stations. The dandyish men I had seen earlier stood in a line on a red carpet, brandishing swords in long, sweeping movements. Farther along, in an arena of sorts, the neighborhoods of Najaf were marching in procession, bearing banners, coats of arms and liquid-eyed images of Hussein wearing a dark, youthful beard and a green turban. At the center of each procession, a strongman carried a mashael (an iron chandelier) on his muscular shoulders, its 27 flaming lamps doused in crude oil. He plowed it into the crowd like a battering ram, wielding it around and around to the sound of drums, cheers and an excited cleric speaking into a microphone like a sportscaster. The crowd eddied, some with batons dancing concentrically around the wheel of fire, others collecting around two young men in white. They had cut their heads in a ritual called tatbir, and their faces were streaming with blood. As the tempo rose, a perimeter of cellphone screens formed around them. The modern technology, with its direct link to social media, amplified certain elements of bravado and exhibitionism that were already part of the performance. One of the men, bearded and handsome, who looked like he might be in his early 20s, fell to his knees and sliced at his bleeding head with the two daggers he carried in his hands, as if he’d meant to scalp himself. “We have come to return the sacrifice of Imam Hussein,” said the 18-year-old friend of the man on his knees, by way of explanation of his actions to me. “Imam Ali was killed by the sword. Now we remember their sacrifices.” In Najaf, Iraq, the night before the Ashura holy day, which commemorates the death of the Prophet Muhammad’s grandson Hussein in 680. I had been on the ground in Najaf for less than two hours, having flown 16 from New York. The heat, the swords, the blood, the air thick with the stench of oil — it was overwhelming. Khuder, sensing my fatigue and alarm, said, “All this was banned under Saddam, so the people are starved for such festivals.” Looking around, I realized that most of these men could not have been even a few years old when Saddam Hussein fell in 2003. Processions center on a flaming mashael, or iron chandelier. As we took a break on a quieter street leading away from Bab al-Tusi, the northern archway of the shrine, illuminated red that night, we came across a small stampede in the courtyard of a mosque. A young boy in a gold tunic and a green spiked helmet, astride a white horse, was surrounded by a crowd of older men. He was meant to be Qasim, Imam Hussein’s teenage nephew, Khuder explained. “Will I also be among the martyrs?” he had asked his uncle before riding out to his death. Najaf had its own version of Bolivia’s prestes, honored members of the citizenry who funded and organized service stations for pilgrims called mawkibs. Some provided food and water, others street theater and rites of mourning for Hussein. At one such mawkib, run by a black-turbaned cleric — the color denoting descent from the Prophet — I met Yasir Yaseen, a 23-year-old medical student from Najaf who lives in Istanbul and had returned to his hometown for Ashura. He had a light beard and a smile that exposed uneven teeth. He said that each night from now until Ashura was dedicated to a different episode in the re-enactment of the tragedy of Hussein, which was a procession of deaths — those of Hussein’s son (Ali Akbar), his nephew (Qasim), his half brother (Abbas), his 6-month-old baby (Ali Asghar) and others — culminating in that of Hussein himself. Looking down at the rectangle of men at our feet, many of whom had removed their black shirts and were thumping their bare chests in a slow, hypnotic movement, Yaseen, perhaps afraid I would misunderstand, said, “We’re not hurting ourselves for nothing. Fourteen hundred years ago, Imam Hussein went for something, and we were not with him, so one of the things we say during this period is ‘Ya letna kona ma’km,’ ‘We wish we were with you.’ ” Penance has always been a key element of pilgrimage. All major religious cultures use physical endurance and even pain as a conduit to draw closer to God. In Bolivia, some pilgrims made the approach to the shrine on their knees. Francisco Goya’s “A Procession of Flagellants,” painted between 1808 and 1812, shows figures in white with conical hats beating their own backs with flails. In India, I had seen exquisite examples of the mortification of flesh, almost as if it were necessary to negate the body for the spirit to speak. What made Ashura unique was its use of theater to create a two-planed reality: We were both in the present, mourning the past, and with Hussein circa 680 on the Plain of Karbala. Pilgrimage is nothing if not a spectacle, here in the dances for the Virgin of Copacabana, there in the different stations of remembrance at the Shambhala, surrounded by the drama of the Gobi on all sides. In Najaf, I felt part of an immersive street theater that erased the line between audience and actor and used the short plays unfolding around us to bring about that original Greek sense of catharsis as a cleansing or purification for our complicity in the events of the past. A likely apocryphal story states that Qasim had been betrothed to Hussein’s daughter on the eve of the battle and, at one mawkib, hundreds of young men under satin flags of black, green and red edged in gold sang to the poem “Groom of Karbala.” “This is a bride of sacrifice, a bride of blood,” Khuder translated. A cleric on the stage began the verse, and the young men, some carrying flowers in their hands, saluting in time to the music, sang the chorus back — “Beautiful as Joseph, this Lion of Karbala” — a cappella, their voices carrying up into the night air. The sight was mesmerizing. “They didn’t know Saddam’s persecution,” Wissam al-Turfi, an older man managing the crowd at the mawkib, told me, scanning the expanse of intent faces, “but their parents told them about it.” Given my experience of Mongolia, where Communism had driven Buddhism underground, and where the cycle of erasure and return was still playing out, I was curious to know what that persecution had looked like. “We still met,” al-Turfi said, “but in secret,” adding that not all displays of religion were suppressed under Saddam — it was the Shiite outpourings of passion around Ashura and Arbaeen, the commemoration of Hussein’s martyrdom that occurs 40 days later and entails a 50-mile walk from Najaf to Karbala, that were banned. “What was Saddam so afraid of?” I asked. “Imam Hussein,” al-Turfi said. “Imam Hussein is revolution.” The Great Mosque of Kufa during Ashura. For Shiite women, Ashura is a quieter affair. One night is dedicated to Zaynab, Hussein’s sister and the Prophet Muhammad’s granddaughter. WE HAD BEEN out all night, walking the streets of Najaf. As this last gathering broke up, plastic containers of freshly cooked qeema and rice began circulating. It was nearly dawn by the time we returned to the hotel. When I woke at noon it was 115 degrees outside and getting hotter. Looking out through an inch-wide opening in the heavy curtains, I saw a beige, treeless city of red plastic water tanks, cluttered rooftops and telephone towers. Our hotel was full of pilgrims. In the elevator, I met a Kuwaiti who said he had come to Iraq to witness the museebat, or “tribulations,” of Hussein. Downstairs, the lobby was packed with members of the mercantile South Asian community of Bohras, who were also part of the Shiite fold. The men wore gold and white, the women bright two-piece garments consisting of hooded smocks and skirts, the hem of one matching the hem of the other. The Shiite world is wide and various. There were the Ismailis in South Asia and Tajikistan, Zaydis in Yemen and Alevis and Alawites in Anatolia and Syria. Each group took a different line on succession to the Prophet, and each had a different focus of devotion, but none was indifferent to Ali. It is hard to overstate the mystical power of Ali as a counterpoint to Muhammad, not just within Shiite Islam but in Islam more generally. “His refusal to play the dirty game of tribal power politics,” writes Barnaby Rogerson in “The Heirs of the Prophet Muhammad” (2006), “would always have frustrated him from becoming an effective political leader of the Arabs. ... Ali is testimony to the fact that the most beautiful ideals must perish in the sordid world of human politics.” Ali is my middle name. It was given to me by my non-Muslim grandmother in India, which itself is testament to the wideness of his appeal. She would never have offered Muhammad — Muhammad was for believers. Ali was for all. On that first morning, watching Khuder kiss the door of the shrine of Imam Ali, it occurred to me that another way to think of the Sunni-Shiite split was in terms of what had been a recurring theme on this pilgrimage of mine — namely, the ancient division between materiality and pure abstraction that had riven Byzantine Christianity no less than Islam. On the one hand were shrines, images, sacred objects; on the other, a fierce love of formlessness born out of a loathing of consecrated ground, idols and clergy. The Wahhabis, who dominate the religious landscape of Saudi Arabia, practice an extreme form of Sunni Islam. To them, even the Prophet’s house in Medina could be destroyed without a thought (as it was in 1925) lest it become a shrine. Shiite Islam, by contrast, is a religion of touch and physicality, of clergy and sacra. People here made turbahs (clay tablets) from the earth of the two shrine cities of Najaf and Karbala. In this culture of the physical imbued with the sacred, Najaf and Karbala, with their grand ayatollahs and seminaries, along with the mosque in Kufa, where Ali died, form the points of a sacred triangle. The Imam Hussein shrine in Karbala the day after Ashura. Later that morning, we left Najaf through its vast necropolis, roughly four square miles of graveyard, with earth-rimmed roads running like avenues past graves of varying shapes and sizes, some simple constructions of brick and marble, others as big as mausoleums. Driving down the 45-mile road to Karbala, every inch of it lined with resting places for pilgrims, some mere sheds, some grand structures, I was confronted by another unintended symmetry of this pilgrimage: the return of the sacred, despite great political and historical upheaval. Iraq is one of four Shiite-majority nations in the world, the others being Iran, Bahrain and Azerbaijan. Saddam Hussein had deprived the Shiites of what was something of a holy land to them. When he fell, there had been a spontaneous eruption of Shiite pilgrimage. This year, the Arbaeen would welcome as many as 25 million people, making it the largest annual pilgrimage in the world. When I expressed my wonder that such a vast event could have been suppressed, Khuder said, “It happened, but in secret.” He himself had done it on multiple occasions, picking his way through fields at night. I had so far avoided the subject of the U.S. occupation of Iraq but, on the road to Karbala, Khuder began pointing to places where he had seen special operations involving Apache helicopters, or where, in the center of Najaf in 2004, he had witnessed a brutal showdown between the Mahdi Army, led by the cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, and U.S. forces with Abrams tanks. We had a young, restless driver whom Khuder kept chiding for his inability to sit still. That, he remembered, was what had gotten a driver he used to work with killed at a U.S. checkpoint. Upon hearing this, our driver, who loved biker stunts and made TikTok videos, casually said that his father had been killed by Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian founder of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia whose hatred of Shiites was legendary. “Madness,” Khuder said, “tragedy in every house.” The Shiite pilgrimages of Ashura and Arbaeen had themselves been targeted several times since 2003 by Al Qaeda and ISIS — and with each attack the Shiites, whose faith had been born in tragedy, drew an inexorable line to the primal sacrifice of Hussein. A child dressed as Qasim, Hussein’s young nephew who was killed in the same battle on the Plain of Karbala as his uncle. Outside the gilded dome and red air-conditioned maw of the shrine of Imam Hussein in Karbala, William was stopped on account of his camera. “They’re worried about tatbir,” Khuder said. “They’re afraid it will give the wrong impression.” The head-cutting practice remains controversial even among Shiites and has been banned in Iran by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei since 1994. Standing in the afternoon sun, I felt a chill as I saw younger and younger boys go by, dressed conspicuously in white, like sacrificial victims, in anticipation of performing tatbir. One boy actor, dressed in a green sequined tunic and a metallic helmet with a white plume, was surrounded by squadrons of drummers and flagellants beating their backs rhythmically with symbolic cat-o’-nine-tails called zanjeers. Another man, with a tank on his back bearing the image of Hussein with flowing hair and beard, threaded a course through the pilgrims, spraying them with rose water. Some mawkibs were handing out ice water, others, with garish signs, the lettering dripping red paint, poured lamentations into the street through loudspeakers: “We love you, Imam Hussein, with our body, our spirit, our blood.” As Khuder wrangled with the authorities, trying to persuade them to let William bring his camera into the shrine, I felt I understood the role of blood in the Shiite scheme. It was the ultimate line of continuity, a vessel for the transmission of memory, as well as raw genetic material — it spoke to that question of lineage that had torn apart the early Muslim world. When finally we were let through, we found ourselves on a palm-lined concourse. A red carpet, with misters overhead, led between the shrines of Hussein and his half brother, Abbas. The two-way traffic of pilgrims revealed Omanis in fine-hemmed robes with embroidered caps gliding past ruddy-faced farmers from Multan, Pakistan, stylishly turned out in black and gold. “Look at their faces,” Khuder said, overcome by their devotion. “They’re poor, but they come thousands of kilometers for the love of Imam Hussein.” PILGRIMAGE WAS A great equalizer. Within the elliptical sphere created by the road in and out of the shrine, a kind of democracy did seem to prevail. Men and women came as one before their maker. Occasionally the spell of equality was broken by the obvious prosperity of Gulf Arabs (or in Bolivia, of the richer Aymara women) in comparison with the poverty of their coreligionists, but it would be churlish not to admit the fellow feeling that pilgrimage engendered. At times, when it was edged with religious passion, it unnerved me. My father, who had been a governor of Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province, was assassinated in 2011 by a religious fanatic whom clerics and broadcasters had worked into a frenzy. The killer became a hero in Pakistan and when, after a delay of many years, he was executed, there were tens of thousands at his funeral. They used the same title for him that was used here for Hussein — shahid — and there is a shrine in his name on the outskirts of Islamabad where devotees bring offerings. As a reaction, no doubt, I was suspicious of the kinds of fraternities that religion fosters. In Karbala, I certainly felt a sense of shared humanity, but I never doubted it was an illusion. Even within Islam, on that concourse between the two shrines, the promise of fraternity was belied by the tales I heard of the oppression that Shiites faced at the hands of Sunni majorities. Twenty-three-year-old Farman Ahsan, with a prominent black mustache, had come by car from Lahore (my father’s hometown) via Iran, stopping along the course of a monthlong journey to do ziyarat, visiting Shiite holy places. “In Pakistan, you know how it is?” he said to me. “They throw stones at us. We need a permit to do anything. Here we’re free, we can do maatam [mourning rituals] wherever we want.” There was the 19-year-old Muhammad, who had come the long way to Iraq from Saudi Arabia via Kuwait using removable paper visas to avoid detection in his own country. “Otherwise, they kill him,” Khuder said, laughing mirthlessly. In Karbala, I met Syed Salman Raza — a Pakistani Shiite from Karachi — who had been coming to the shrine city for 35 years. He had seen it littered with bodies in 1991, when Saddam, in the wake of his invasion of Kuwait, brutally crushed the Shiite uprising, killing as many as 150,000. In his 50s now, he remembered having to bribe Saddam’s spies in order to perform the basic rites of Ashura. “We had to pay them just to be allowed to wear black,” he said, “and we were forbidden from talking to any Iraqis.” Raza also spoke of “the revolution of Imam Hussein.” When I asked him what made it revolutionary, he said, “It gives every oppressed man the courage to stand up to his oppressor.” As Ashura approached, the warlike atmosphere in Najaf reached a fever pitch. Empty days of blinding white heat gave way to nights of blood and ferment. The number of knife sharpeners in the side streets multiplied, even as the age of those with shaved patches on their heads, wearing what I now recognized as the white vestments of tatbir, fell into the single digits. “Why are they so young?” I asked Khuder. “They want them to not forget Imam Hussein,” he said. A mourning ritual observed at a mawkib, one of the outdoor stations that are set up for the holiday in Najaf and Karbala. A field hospital had materialized opposite the entrance to the holy shrine, ready for the bloodletting that was to ensue. Everywhere I could hear swords being drawn from their scabbards and the swooshing and hissing of blades slicing the torrid night air. Every evening outside of the shrine, we had seen two or three flagellants, some seeming almost to dance as they flicked flails equipped with blades across their backs. As the night of Ashura descended upon us, the scale of what was about to happen became clear. I had my heart in my mouth as I watched boys of 12 and younger approach a bald mustachioed man sitting at a stall like a street barber and wince as he used a dagger to draw blood lines across the patches of shaved head they proffered him. Then, at sunset, it began. Men came in battalions, some carrying gilded replicas of holy shrines, some led by the haunting figure of Imam Hussein in a white veil holding the arrow-pierced body of his infant in his hands. Behind him were streets full of men and boys in white bleeding from their heads. They seemed just to tap their scalps with their daggers, even as they dug deeper into pre-existing wounds. William and I wandered through neighborhood gatherings, where children with batons danced around a strongman bearing a mashael that dripped fire and oil. We saw grown men faint and be carried out by other bleeding men, their chests hard from the rust of dried blood. The security was heavy. Iraq’s interior minister was in town from Baghdad for the big night. We passed clothes racks hung with robes for those ready to exchange their funereal black for sacrificial white. Around 1 a.m., Khuder dropped us off at our hotel, imploring us not to step outside until he returned in the morning. A Russian Israeli doctoral student at Princeton had been kidnapped in Baghdad earlier this year, and throughout our time in Iraq, Khuder told anyone who asked that I was “Pakistani” and William “Cambodian.” “We have to be careful,” he said cryptically when I asked why, but I sensed it was his way of dissociating us from rich countries that could pay large ransoms. From the tinted windows of the hotel lobby we watched a predawn procession of men, hundreds upon hundreds, in states of elation and rapture, laughing, weeping, bleeding. The day broke over a ghost town whose dusty streets were full of oil stains and blood-soaked rags. Khuder picked us up just before 9 a.m. to take us to a passion play, known as a tashabih. Now and then, we passed an impeccably dressed cleric in light, floating robes with a black turban and green scarf. In his wake, like survivors of a carnage, came bandaged, bloodied men, their arms draped over one another, making their way home as if from a night of revelry. At the edge of town, an air-conditioned walkway, akin to what one might find at the airport in Doha, Qatar, led to a desolate stretch of pale, hummocky land enclosed by barbed wire. Beyond was the Sea of Najaf, a brackish lake, glittering feverishly in the distance. On a natural stage of sorts, fashioned from ravined earthen walls, a captivated audience in black of some several hundred formed a perimeter, while familiar short plays unfolded below them. The forces of Yazid, in yellow and red, as if color itself were a sign of corruption, were arrayed against Hussein’s beleaguered camp with satin flags in green, black and white. With every death, the women of the house, in white gloves and veils, ran between the battlefield and the tents emitting wails of sorrow into a loudspeaker. The role of Zaynab, Hussein’s sister and the Prophet’s granddaughter, was especially important. It was she who would live to tell the tale — she who would protect Hussein’s sole surviving son, Ali Zayn al-Abidin, who was too sick to fight, and thereby the bloodline of the Prophet. With each loss of life, Hussein addressed the audience, who stood agog in the heat with cardboard boxes over their heads to shield them from the fierce morning sun, asking if anyone was with him or whether he was alone. “Labaik ya Hussein,” came the solemn chorus of surrounding voices. It was a theater of the people in that most affecting sense, where even the poverty of the staging — the sun-bleached flags, the crackling loudspeaker, the melodrama and the audience in thrall — served only to deepen the pathos. On our return through the now-deserted town, we saw the field hospital had been cleared away. I was never more aware than at that moment of the creative power of pilgrimage. We think of tradition as static, its rituals fixed for the ages, but in fact within certain parameters it is constantly evolving, incorporating new elements and technologies. It was this inner vitality — “the modernity of tradition,” to borrow a phrase from the American political scientists Lloyd and Susanne Rudolph — that gives pilgrimage its ability to endure. Whether through the introduction of vodka into Mongolian Buddhist ritual, the use of cellphones and social media to enhance the performative aspects of Ashura or even the spirit of one pilgrimage resurrected in another, as in the case of fiesta in Copacabana, the survival of pilgrimage depended on its talent for balancing continuity with change. Tatbir, a controversial practice among Shiite Muslims performed during Ashura, is a ritual bloodletting, where men cut the tops of their heads with daggers or use blades attached to chains to self-flagellate as a way to honor the sacrifices and martyrdom of of Hussein. The last night — Zaynab’s night — belonged to women. “Never was there a woman of Zaynab’s courage,” Zahraa, a 22-year-old accounting student who co-owns a flower and gift shop in Najaf, said to me on the night of Ashura. “She’s an insp"

Methodology

The New York Times/Siena College polls of 3,662 registered voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were conducted in English and Spanish on cellular and landline telephones from Oct. 22 to Nov. 3, 2023. When all states are joined together, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.8 percentage points for all registered voters and plus or minus 2 percentage points for the likely electorate. The margin of sampling error for each state poll is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points in Arizona, Michigan and Nevada, plus or minus 4.5 points in Georgia, plus or minus 4.6 points in Pennsylvania and plus or minus 4.8 points in Wisconsin.

Sample

The survey is a response rate-adjusted stratified sample of registered voters on the L2 voter file. The sample was selected by The New York Times in multiple steps to account for differential telephone coverage, nonresponse and significant variation in the productivity of telephone numbers by state.

The L2 voter file for each state was stratified by statehouse district, party, race, gender, marital status, household size, turnout history, age and home ownership. The proportion of registrants with a telephone number and the mean expected response rate, based on prior Times/Siena polls, were calculated for each stratum. The initial selection weight was equal to the reciprocal of a stratum’s mean telephone coverage and modeled response rate. For respondents with multiple telephone numbers on the L2 file, the number with the highest modeled response rate was selected.

Fielding

The samples for each state were stratified by party, race and region and fielded by the Siena College Research Institute, with additional field work by ReconMR, the Public Opinion Research Laboratory at the University of North Florida and the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College. Interviewers asked for the person named on the voter file and ended the interview if the intended respondent was not available. Overall, 94 percent of respondents were reached on a cellular telephone.

The instrument was translated into Spanish by ReconMR, and Spanish-speaking interviewers were assigned to the modeled Hispanic sample. Bilingual interviewers began the interview in English and were instructed to follow the lead of the respondent in determining whether to conduct the survey in English or Spanish. Monolingual Spanish-speaking respondents who were initially contacted by English-speaking interviewers were recontacted by Spanish-speaking interviewers. Overall, 12 percent of interviews among self-reported Hispanics were conducted in Spanish, including 19 percent in Nevada and 13 percent in Arizona.

Weighting — registered voters

The survey was weighted by The Times using the R survey package in multiple steps.

First, the samples were adjusted for unequal probability of selection by stratum.

Second, the six state samples were weighted separately to match voter file-based parameters for the characteristics of registered voters by state.

The following targets were used:

• Party (party registration if available, else classification based on a model of vote choice in prior Times/Siena polls)

• Age (Self-reported age, or voter file age if the respondent refuses)

• Gender (L2 data)

• Race or ethnicity (L2 model)

• Education (four categories of self-reported education, weighted to match NYT-based targets derived from Times/Siena polls, census data and the L2 voter file)

• Marital status (L2 model)

• Home ownership (L2 model)

• State regions (NYT classifications by county or city)

• Turnout history (NYT classifications based on L2 data)

• Vote method in the 2020 elections (NYT classifications based on L2 data)

• Census block group density (A.C.S. 5-Year Census Block Group data)

• City type (Nevada only, added based on a post-hoc analysis of the difference between the weighted sample and voter file parameters. The weight had no meaningful effect on the topline result.)

• Census tract educational attainment (Georgia only, added based on a post-hoc analysis of the difference between the weighted sample and voter file parameters. The weight had no meaningful effect on the topline result.)

Finally, the six state samples were balanced to each represent one-sixth of the sum of the weights.

Weighting — likely electorate

The survey was weighted by The Times using the R survey package in multiple steps.

First, the samples were adjusted for unequal probability of selection by stratum.

Second, the first-stage weight was adjusted to account for the probability that a registrant would vote in the 2024 election, based on a model of turnout in the 2020 election.

Third, the six state samples were weighted separately to match targets for the composition of the likely electorate. The targets for the composition of the likely electorate were derived by aggregating the individual-level turnout estimates described in the previous step for registrants on the L2 voter file. The categories used in weighting were the same as those previously mentioned for registered voters.

Fourth, the initial likely electorate weight was adjusted to incorporate self-reported vote intention. The final probability that a registrant would vote in the 2024 election was four-fifths based on their ex ante modeled turnout score and one-fifth based on their self-reported intention, based on prior Times/Siena polls, including a penalty to account for the tendency of survey respondents to turn out at higher rates than nonrespondents. The final likely electorate weight was equal to the modeled electorate rake weight, multiplied by the final turnout probability and divided by the ex ante modeled turnout probability.

Finally, the six state samples were balanced to each represent one-sixth of the sum of the weights.

The margin of error accounts for the survey’s design effect, a measure of the loss of statistical power due to survey design and weighting. The design effect for the full battleground sample of registered voters is 1.29. The design effect for the likely electorate is 1.46, which includes the added variance due to incorporating the probability that a respondent will participate in the 2024 election."

Must Be This Tall to Ride

The Florida governor and presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis shot down rumors this week that he wears lifts in his shoes or heels to make him appear taller.

“You know your campaign is going terribly wrong when people only want to talk about your shoes,” said Charlamagne Tha God, guest host of this week’s “The Daily Show.”"
830,830,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/arts/music/henry-kissinger-nixon-in-china-opera.html,"As opera characters, both Nixon and Mao Zedong are faintly ridiculous and faintly noble, singing of their hopes and dreams in Goodman’s enigmatic, evocative lines. And Kissinger — Nixon’s national security adviser in 1972 and, a year later, his secretary of state, too — is there by their side, just as he was in history.

“When Peter Sellars proposed the idea of the opera,” Adams said in an interview, “he had just finished reading Kissinger’s ‘White House Years,’ which I seem to recall being pretty pompously self-congratulatory. I think there was some interest in cutting the secretary down to size.”

“Nixon” sought to unlock the ruminative depths beneath the headlines and set-in-stone positions surrounding a much-reported story. (Adams and Sellars would later do the same in “The Death of Klinghoffer” — another collaboration with Goodman, about a 1985 cruise ship hijacking by Palestine Liberation Front militants — and “Doctor Atomic,” about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb.)

The piece is not exactly sympathetic to Nixon, but it leaves audiences with a more poignantly human sense of him. The opera’s Kissinger, though, is never really human; he doesn’t get the exposure of thoughts and ambivalence granted to the other main players. “He’s not the character we go into great psychological depth with,” Adams said.

He’s not deep, but he’s smooth. In the first scene, as the Americans arrive, and awkward niceties are exchanged in the form of interjections, fragments and repetitions, Kissinger is the only one who sounds comfortable. The role’s bass register gives him sonorous diplomatic suavity; it’s soothing, while everyone else sounds strained and anxious."

Trump was facing multiple criminal trials.

Mr. Trump had called for the reinstatement of the death penalty after Mr. Salaam, one of five Black and Latino men exonerated in 2002 in the rape and assault of a female jogger in Central Park 13 years earlier, was first arrested.

“Karma is real and we have to remember that,” Mr. Salaam said in an interview on Tuesday.

Republicans had hoped to flip a seat or two, with Mr. Kagan and a candidate in the Bronx, Kristy Marmorato, thought to be their best bets. While Mr. Kagan fell short, Ms. Marmorato, an X-ray technician running on the Republican and Conservative lines, narrowly defeated Marjorie Velázquez, the Democratic incumbent in the northern Bronx.

Ms. Velázquez ran as a progressive in 2021 but backed away from that designation when she left the Council’s Progressive Caucus this year after its members were asked to sign a statement of principles that agreed to reducing “the size and scope” of the Police Department.

Republicans viewed Ms. Velázquez as vulnerable on the issue of public safety and development and focused heavily on the race. She was criticized for supporting a rezoning of the Bruckner Boulevard area that would bring affordable housing to the neighborhood."

In 1949, he arrived in Rio de Janeiro with $500, a suitcase full of French perfume that he planned to sell until he found work and a calling card for Lucjan Korngold, a fellow Polish Jew who’d fled to Brazil during the war and established his own architecture firm in São Paulo. From 1950 to 1958, Zalszupin worked with the older architect on structures largely defined by their hard angles and muscular volumes. He brought those ideas to his own São Paulo-based practice, Prumo, which he ran with José Gugliotta until 1986."

The American economy continues to gather strength. He has a solid string of policy victories. And his main Republican opponent, Donald Trump, is lost in a jungle of legal troubles.

The Democratic Party continues to score electoral victories as voters coalesce on the issue of abortion rights, as we saw in Ohio, Virginia and Kentucky on Tuesday night. But it is not clear at this point whether Biden’s fate is linked to down-ballot candidates or issues.

In Ohio, where abortion access and marijuana legalization won, and in Pennsylvania, where a Democratic State Supreme Court justice won, Trump appears to hold an edge in several polls. Biden is polling ahead in Virginia, where Democrats flipped control of the House of Delegates and maintained control of the Senate, but it’s also a state where Democrats have won the last several presidential elections.

And while abortion has been a winning issue for Democrats, it’s not clear yet if it will be on the ballot next November in any swing states — Arizona is one where it might be — or if Biden will effectively capitalize on the issue."

Now, Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, appears to be throwing cold water on those discussions.

On Monday evening, Mr. Sunak abruptly canceled a planned wide-ranging meeting with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece, which had been scheduled for Tuesday. According to the BBC, the decision was made after Mr. Mitsotakis, appearing on British television on Sunday, called for the marbles, which include statues of Greek gods and carved frieze panels that once decorated the Parthenon, to be returned to Athens.

Mr. Mitsotakis said on the BBC television program that sculptures had been stolen and should be reunified in Athens. “Where can you best appreciate what is essentially one monument?” he said. The current situation, with the sculptures split largely between the British Museum in London and the Acropolis Museum in Athens, was unsatisfactory, he added, comparing it to cutting the Mona Lisa in half and splitting it between two museums.

Mr. Mitsotakis has made similar comments throughout his terms in office, and Mr. Sunak has also repeatedly stated he would not change British law to allow the sculptures, sometimes known as the Elgin Marbles, to leave the British Museum permanently."

Not since the United Nations Charter was signed in 1945 has San Francisco hosted such a large gathering of world leaders, and city officials are hoping the event will give the city’s image a boost.

The attention peaked on Wednesday when President Biden met with President Xi Jinping of China for the first time in a year. The closely watched meeting drew demonstrators rallying against the Chinese government and others in support of it. (There were also protests about climate change and the war in Gaza, and at least one person was arrested on Wednesday.)

They recited prayers, sang the Ukrainian anthem and shouted “Glory to Ukraine! Glory for the heroes!” — the slogan around which the nation has rallied since Russia invaded last year.

The commemorations came on the same day the United Nations reported that its estimate of the number of civilians killed during the war so far had passed the symbolic threshold of 10,000. It cautioned that the actual figure was likely significantly higher.

The Maidan protests erupted on Nov. 21, 2013, hours after Mr. Yanukovych announced that he was rejecting the trade deal with the European Union in favor of closer economic ties with Russia. Many Ukrainians supported the deal with Brussels, seeing it as a way to lessen Moscow’s influence and improve living standards.

The protests were peaceful at first but escalated into violence as the police started firing live ammunition into crowds of demonstrators, who armed themselves with makeshift shields and clubs. The fighting killed more than 100 people, including a dozen police officers."

Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister. Russia is a member of the OSCE, but the foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said its planned attendance this week belied its “war of aggression and atrocities against its sovereign and peaceful neighbor Ukraine.”

Ukraine said it would also boycott the OSCE meeting in Skopje, North Macedonia. The U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, is expected to attend, as is Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union’s chief diplomat.

“We have to go, we are members of this organization, and we have to present our views and counter the views of Russia,” Mr. Borrell said on Tuesday at a separate meeting in Brussels with Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. State Department officials have given no indication that Mr. Blinken wants or expects to have contact with Mr. Lavrov, whom he last met in a brief encounter on the sidelines of a Group of 20 meeting in March.

At NATO, Mr. Blinken tried to assuage concerns about dwindling American support for Ukraine. A White House proposal to send Ukraine about $61.4 billion in additional emergency aid — out of an overall $105 billion plan — has stalled in the Republican-led House. That has left the United States with less than $5 billion available to contribute to the war. American military aid to Ukraine has so far totaled about $45 billion in weapons and equipment.

Ms. Braverman, the home secretary responsible for law enforcement, immigration and national security, has long been a divisive figure at the heart of the governing Conservative Party, whose provocative rhetoric has won support on the hard right while alienating more moderate colleagues.

On Thursday, there were calls for her resignation after she wrote an opinion piece for The Times of London that accused the city’s main police force of bias in its reluctance to ban a pro-Palestinian protest march scheduled for the weekend.

Manchin might even upend next year’s presidential race by running as an independent.

But whatever happens in those future races, Manchin has already had an outsize role in shaping U.S. climate policy, in both directions.

Manchin consistently blocked legislation that would have accelerated the transition from fossil fuels to wind, solar and other clean energy.

Bob Odenkirk once said that it was impossible for men to be funny and sexy. One problem discussing this subject is that you quickly face the eye of the beholder. The question of whether John Mulaney is handsome, it turns out, starts arguments. But the assumption in stand-up has long been that it’s better to be relatable or ridiculous than ravishing. When Anthony Jeselnik got started, he quickly noticed that his looks prevented him from getting laughs at self-deprecating jokes, so he built a villain persona.

Attractiveness has entered the maw of the culture war because the stigma against beautiful men has been fading.

When Pete Davidson sang, “I guess I’m hot for dudes in comedy because it’s an ugly industry” in a “Barbie” spoof on “Saturday Night Live” last month, the quip already seemed dated. An early sign of change may have been when the boyishly good-looking Jimmy Fallon took over as host of “The Tonight Show” in 2014. But you now see handsome men everywhere, even at small Brooklyn shows like the one where a comic introduced the endearingly cute Lucas O’Neil by citing not his credits but his cheekbones. The dimply Trevor Noah and Colin Jost — comics stunning enough that no one is shocked that they dated movie stars and models — are also part of what one annoyed late-night writer described on Twitter as Prom King Comedy, complaining: “You’ve let the popular kids appropriate the very art form that helped you deal.”

Every year it seems a comic gets buff. Kumail Nanjiani most famously, but Chris Rock showing off his abs in The Hollywood Reporter took me more by surprise. When The Daily Beast runs the headline “I Regret to Inform You That Jerry Seinfeld Is Hot,” it just goes to show that a new cultural anxiety has been born."

And yet on Monday morning, there he was, striding up the leaf-strewn driveway of 10 Downing Street to accept an appointment as foreign secretary from the current prime minister, Rishi Sunak. Mr. Cameron’s appointment must rank as one of the most remarkable comebacks in British political history.

For Mr. Sunak, who has presented himself as a change agent, it is not just a surprising choice, but also a deeply counterintuitive one. Mr. Cameron is nothing if not a bridge to the Conservative past. The decisions he made, and the policies he pursued, are vexing Mr. Sunak’s government today, a dubious inheritance that helps explain the erratic course of a prime minister in political trouble.

Few public figures are more closely identified with Brexit than Mr. Cameron, who called the referendum on leaving the European Union, campaigned against it, and then resigned after a narrow majority of Britons, including Mr. Sunak, voted in favor of it."

I don’t think we feel that way now.”

Alexandra Wrage, the founder and president of the international business corruption watchdog Trace, told me, “I don’t think there is any way Ivanka could have operated in these circles for as long as she has, in the shadow of her father, with these thuggish characters, and not have had questions about the qualities of her business partners.”

When the New York attorney general, Letitia James, charged members of the Trump family with inflating the value of key assets in order to secure more favorable financing, Ms. Trump got her own lawyer to represent her interests apart from those of her family. An appeals court later removed her as a defendant because of New York State’s statute of limitations.

Prosecutors subpoenaed her as a witness. They seemed to have in their possession way too many Trump Organization documents with her arabesque signature and too many of her emails in which nine-figure loans were being discussed. For years she had served as, at the very least, an elegant executive assistant opening the door between money and her dad.

Before her stint in Washington with her father, Ms. Trump was pals with the children of the American aristocracy — even if their parents scorned him as a parvenu and a golf cheat. A granddaughter of a woman who worked as a maid in the Carnegie mansion and a great-granddaughter of the widowed German immigrant who gave the Trump Organization its start, Ms. Trump was the first Trump woman to the manner born.

When President Biden meets with President Xi Jinping on Wednesday, China’s diplomats want to know what Mr. Xi will be looking at, and to make sure the scenery does not include protesters. Nearly every minute they spend together, from the number of steps it will take Mr. Xi to reach a chair when he enters a room to the specific timing of their handshake, will be part of a highly choreographed diplomatic dance, one designed to give them the space to try to defuse a year of bubbling tensions.

The ceremonial details have now been hashed out. But compared with the U.S.-China summits of a decade ago or more, the expectations for substantive agreement are minimal, at best.

Mr. Biden’s advisers have hinted at only one concrete agreement expected to emerge from the meeting, which is scheduled to be held near the end of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, called APEC, in San Francisco.

His name is everywhere: on a bright blue backdrop behind the stage, on the swag in the front room, on the side of a bus out front with the slogan “Strengthening the Spirit of Virginia Together.” The bus is a high-end prop for Mr. Youngkin’s “Secure Your Vote” tour, which has him crisscrossing the state to promote early voting. His attempt to reverse Republican mistrust of early and absentee voting is one way the governor stands apart from the leader of his party, Donald Trump. But it is not the only way.

Looking over the crowd, you can’t help but notice a dearth of Trump paraphernalia. One woman has on a blue “Nikki Haley for president” vest, and another one is rocking a “Moms for Liberty” T-shirt. Virginia’s Republican base has plenty of Trump love, yet it’s not a visibly MAGA-rific gathering. This makes a certain political sense: Joe Biden won this county in 2020, as did Mr. Youngkin’s Democratic rival in 2021. But the fact that Mr. Youngkin is aggressively campaigning in blue areas is not only a sign of his popularity, it differentiates him from Mr. Trump, who largely sticks to safe conservative spaces.

As Mr. Youngkin bounds into the hall in his signature red vest — smile beaming, cheeks ruddy from the wind — he radiates the upbeat, hunky-P.T.A.-dad vibe that helped carry him to victory in 2021. His voice ranges from an urgent whisper to a gargly rasp as he raves not about his personal grievances or some vision of American carnage, but about the “common sense” plans he and his party have for Virginia. He spotlights a handful of policy areas — jobs, tax relief, crime, mental health care, education — and contends that Republicans, and Virginians, “win” when sensible people come together. Mr. Youngkin’s sales pitch casts the G.O.P. as a party filled with practical folks who want to get stuff done — as opposed to the Democrats, he charges, who “just want to sell fear.”

Remember that “fear” line. It’s revealing about Mr. Youngkin’s brand of politics, but it’s also about as edgy as the guy gets. His performance is a far cry from MAGA."

Those allegations, which were made public on Tuesday in a sweeping federal case against Binance and Mr. Zhao, show how thoroughly he and his deputies understood that criminals were using their trading platform — and how little they did to stop them.

In many cases, they worked hard to keep the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, an arm of the Treasury Department that fights money laundering and other illicit financial transactions, from learning about their most notorious users, according to a regulatory filing by FinCEN. Mr. Zhao and Binance pleaded guilty on Tuesday to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and agreed to pay hefty fines.

In April 2019, representatives from a technology company working with Binance reached out to one of Mr. Zhao’s deputies to report that Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, was fund-raising for what it described as “Palestinian resistance” by soliciting Bitcoin donations, and that it had received funds through transactions on Binance.com.

In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan, who often prefaced it with a damning “tax and spend,” may have been the most effective of bashers. But the most blatant attack was in the early ’90s, after Newt Gingrich’s political organization GOPAC sent out a memo, “Language: A Key Mechanism of Control,” urging fellow Republicans to use the word as a slur.

It worked. Even Democrats began avoiding the dread label. In a presidential primary debate in 2007, Hillary Clinton called herself instead a “modern progressive.” She avoided the term “liberal” again in 2016.

Now the word is back. The portion of Americans who told Gallup pollsters they were “liberal” has increased from 17 percent in 1992 to 25 percent in 2021 (still lower than the proportions of those who said they were “conservatives” or “moderates”).

But the way “liberal” is being used now is more confounding than ever. Never Trump conservatives tout their bona fides as liberals in the classical, 19th century sense of the word, in part to distinguish themselves from hard-right Trumpists. Others use “liberal” and “progressive” interchangeably, even as what progressivism means in practice today is often anything but liberal — or even progressive, for that matter."
