In partnership with the owners of the Schnipper’s casual American restaurants, he serves a flattened fried onion burger with American cheese, and a classic smashburger with optional cheese and condiments, $7.25 for a single on a toasted, buttered potato roll, or $11.50 for a double. The meat is prime chuck, 75 percent lean. As for why the smashed burgers, they go back to what he says were the original hamburgers sold in the United States for more than 100 years. “I like history,” he said.

      "      Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina ended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination this week having failed to make good on his early promise as a candidate who could broaden the party coalition in a general election. And while he could still have a long career ahead of him in Republican politics, his failure to connect with the primary electorate ought to trouble those pining for a more diverse and capacious G.O.P.\n",

      "      Over just three days, the landscape for artificial intelligence has been reshaped drastically. On Friday morning, Sam Altman was the C.E.O. of OpenAI, the leader in commercializing generative A.I. through ChatGPT. By Monday, he had not only been fired by his board — he had also joined Microsoft, the start-up’s biggest backer.\n",

      "      There was little good news for President Biden in the latest Times/Siena poll of 2024 battlegrounds, which found him trailing Donald Trump in five of six key states one year before voters head to the polls. (That’s despite Trump being nearly as unpopular and fighting multiple legal battles; he is taking the stand on Monday in one of them. And, on PredictIt, which is watched by political experts, Biden holds a six-point lead on Trump.)\n",

      "      These are times that try our commitment to the Bill of Rights. Grief, rage and fear are radiating outward from the Middle East and tearing at the fabric of our own liberal democracy, especially on college campuses. The stories are already legion. Activists have ripped down posters of kidnapped Israeli women and children. The chancellor of the State University System of Florida ordered the deactivation of two campus chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine. At Cooper Union in New York City, Jewish students sheltered inside the library while pro-Palestinian protesters pounded on the doors. And in Ithaca, N.Y., a Cornell University student was arrested after publishing vile threats against the school’s Jewish community.\n",

Which matters more — the easing of inflation or the persistence of prices that many people can’t afford or accept? Low unemployment or high interest rates? Is the intensity of Americans’ bad feelings about the economy a sane response or a senseless funk estranged from their actual financial circumstances?\n",
